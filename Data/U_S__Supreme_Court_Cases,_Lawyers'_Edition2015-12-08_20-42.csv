 [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]  The question presented in each of these cases is
whether an application of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines violated the Sixth
Amendment.  In each case, the courts below held that binding rules set forth in
the Guidelines limited the severity of the sentence that the judge could
lawfully impose on the defendant based on the facts found by the jury at his
trial.  In both cases the courts rejected, on the basis of our decision in
Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 159 L. Ed. 2d 403, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004),
the Government's recommended application of the Sentencing Guidelines because
the proposed sentences were based on additional facts that the sentencing judge
found by a preponderance of the evidence.  We hold that both courts correctly
concluded that  [HN1] the Sixth Amendment as construed in  [*227]  Blakely does
apply to the Sentencing Guidelines. In a separate opinion authored by Justice
Breyer, the Court concludes that in light of this holding, two provisions of the
Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA) that have the effect of making the
Guidelines mandatory must be invalidated in order to allow the statute to
operate in a manner consistent with congressional intent.

I

Respondent Booker was charged with possession with intent to distribute at least
50 grams of cocaine base (crack).  Having heard evidence that he had 92.5 grams
in his duffel bag, the jury found him guilty of violating 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1)
[21 USCS § 841(a)(1)].  That statute prescribes a minimum sentence of 10 years
in prison and a maximum sentence of life for that offense.  § 841(b)(1)(A)(iii).

Based upon Booker's criminal history and the quantity of drugs found by the
jury, the Sentencing Guidelines required the District Court Judge to select a
""base"" sentence of not less than 210 nor more than 262 months in prison.  See
United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual §§ 2D1.1(c)(4), 4A1.1
(Nov. 2003) (USSG).  The judge, however, held a post-trial sentencing proceeding
and concluded by a preponderance of the evidence that Booker had possessed an
additional 566 grams of crack and that he was guilty of obstructing justice.
Those findings mandated that the judge select a sentence between 360 months and
life imprisonment; the judge imposed a sentence at the low end of the range.
Thus, instead of the sentence of 21 years and 10 months that the judge could
have imposed on the basis of the facts proved to the jury beyond a reasonable
doubt, Booker received a 30-year sentence.

Over the dissent of Judge Easterbrook, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit held that this application of the Sentencing Guidelines conflicted with
our holding in  Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435,
120 S. Ct. 2348 (2000), that ""[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any
fact that increases  [*228]  the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed
statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable
[***640]  doubt.""  375 F.3d 508, 510 (2004).  The majority relied on our holding
in   Blakely, 542 U.S. 296, 159 L. Ed. 2d 403, 124 S. Ct. 2531, that ""the
'statutory maximum' for Apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence a  [**747]
judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict
or admitted by the defendant.""  Id., at 303, 159 L. Ed. 2d 403, 124 S. Ct. 2531.
The court held that the sentence violated the Sixth Amendment, and remanded with
instructions to the District Court either to sentence respondent within the
sentencing range supported by the jury's findings or to hold a separate
sentencing hearing before a jury.

Respondent Fanfan was charged with conspiracy to distribute and to possess with
intent to distribute at least 500 grams of cocaine in violation of 21 USC §§ 846
, 841(a)(1), and 841(b)(1)(B)(ii) [21 USCS §§ 846, 841(a)(1), and
841(b)(1)(B)(ii)].  He was convicted by the jury after it answered ""Yes"" to the
question ""Was the amount of cocaine 500 or more grams?"" App. C to Pet. for Cert.
in No. 04-105, p 15a.  Under the Guidelines, without additional findings of
fact, the maximum sentence authorized by the jury verdict was imprisonment for
78 months.

A few days after our decision in Blakely, the trial judge conducted a sentencing
hearing at which he found additional facts that, under the Guidelines, would
have authorized a sentence in the 188-to-235-month range.  Specifically, he
found that respondent Fanfan was responsible for 2.5 kilograms of cocaine
powder, and 261.6 grams of crack.  He also concluded that respondent had been an
organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in the criminal activity.  Both
findings were made by a preponderance of the evidence.  Under the Guidelines,
these additional findings would have required an enhanced sentence of 15 or 16
years instead of the 5 or 6 years authorized by the jury verdict alone.  Relying
not only on the majority opinion in Blakely, but also on the categorical
statements in the dissenting opinions and in the Solicitor  [*229]  General's
brief in Blakely, see App. A to Pet. for Cert. in No. 04-105, pp 6a-7a, the
judge concluded that he could not follow the particular provisions of the
Sentencing Guidelines ""which involve drug quantity and role enhancement,"" id.,
at 11a.  Expressly refusing to make ""any blanket decision about the federal
guidelines,"" he followed the provisions of the Guidelines that did not implicate
the Sixth Amendment by imposing a sentence on respondent ""based solely upon the
jury verdict in this case."" Ibid.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]  Following the denial of its motion to correct the
sentence in Fanfan's case, the Government filed a notice of appeal in the Court
of Appeals for the First Circuit, and a petition in this Court for a writ of
certiorari before judgment.  Because of the importance of the questions
presented, we granted that petition,  542 U.S., 542 U.S. 956, 159 L. Ed. 2d 838,
125 S. Ct. 12 (2004), as well as a similar petition filed by the Government in
Booker's case, ibid.  In both petitions, the Government asks us to determine
whether our Apprendi line of cases applies to the Sentencing Guidelines, and if
so, what portions of the Guidelines remain in effect. 1

1  [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]  The questions presented are:

""1. Whether the Sixth Amendment is violated by the imposition of an enhanced
sentence under the United States Sentencing Guidelines based on the sentencing
judge's determination of a fact (other than a prior conviction) that was not
found by the jury or admitted by the defendant.

""2. If the answer to the first question is 'yes,' the following question is
presented: whether, in a case in which the Guidelines would require the court to
find a sentence-enhancing fact, the Sentencing Guidelines as a whole would be
inapplicable, as a matter of severability analysis, such that the sentencing
court must exercise its discretion to sentence the defendant within the maximum
and minimum set by statute for the offense of conviction."" E.g., Pet. for Cert.

 [***641]  [**748]    In this opinion, we explain why we agree with the lower
courts' answer to the first question.  In a separate opinion for the Court,
Justice Breyer explains the Court's answer to the second question.

[*230]  II

[***LEdHR3] [3]  [***LEdHR4] [4]   [HN2] It has been settled throughout our
history that the Constitution protects every criminal defendant ""against
conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary
to constitute the crime with which he is charged.""  In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358,
364, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368, 90 S. Ct. 1068 (1970).  It is equally clear that the
""Constitution gives a criminal defendant the right to demand that a jury find
him guilty of all the elements of the crime with which he is charged.""  United
States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 511, 132 L. Ed. 2d 444, 115 S. Ct. 2310 (1995).
These basic precepts, firmly rooted in the common law, have provided the basis
for recent decisions interpreting modern criminal statutes and sentencing
procedures.

In   Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 230, 143 L. Ed. 2d 311, 119 S. Ct.
1215 (1999), we considered the federal carjacking statute, which provides three
different maximum sentences depending on the extent of harm to the victim: 15
years in jail if there was no serious injury to a victim, 25 years if there was
""serious bodily injury,"" and life in prison if death resulted.  18 U.S.C. § 2119
(1988 ed., Supp. V) [18 USCS § 2119]. In spite of the fact that the statute ""at
first glance has a look to it suggesting [that the provisions relating to the
extent of harm to the victim] are only sentencing provisions,""  526 U.S., at
232, 143 L. Ed. 2d 311, 119 S. Ct. 1215, we concluded that the harm to the
victim was an element of the crime.  That conclusion was supported by the
statutory text and structure, and was influenced by our desire to avoid the
constitutional issues implicated by a contrary holding, which would have reduced
the jury's role ""to the relative importance of low-level gatekeeping.""  Id., at
244, 143 L. Ed. 2d 311, 119 S. Ct. 1215.  Foreshadowing the result we reach
today, we noted that our holding was consistent with   [HN3] a ""rule requiring
jury determination of facts that raise a sentencing ceiling"" in state and
federal sentencing guidelines systems.   Id., at 251-252, n. 11, 143 L. Ed. 2d
311, 119 S. Ct. 1215

In  Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435, 120 S. Ct. 2348
(2000), the defendant pleaded guilty to second-degree possession of a firearm
for an unlawful purpose, which carried a prison term  [*231]  of 5-to-10 years.
Thereafter, the trial court found that his conduct had violated New Jersey's
""hate crime"" law because it was racially motivated, and imposed a 12-year
sentence. This Court set aside the enhanced sentence. We held: ""Other than the
fact of a prior conviction, any fact that  [***642]  increases the penalty for a
crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and
proved beyond a reasonable doubt.""  Id., at 490, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435, 120 S. Ct.
2348.

[HN4] The fact that New Jersey labeled the hate crime a ""sentence enhancement""
rather than a separate criminal act was irrelevant for constitutional purposes.
Id., at 478, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435, 120 S. Ct. 2348.  As a matter of simple justice,
it seemed obvious that the procedural safeguards designed to protect Apprendi
from punishment for the possession of a firearm should apply equally to his
violation of the hate crime statute.  Merely using the label ""sentence
enhancement"" to describe the latter did not provide a principled basis for
treating the two crimes differently.   Id., at 476, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435, 120 S.
Ct. 2348.

In  Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, 153 L. Ed. 2d 556, 122 S. Ct. 2428 (2002), we
reaffirmed our conclusion that the characterization of critical facts is
constitutionally irrelevant.  There, we held that it was [**749]  impermissible
for ""the trial judge, sitting alone"" to determine the presence or absence of the
aggravating factors required by Arizona law for imposition of the death penalty.
Id., at 588-589, 153 L. Ed. 2d 556, 122 S. Ct. 2428.   [HN5] ""If a State makes
an increase in a defendant's authorized punishment contingent on the finding of
a fact, that fact--no matter how the State labels it--must be found by a jury
beyond a reasonable doubt.""   Id., at 602, 153 L. Ed. 2d 556, 122 S. Ct. 2428.
Our opinion made it clear that ultimately, while the procedural error in Ring's
case might have been harmless because the necessary finding was implicit in the
jury's guilty verdict,  id., at 609, n. 7, 153 L. Ed. 2d 556, 122 S. Ct. 2428,
""the characterization of a fact or circumstance as an 'element' or a 'sentencing
factor' is not determinative of the question 'who decides,' judge or jury,""
id., at 605, 153 L. Ed. 2d 556, 122 S. Ct. 2428.

In  Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 159 L. Ed. 2d 403, 124 S. Ct. 2531
(2004), we dealt with a determinate sentencing scheme similar to the Federal
[*232]  Sentencing Guidelines. There the defendant pleaded guilty to kidnaping,
a class B felony punishable by a term of not more than 10 years.  Other
provisions of Washington law, comparable to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines,
mandated a ""standard"" sentence of 49-to-53 months, unless the judge found
aggravating facts justifying an exceptional sentence. Although the prosecutor
recommended a sentence in the standard range, the judge found that the defendant
had acted with ""'deliberate cruelty'"" and sentenced him to 90 months.   Id., at
300, 159 L. Ed. 2d 403, 124 S. Ct. 2531.

For reasons explained in Jones, Apprendi, and Ring,  [HN6] the requirements of
the Sixth Amendment were clear.  The application of Washington's sentencing
scheme violated the defendant's right to have the jury find the existence of
""'any particular fact'"" that the law makes essential to his punishment.   542
U.S., at 301, 159 L. Ed. 2d 403, 124 S. Ct. 2531.  That right is implicated
whenever a judge seeks to impose a sentence that is not solely based on ""facts
reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.""  Id., at 303, 159
L. Ed. 2d 403, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (emphasis deleted).  We rejected the State's
argument that the jury verdict was sufficient to authorize a sentence within the
general 10-year  [***643]  sentence for class B felonies, noting that under
Washington law, the judge was required to find additional facts in order to
impose the greater 90-month sentence. Our precedents, we explained, make clear
""that  [HN7] the 'statutory maximum' for Apprendi purposes is the maximum
sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the
jury verdict or   admitted by the defendant."" Ibid. (emphasis in original).  The
determination that the defendant acted with deliberate cruelty, like the
determination in Apprendi that the defendant acted with racial malice, increased
the sentence that the defendant could have otherwise received.  Since this fact
was found by a judge using a preponderance of the evidence standard, the
sentence violated Blakely's Sixth Amendment rights.

[***LEdHR1A]   [*233]  As the dissenting opinions in Blakely recognized, there
is no distinction of constitutional significance between the Federal Sentencing
Guidelines and the Washington procedures at issue in that case.  See, e.g.,  542
U.S., at 325, 159 L. Ed. 2d 403, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (opinion of O'Connor, J.) (""The
structure of the Federal Guidelines likewise does not, as the Government
halfheartedly suggests, provide any grounds for distinction.  . . .  If
anything, the structural differences that do exist make the Federal Guidelines
more vulnerable to attack"").  This conclusion rests on the premise, common to
both systems, that the relevant sentencing rules are mandatory [**750]  and
impose binding requirements on all sentencing judges.

[***LEdHR5] [5]  [***LEdHR6] [6] If the Guidelines as currently written could be
read as merely advisory provisions that recommended, rather than required, the
selection of particular sentences in response to differing sets of facts, their
use would not implicate the Sixth Amendment.   [HN8] We have never doubted the
authority of a judge to exercise broad discretion in imposing a sentence within
a statutory range.  See  Apprendi, 530 U.S., at 481, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435, 120 S.
Ct. 2348;  Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 241, 246, 93 L. Ed. 1337, 69 S. Ct.
1079 (1949).  Indeed, everyone agrees that the constitutional issues presented
by these cases would have been avoided entirely if Congress had omitted from the
SRA the provisions that make the Guidelines binding on district judges; it is
that circumstance that makes the Court's answer to the second question presented
possible.  For  [HN9] when a trial judge exercises his discretion to select a
specific sentence within a defined range, the defendant has no right to a jury
determination of the facts that the judge deems relevant.

The Guidelines as written, however, are not advisory; they are mandatory and
binding on all judges. 2 While subsection (a) of § 3553 [*234]  of the
sentencing statute 3 lists the Sentencing Guidelines as one factor to be
considered in imposing a sentence, subsection (b) directs that the court ""shall
impose a sentence of the kind, and within the range"" established by the
Guidelines, subject to departures in specific, limited cases.  (Emphasis added.)
Because  [***644]  they are binding on judges, we have consistently held that
the Guidelines have the force and effect of laws.  See, e.g.,  Mistretta v.
United States, 488 U.S. 361, 391, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714, 109 S. Ct. 647 (1989);
Stinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36, 42, 123 L. Ed. 2d 598, 113 S. Ct. 1913
(1993).

2 In  Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714, 109 S. Ct.
647 (1989), we pointed out that Congress chose explicitly to adopt a
""mandatory-guideline system"" rather than a system that would have been ""only
advisory,"" and that the statute ""makes the Sentencing Commission's guidelines
binding on the courts.""  Id., at 367, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714, 109 S. Ct. 647.

 The availability of a departure in specified circumstances does not avoid the
constitutional issue, just as it did not in Blakely itself.  The Guidelines
permit departures from the prescribed sentencing range in cases in which the
judge ""finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a
kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing
Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence
different from that described."" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) [18
USCS § 3553(b)(1)].  At first glance, one might believe that the ability of a
district judge to depart from the Guidelines means that she is bound only by the
statutory maximum. Were this the case, there would be no Apprendi problem.
Importantly, however, departures are not available in every case, and in fact
are unavailable in most.  In most cases, as a matter of law, the Commission will
have adequately taken all relevant factors into account, and no departure will
be legally permissible.  In those instances, the judge is bound to impose a
sentence within the Guidelines range.  It was for this reason that we rejected a
similar argument in Blakely, holding that although the Washington statute
allowed the judge to impose a sentence outside the sentencing range for
""'substantial and compelling reasons,'"" that exception was not available for
Blakely himself.   542 U.S., at 299, 159 L. Ed. 2d 403, 124 S. Ct. 2531.  The
[**751]  sentencing judge  [*235]  would have been reversed had he invoked the
departure section to justify the sentence.

Booker's case illustrates the mandatory nature of the Guidelines. The jury
convicted him of possessing at least 50 grams of crack in violation of 21 U.S.C.
§ 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) [21 USCS § 841(b)(1)(A)(iii)] based on evidence that he had
92.5 grams of crack in his duffel bag.  Under these facts, the Guidelines
specified an offense level of 32, which, given the defendant's criminal history
category, authorized a sentence of 210-to-262 months.  See USSG § 2D1.1(c)(4).
Booker's is a run-of-the-mill drug case, and does not present any factors that
were inadequately considered by the Commission.  The sentencing judge would
therefore have been reversed had he not imposed a sentence within the level 32
Guidelines range.

[***LEdHR1A]  Booker's actual sentence, however, was 360 months, almost 10 years
longer than the Guidelines range supported by the jury verdict alone.  To reach
this sentence, the judge found facts beyond those found by the jury: namely,
that Booker possessed 566 grams of crack in addition to the 92.5 grams in his
duffel bag.  The jury never heard any evidence of the additional drug quantity,
and the judge found it true by a preponderance of the evidence.  Thus, just as
in Blakely, ""the jury's verdict alone does not authorize the sentence. The judge
acquires that authority only upon finding some additional fact.""  542 U.S., at
305, 159 L. Ed. 2d 403, 124 S. Ct. 2531.  There is no relevant distinction
between the sentence imposed pursuant to the Washington statutes in Blakely and
[***645]  the sentences imposed pursuant to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in
these cases.

In his dissent,  post, at 327-329, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 651-652, Justice Breyer
argues on historical grounds that the Guidelines scheme is constitutional across
the board.  He points to traditional judicial authority to increase sentences to
take account of any unusual blameworthiness in the manner employed in committing
a crime, an authority that the Guidelines require to be exercised consistently
throughout the system.   [HN10] This tradition,  [*236]  however, does not
provide a sound guide to enforcement of the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of a
jury trial in today's world.

It is quite true that once determinate sentencing had fallen from favor,
American judges commonly determined facts justifying a choice of a heavier
sentence on account of the manner in which particular defendants acted.
Apprendi, 530 U.S., at 481, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435, 120 S. Ct. 2348.  In 1986,
however, our own cases first recognized a new trend in the legislative
regulation of sentencing when we considered the significance of facts selected
by legislatures that not only authorized, or even mandated, heavier sentences
than would otherwise have been imposed, but increased the range of sentences
possible for the underlying crime.  See  McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79,
87-88, 91 L. Ed. 2d 67, 106 S. Ct. 2411 (1986).  Provisions for such
enhancements of the permissible sentencing range reflected growing and wholly
justified legislative concern about the proliferation and variety of drug crimes
and their frequent identification with firearms offences.

The effect of the increasing emphasis on facts that enhanced sentencing ranges,
however, was to increase the judge's power and diminish that of the jury.  It
became the judge, not the jury, who determined the upper limits of sentencing,
and the facts determined were not required to be raised before trial or proved
by more than a preponderance.

As the enhancements became greater, the jury's finding of the underlying crime
became less significant.  And the enhancements became very serious indeed.  See,
[**752]  e.g.,  Jones, 526 U.S., at 230-231, 143 L. Ed. 2d 311, 119 S. Ct. 1215
(judge's finding increased the maximum sentence from 15 to 25 years); respondent
Booker's case (from 262 months to a life sentence); respondent Fanfan's case
(from 78 to 235 months);  United States v. Rodriguez, 73 F.3d 161, 162-163 (CA7
1996) (Posner, C. J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (from
approximately 54 months to a life sentence);  United States v. Hammoud, 381 F.3d
316,  [*237]  361-362 (CA4 2004) (en banc) (Motz, J., dissenting) (actual
sentence increased from 57 months to 155 years).

As it thus became clear that sentencing was no longer taking place in the
tradition that Justice Breyer invokes, the Court was faced with the issue of
preserving an ancient guarantee under a new set of circumstances.  The new
sentencing practice forced the Court to address the question how the right of
jury trial could be preserved, in a meaningful way guaranteeing that the jury
would still stand between the individual and the power of the government under
the new sentencing regime.  And it is the new circumstances, not a tradition or
practice that the new circumstances have superseded, that have led us to the
answer first considered  [***646]  in Jones and developed in Apprendi and
subsequent cases culminating with this one.  It is an answer not motivated by
Sixth Amendment formalism, but by the need to preserve Sixth Amendment
substance.

III

[***LEdHR1A]  The Government advances three arguments in support of its
submission that we should not apply our reasoning in Blakely to the Federal
Sentencing Guidelines. It contends that Blakely is distinguishable because the
Guidelines were promulgated by a Commission rather than the Legislature; that
principles of stare decisis require us to follow four earlier decisions that are
arguably inconsistent with Blakely; and that the application of Blakely to the
Guidelines would conflict with separation-of-powers principles reflected in
Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714, 109 S. Ct. 647
(1989).  These arguments are unpersuasive.

Commission v. Legislature:

[***LEdHR7] [7] In our judgment  [HN11] the fact that the Guidelines were
promulgated by the Sentencing Commission, rather than Congress, lacks
constitutional significance.  In order to impose the defendants' sentences under
the Guidelines, the judges in these  [*238]  cases were required to find an
additional fact, such as drug quantity, just as the judge found the additional
fact of serious bodily injury to the victim in Jones. As far as the defendants
are concerned, they face significantly higher sentences--in Booker's case almost
10 years higher--because a judge found true by a preponderance of the evidence a
fact that was never submitted to the jury.   [HN12] Regardless of whether
Congress or a Sentencing Commission concluded that a particular fact must be
proved in order to sentence a defendant within a particular range,  ""[t]he
Framers would not have thought it too much to demand that, before depriving a
man of [ten] more years of his liberty, the State should suffer the modest
inconvenience of submitting its accusation to 'the unanimous suffrage of twelve
of his equals and neighbours,' rather than a lone employee of the State.""
Blakely, 542 U.S., at 313-314, 159 L. Ed. 2d 403, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (citation
omitted).

The Government correctly notes that in Apprendi we referred to ""'any fact that
increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum . . .
.'"" Brief for United States 15 (quoting  Apprendi, 530 U.S., at 490, 147 L. Ed.
2d 435, 120 S. Ct. 2348 (emphasis in Brief for United States)).  The simple
answer, of course, is that we were only considering a statute in that [**753]
case; we expressly declined to consider the Guidelines. See  Apprendi, 530 U.S.,
at 497, n. 21, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435, 120 S. Ct. 2348.  It was therefore appropriate
to state the rule in that case in terms of a ""statutory maximum"" rather than
answering a question not properly before us.

More important than the language used in our holding in Apprendi are the
principles we sought to vindicate.  Those principles are unquestionably
applicable to the Guidelines. They are not the product of recent innovations in
our jurisprudence, but rather have their genesis in the ideals our
constitutional tradition assimilated from the common law.  See  Jones, 526 U.S.,
at 244-248, 143 L. Ed. 2d 311, 119 S. Ct. 1215.  The Framers of the Constitution
understood the threat of ""judicial despotism"" that could  [***647]  arise from
""arbitrary punishments upon arbitrary convictions""  [*239]  without the benefit
of a jury in criminal cases.  The Federalist No. 83, p 499 (C. Rossiter ed.
1961) (A. Hamilton).  The Founders presumably carried this concern from England,
in which the right to a jury trial had been enshrined since the Magna Carta.  As
we noted in Apprendi:


     ""[T]he historical foundation for our recognition of these principles
     extends down centuries into the common law.   [HN13] '[T]o guard
     against a spirit of oppression and tyranny on the part of rulers,' and
     'as the great bulwark of [our] civil and political liberties,' trial
     by jury has been understood to require that 'the truth of every
     accusation, whether preferred in the shape of indictment,
     information, or appeal, should afterwards be confirmed by the
     unanimous suffrage of twelve of [the defendant's] equals and
     neighbours . . . .'""  530 U.S., at 477, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435, 120 S. Ct.
     2348 (citations omitted).



Regardless of whether the legal basis of the accusation is in a statute or in
guidelines promulgated by an independent commission, the principles behind the
jury trial right are equally applicable.

Stare Decisis:

[***LEdHR1A]  The Government next argues that four recent cases preclude our
application of Blakely to the Sentencing Guidelines. We disagree.   [HN14] In
United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S. 87, 122 L. Ed. 2d 445, 113 S. Ct. 1111
(1993), we held that the provisions of the Guidelines that require a sentence
enhancement if the judge determines that the defendant committed perjury do not
violate the privilege of the accused to testify on her own behalf.  There was no
contention that the enhancement was invalid because it resulted in a more severe
sentence than the jury verdict had author"
"            CLAUDE M. BALLARD, et ux., Petitioners v. COMMISSIONER OF            INTERNAL REVENUE ESTATE OF BURTON W. KANTER, DECEASED, et               al., Petitioners v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE",544 U.S. 40,"

 [*44]  [**1274]   Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A]  These cases concern the Tax Court's employment of special trial
judges, auxiliary officers appointed by the Chief Judge of the Tax Court to
assist in the work of the court.  See 26 U.S.C. § 7443A(a) [26 USCS § 7443A(a)].
[HN1] Unlike Tax Court judges, who are appointed by the President for 15-year
terms, see § 7443(b), (e), special trial judges have no fixed term of office, §
7443A(a).  Any case before the Tax Court may be assigned to a special trial
judge for hearing.  Ultimate decision in cases involving tax deficiencies that
exceed $50,000, however, is reserved for the Tax Court.  § 7443A(c).

[HN2] Tax Court Rule 183 governs the two-tiered proceedings in which a  [***235]
special trial judge hears the case, but the Tax Court itself renders the final
decision. The Rule directs that, after  [*45]  trial and submission of briefs,
the special trial judge ""shall submit a report, including findings of fact and
opinion, to the Chief Judge, and the Chief Judge will assign the case to a Judge
. . . of the Court."" Tax Ct Rule 183(b), 26 USC App, p 1619 [USCS Court Rules,
Tax Court Rules, Rule 183(b)].  In acting on the report, the Tax Court judge to
whom the case is assigned must give ""[d]ue regard . . . to the circumstance that
the [s]pecial [t]rial [j]udge had the opportunity to evaluate the credibility of
the witnesses."" Rule 183(c), ibid. Further, factfindings contained in the report
""shall be presumed to be correct."" Ibid. The final Tax Court decision ""may adopt
the [s]pecial [t]rial [j]udge's report or may modify it or may reject it in
whole or in part."" Ibid.

Until 1983, special trial judge reports, as submitted to the Chief Judge, were
made public and were included in the record on appeal.  A rule revision that
year deleted the requirement that, upon submission of the special trial judge's
report, ""a copy . . . shall forthwith be served on each party."" See Rule 183
note,  81 T.C. 1069-1070 (1984).  Correspondingly, the revision deleted the
prior provision giving parties an [**1275]  opportunity to set forth
""exceptions"" to the report.  Ibid. 1 Coincident with those rule changes, the Tax
Court significantly altered its practice in cases referred for trial, but not
final decision, to special trial judges.  Since the January  [*46]  16, 1984
effective date of the rule revision, the post-trial report submitted to the
Chief Judge, then transmitted to the Tax Court judge assigned to make the final
decision, has been both withheld from the public and excluded from the record on
appeal.  Further, since that time, Tax Court judges have refrained from
disclosing, in any case, whether the final decision in fact ""modi[fies]"" or
""reject[s] [the special trial judge's initial report] in whole or in part."" Cf.
Rule 183(c), 26 USC App, p 1619 [USCS Court Rules, Tax Court Rules, Rule 183(c)
].  Instead, the final decision invariably begins with a stock statement that
the Tax Court judge ""agrees with and adopts the opinion of the [s]pecial [t]rial
[j]udge."" See, e.g.,  Investment Research Assoc., Ltd. v. Commissioner, 78 TCM
951, 963 (1999), P99, 407 RIA Memo TC, pp. 2562-2563. Whether and how the
opinion thus adopted deviates from the special trial judge's original report is
never made public.

1 Unlike other judicial and administrative bodies, the Tax Court does not
maintain a formal practice of publicly disclosing proposed amendments to its
Rules.  See  Estate of Kanter v. Commissioner, 337 F.3d 833, 877-878, n. 2 (CA7
2003) (Cudahy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (describing the
Tax Court's lack of a ""formal documented procedure"" for amending its Rules as
""oddly out of sync with prevailing practices in other areas of the law"").
Although the Tax Court solicits comments on proposed rule changes from the
American Bar Association's Section on Taxation, see ABA Members Suggest
Modifications to Proposed Amendments of Tax Court Rules, 97 Tax Notes Today, p
167-25 (Aug. 28, 1997), the court apparently does not publish its proposals to,
or accept comments from, the general public.

 [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]  Petitioners are taxpayers who were unsuccessful in
the Tax Court and on appeal.  They object to the concealment of the special
trial judge's initial report and, in particular, exclusion of the report from
the record on appeal.  They urge that, under the Tax Court's current practice,
the parties and the Court of Appeals  [***236]  lack essential information: One
cannot tell whether, as Rule 183(c) requires, the final decision reflects ""[d]ue
regard"" for the special trial judge's ""opportunity to evaluate the credibility
of [the] witnesses,"" and presumes the correctness of that judge's initial
factfindings.  We agree that no statute authorizes, and the current text of Rule
183 does not warrant, the concealment at issue.  We so hold, mindful that it is
routine in federal judicial and administrative decisionmaking both to disclose
the initial report of a hearing officer, and to make that report part of the
record available to an appellate forum.  A departure of the bold character
practiced by the Tax Court--the creation and attribution solely to the special
trial judge of a superseding report composed in unrevealed collaboration with a
regular  [*47]  Tax Court judge--demands, at the very least, full and fair
statement in the Tax Court's own Rules. 2

Kanter (i) (asking whether Tax Court Rule 183 requires Tax Court judges to
uphold findings made by special trial judges unless ""clearly erroneous""
(internal quotation marks omitted)).  The meaning of Rule 183, however, is a
question anterior to all other questions the parties raised, and the
requirements of the Rule were indeed aired in the taxpayers' briefs.  See id.,
at 34-39; Reply Brief for Petitioner Ballard 2-3, 8-10; Reply Brief for
Petitioner Kanter 3-8.  Under the circumstances, we think it evident that our
disposition is in entire accord with ""our own Rule."" Compare post, at 68, 125 S.

After repeated Internal Revenue Service audits spanning several years, taxpayers
Claude Ballard, Burton W. Kanter, and Robert Lisle received multiple notices of
deficiency from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner). 3 The
Commissioner charged that during the 1970's and 1980's, Ballard and Lisle, real
estate executives at the Prudential Life Insurance Company of America
(Prudential), had an arrangement with Kanter, a tax lawyer and business
entrepreneur, under which people seeking to do business with Prudential made
payments to corporations controlled by  [*48]  Kanter.  Those payments, the
Commissioner alleged, were then distributed to Kanter, Ballard, and Lisle, or to
entities they controlled.  Ballard, Kanter, and Lisle did not report the
payments on their individual tax returns.  See  Investment Research Assoc., 78
TCM, at 1058, P99, 407 RIA Memo TC, pp 2672-2673;  Ballard v. Comm'r, 321 F.3d
1037, 1038-1039 (CA11 2003); Brief for Petitioner Ballard 3-4; Brief for
Petitioner Kanter 11.  After the initial deficiency notices, the Commissioner,
in 1994, additionally charged that  [***237]  the taxpayers' actions were
fraudulent.  See  Investment Research Assoc., 78 TCM, at 966, P99, 407  RIA Memo
TC, p 2693.  As to each asserted deficiency, Ballard, Kanter, and Lisle filed
petitions for redetermination in the Tax Court.  See  Ballard, 321 F.3d, at 1040

 [HN4] The Tax Court is composed of 19 regular judges appointed by the President
for 15-year terms, and several special trial judges appointed, from time to
time, by the Tax Court's Chief Judge.  See 26 U.S.C. §§ 7443(a)-(b), (e),
7443A(a) [26 USCS §§ 7443(a)-(b), (e), 7443A(a)]. 4 The statute governing the
appointment and competence of special trial judges, § 7443A, 5 prescribes no
term of office for them, but sets their salaries at 90% of the salary paid to
regular judges of the Tax Court, see § 7443A(d).  The Tax Court may authorize
special trial judges to hear and render final decisions in declaratory judgment
proceedings, ""small tax cases,"" and levy and lien proceedings.  See §
7443A(b)(1)-(4), (c); Tax Ct Rule 182, 26 USC App, p 1619 [USCS Court Rules, Tax
Court Rules, Rule 182]; Brief for Respondent 3.  If the amount of the taxes at
issue exceeds $50,000, a special trial judge may be assigned  [*49]  to preside
over the trial and issue a report containing recommended factfindings and
conclusions as to the taxpayers' liability, but decisional authority is [**1277]
reserved for the Tax Court.  See § 7443A(b)(5), (c);  Freytag v. Commissioner,
501 U.S. 868, 881-882, 115 L. Ed. 2d 764, 111 S. Ct. 2631 (1991) (noting that
special trial judges ""take testimony, conduct trials, [and] rule on the
admissibility of evidence,"" but ""lack authority to enter a final decision"" in
certain cases).  Tax Court Rule 183 governs the Tax Court's review of the
special trial judge's findings and opinion.  See  supra, at 44-45,161 L. Ed. 2d,
at 234-235.

4 Special trial judges were called ""commissioners"" when the office was created
in 1943.  The Tax Court changed the title to ""special trial judge"" in 1979.  See
Tax Ct Rule 182 note,  71 T.C. 1215 (1979); Brief for Petitioner Kanter 6.

5 Section 7443A was amended and renumbered in 1998, some years after the 1994
trial in these cases.  See Pub L 105-206, § 3401(c), 112 Stat 749.  The
alterations did not change the statute's text in any relevant respect.  This
opinion refers to the current version of the statute.

After Ballard, Kanter, and Lisle sought review in the Tax Court, the Chief Judge
assigned the consolidated case to Special Trial Judge D. Irvin Couvillion for
trial.  Judge Couvillion presided over a five-week trial during the summer of
1994, and the parties' briefing was completed in May 1995.  App. 7; see also
Ballard, 321 F.3d, at 1040.  The post-trial proceedings in the case are not
fully memorialized in either the Tax Court's docket records or its published
orders, but certain salient events can be traced.  On or before September 2,
1998, Judge Couvillion submitted to the Chief Judge a report containing his
findings of fact and opinion, ""as required by [Tax Court] Rule 183(b)."" Order of
Dec. 15, 1999, in No. 43966-85 etc. (TC), App. to Kanter Pet. for Cert.
113a-114a.  On September 2, 1998, the Chief Judge assigned the case to Tax Court
Judge Howard A. Dawson, Jr., ""for review [of the special trial judge's report]
and, if approved, for adoption."" Id., at 114a. 6 Fifteen  [***238]  months
later, on December 15, 1999, the Chief Judge ""reassigned"" the case ""from [Judge]
Couvillion to [Judge] Dawson."" Id.,  [*50]  at 113a.  That same day, Judge
Dawson issued the decision of the Tax Court.

6 Judge Dawson is a retired Tax Court judge who served two terms, from 1962
until 1985, as a regular member of the court.  He was recalled to judicial
duties by the Chief Judge of the Tax Court in 1990.  See 26 U.S.C. § 7447(c) [26
USCS § 7447(c)].  Recalled judges serve ""for any period . . . specified by the
chief judge."" Ibid. Their salary, unlike that of special trial judges, see
supra, at 48, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 237, is equal to that of Tax Court judges.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Judge Dawson found that Ballard, Kanter, and Lisle had acted with intent to
deceive the Commissioner, and held them liable for underpaid taxes and
substantial fraud penalties.  See, e.g. ,  Investment Research Assoc., 78 TCM,
at 1071, 1075, 1085, P99,407 RIA Memo TC, pp 2689, 2692-2693, 2705-2706.  In so
ruling, Judge Dawson purported to adopt the findings contained in the report
submitted by Judge Couvillion: ""The Court agrees with and adopts the opinion of
the Special Trial Judge, which is set forth below.""  Id., at 963, P99,407 RIA
Memo TC, pp 2562-2563.  Judge Dawson's decision consists in its entirety of a
document, over 600 pages in length, labeled ""Opinion of the Special Trial
Judge."" Ibid.

The taxpayers came to believe that the document titled ""Opinion of the Special
Trial Judge"" was not in fact a reproduction of Judge Couvillion's Rule 183(b)
report.  A declaration, dated August 21, 2000, submitted by Kanter's attorney,
Randall G. Dick, accounts for this belief.  Dick attested to conversations with
two Tax Court judges regarding the Tax Court's decision.  According to the
declaration, the judges told Dick that in the Rule 183(b) report submitted to
the Chief Judge, Judge Couvillion had concluded that Ballard, Kanter, and Lisle
did not owe taxes with respect to payments made by certain individuals seeking
to do business with Prudential,  and that the fraud penalty was not applicable.
App. to Ballard Pet. for Cert. 308a-309a, P 4.  Attorney Dick's declaration
further stated:


     ""In my conversations with the judges of the Tax Court, I was told the
     following: That substantial sections of the opinion [**1278]  were not
     written by Judge Couvillion, and that those sections containing
     findings related to the credibility of witnesses and findings related
     to fraud were wholly contrary to the findings made by Judge Couvillion
     in his report.  The changes to Judge Couvillion's  [*51]  findings
     relating to credibility and fraud were made by Judge Dawson."" Id. at
     309a, P 5.



Concerned that Judge Dawson had modified or rejected special trial judge
findings tending in their favor, see Tax Ct Rule 183(c), the taxpayers filed
three successive motions in the Tax Court; each motion sought access to the
report Special Trial Judge Couvillion had submitted to the Chief Judge or, in
the alternative, permission to place the special trial judge's report under seal
in the record on appeal.  See Order of Aug. 30, 2000, App. to Kanter Pet. for
Cert. 99a-101a; Motion of May 25, 2000,  id., at 105a.  The Tax Court denied the
motions.  See Order of Aug. 30, 2000, cf., id., at 100a-101a, 103a.  In response
to the taxpayers' third motion, filed in August 2000, the Tax Court elaborated:
""Judge Dawson states and Special Trial Judge Couvillion agrees, that, after a
meticulous and time-consuming  [***239]  review of the complex record in these
cases, Judge Dawson adopted the findings of fact and opinion of Special Trial
Judge Couvillion, . . . Judge Dawson presumed the findings of fact recommended
by Special Trial Judge Couvillion were correct, and . . . Judge Dawson gave due
regard"" to Judge Couvillion's credibility findings.  Id., at 102a.  To the
extent that the taxpayers sought ""any preliminary drafts"" of the special trial
judge's report, the Tax Court added, such documents are ""not subject to
production because they relate to the internal deliberative processes of the
Court."" Id., at 101a (quoting Order of Apr. 26, 2000, id., at 109a).

[HN5] Appeals from Tax Court decisions are taken to the court of appeals for the
circuit in which the taxpayer resides.  26 U.S.C. § 7482(b)(1)(A) [26 USCS §
7482(b)(1)(A)].  Ballard therefore appealed to the Eleventh Circuit, Kanter to
the Seventh Circuit, and Lisle to the Fifth Circuit.  All three Courts of
Appeals accepted the Commissioner's argument that the special trial judge's
signature on the Tax Court's final decision rendered that decision in fact
Special Trial Judge Couvillion's report.   Estate of Kanter v. Commissioner, 337
F.3d 833, 840-841 (CA7 2003);  [*52]   Ballard, 321 F.3d, at 1042; accord
Estate of Lisle v. Commissioner, 341 F.3d 364, 384 (CA5 2003) (adopting the
reasoning of the Seventh and Eleventh Circuits without elaboration).  The
appeals courts further agreed with the Commissioner that the special trial
judge's original report, submitted to the Chief Judge pursuant to Rule 183(b),
qualified as a confidential document, shielded as part of the Tax Court's
internal deliberative process.  See  Kanter, 337 F.3d, at 841-844;  Ballard, 321
F.3d, at 1042-1043; accord  Estate of Lisle, 341 F.3d, at 384.

Having rejected the taxpayers' objection to the absence of the special trial
judge's Rule 183(b) report from the record on appeal, the Seventh and Eleventh
Circuits proceeded to the merits of the Tax Court's final decision and affirmed
that decision in principal part.  See  Kanter, 337 F.3d, at 873-874;  Ballard,
321 F.3d, at 1044. 7 The Fifth Circuit's judgment, which is not before this
Court, reversed the fraud penalties assessed against Lisle for evidentiary
insufficiency but upheld the Tax Court's determination of tax deficiencies for
certain [**1279]  years.  See  Estate of Lisle, 341 F.3d, at 384-385. 8 Seventh
Circuit Judge Cudahy dissented on the issue of the special trial judge's initial
report, maintaining that intelligent review of the Tax Court's decision required
inclusion of that report in the record on appeal.  See  Kanter, 337 F.3d, at

[***LEdHR1A]  Central to these cases is Tax Court Rule 183, which delineates the
procedural framework and substantive standards governing Tax Court review of
special trial judge findings.  Rule 183(b), captioned ""Special Trial Judge's
Report,"" provides that after the trial of a case and submission of the parties'
briefs, ""the Special Trial Judge shall submit a report, including findings of
fact and opinion, to the Chief Judge, and the Chief Judge will assign the case
to a Judge . . . of the Court."" 26 USC App, p 1619 [USCS Court Rules, Tax Court
Rules, Rule 183]. 9  [HN6] Rule 183(c), directed to the Tax Court judge to whom
the case is assigned for final decision, reads:

9 Rule 183 has been amended since these cases were before the Tax Court, but the
substantive provisions of the Rule have not been altered in any relevant
respect.  Compare Tax Ct Rule 183, 26 USC App, p 1483 (1994 ed.) [USCS Court
Rules, Tax Court Rules, Rule 183], with Tax Ct Rule 183 (interim amendment), 26
USC App, p 1670 (2000 ed.) [USCS Court Rules, Tax Court Rules, Rule 183].

     ""Action on the Report: The Judge to whom . . . the case is assigned
     may adopt the Special Trial Judge's report or may modify it or may
     reject it in whole or in part, or may direct the filing of additional
     briefs or may receive further evidence or may direct oral argument, or
     may recommit the report with instructions.  Due regard shall be given
     to the circumstance that the Special Trial Judge had the opportunity
     to evaluate the credibility of witnesses, and the findings of fact
     recommended by the Special Trial Judge shall be presumed to be
     correct.""



The Tax Court judge assigned to take action on the special trial judge's report
in these cases invoked none of the means Rule 183(c) provides to supplement the
record.  He did not ""direct the filing of additional briefs[,] receive further
evidence or . . . direct oral argument."" See ibid. Nor does the record show, or
the Commissioner contend, see Brief for Respondent 14-15, that the Tax Court
judge ""recommit[ed]  [*54]  the [special trial judge's] report with
instructions."" Rule 183(c). 10 From [**1280]  all that appears on the record,
then, Judge Dawson's review of the factfindings contained in Judge Couvillion's
report  [***241]  rested on the Rule 183(b) report itself, the trial transcript,
and the other documents on file.  Rule 183(c) guides the appraisal of those
filed materials.

10 The record does contain an order stating in its entirety:

""For cause, it is ORDERED: That these cases are reassigned from Special Trial
Judge D. Irvin Couvillion to Judge Howard A. Dawson, Jr., for disposition.

""After the Special Trial Judge submitted a report, as required by Rule 183(b),
Tax Court Rules of Practice and Procedure, these cases were referred to Judge
Dawson on September 2, 1998, for review and, if approved, for adoption.


     * * * * *



""Dated: Washington, D. C. December 15, 1999."" App. to Kanter Pet. for Cert.
113a-114a.

One might speculate, from the reference to a ""reassign[ment],"" that at some
point between September 1998 and December 1999, Judge Dawson ""recommitted"" the
report to Judge Couvillion, who subsequently submitted a revised report to the
Chief Judge who, in turn, referred that report to Judge Dawson.  The
Commissioner does not urge such an interpretation of the December 15, 1999
order, however, and it is, in any event, implausible.  The Tax Court's docket
reveals no action taken between the initial assignment and the enigmatic
reassignment.  Had Judge Dawson turned back the report after first receiving it,
an order recommitting the case to Judge Couvillion ""with instructions,"" Rule
183(c), should have memorialized that action.  Moreover, Judge Dawson rendered
the final decision of the Tax Court on the same day the case was ""reassigned"" to
him.  Had he faced a recast Rule 183(b) report, it is doubtful that he could
have absorbed and acted upon it so swiftly.

 Rule 183(c)'s origin confirms the clear understanding, from the start, that
deference is due to factfindings made by the trial judge.  Commenting in 1973 on
then newly adopted Rule 182(d), the precursor to Rule 183(c), the Tax Court
observed that the Rule was modeled on Rule 147(b) of the former Court of Claims.
Tax Ct Rule 182 note,  60 T.C. 1150 (Tax Court review procedures were to be
""comparable"" to those used in the Court of Claims).  Rule 182(d)'s ""[d]ue  [*55]
regard"" and ""presumed to be correct"" formulations were taken directly from that
earlier Rule, 11 which the Court of Claims interpreted to require respectful
attention to the trial judge's findings of fact. See  Hebah v. United States,
456 F.2d 696, 698, 197 Ct. Cl. 729 (Ct. Cl. 1972) (per curiam) (challenger must
make ""a strong affirmative showing"" to overcome the presumption of correctness
that attaches to trial judge findings).  The Tax Court's acknowledgment of Court
of Claims Rule 147(b) as the model for its own Rule, indeed the Tax Court's
adoption of nearly identical language, lead to the conclusion the Tax Court
itself expressed: Under the Rule formerly designated Rule 182(b), now designated
183(c), special trial judge findings carry ""special weight insofar as those
findings are determined by the opportunity to hear and observe the witnesses.""
Tax Ct Rule 182 note,  60 T.C. 1150 (1973); see  Stone v. Commissioner, 275 U.S.
App. D.C. 123, 865 F.2d 342, 345 (CADC 1989).

11 Court of Claims Rule 147(b) provided:

""The court may adopt the [trial judge's] report, including conclusions of fact
and law, or may modify it, or reject it in whole or in part, or direct the
[trial judge] to receive further evidence, or refer the case back to him with
instructions.  Due regard shall be given to the circumstance that the [trial
judge] had the opportunity to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses; and the
findings of fact made by the [trial judge] shall be presumed to be correct."" 28

Under Rule 182 as it was formulated in 1973, the Tax Court's review of the
special trial judge's report was a transparent process.  Rule 182(b) provided
for service of copies of the special trial judge's report on the parties and
Rule 182(c) allowed parties to file exceptions to the report.   60 T.C., at 1149
.  The process resembled a district court's review of a magistrate judge's
report and recommendation: The regular Tax Court judge reviewed the special
trial judge's report independently, on the basis of the record and the parties'
objections to the report.  See Rule 182(c), (d),  id., at 1149-1150.  In years
before 1984, the Tax Court acknowledged [*56]  instances in which it
""disagree[d] with the Special Trial Judge,"" see  Rosenbaum v. Commissioner, 45
TCM 825, 827 (1983), P83,113 P-H Memo TC, p 373, or modified the special trial
judge's findings, see  Taylor v. Commissioner, 41 TCM 539 (1980), P80,552 P-H
Memo TC, p 2344 (adopting special trial judge's report with ""some
modifications"").  Parties were [**1281]  therefore equipped to argue to an
appellate court that the Tax Court failed to give the special trial judge's
findings the measure of respect required by Rule 182(d)'s ""[d]ue regard"" and
""presumed to be correct"" formulations.

In 1983, the Tax Court amended the Rule, which it simultaneously  [***242]
renumbered as Rule 183.  The 1983 change eliminated the provision, formerly in
Rule 182(b), for service of copies of the special trial judge's report on the
parties; it also eliminated the procedure, formerly in Rule 182(c), permitting
the parties to file exceptions to the report.  See Rule 183 note,  81 T.C., at
1069-1070.  The Tax Court left intact, however, the Rule's call for ""[d]ue
regard"" to the special trial judge's credibility determinations and the
instruction that ""the findings of fact recommended by the Special Trial Judge
shall be presumed to be correct."" Rule 183(c),  id., at 1069.  Further, the 1983
amendments did not purport to change the character of the action the Tax Court
judge could take on the special trial judge's report; as before, the Tax Court
could ""adopt"" the report, ""modify it,"" or ""reject it in whole or in part."" Ibid.
In practice, however, the Tax Court stopped acknowledging instances in which it
rejected or modified special trial judge findings.  Judge Cudahy, in dissent in
the Seventh Circuit, commented on the ""extraordinary unanimity"" that has
prevailed since the 1983 amendments: ""Never, in any instance since the adoption
of the current Rule 183 that I could find,"" Judge Cudahy reported, ""has a Tax
Court judge not agreed with and adopted the [special trial judge's] opinion.""
Kanter, 337 F.3d, at 876; cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 44 (Counsel for the Commissioner,
in response  [*57]  to the Court's question, stated: ""We're not aware of any
cases in which the Tax Court judge has rejected the [special trial judge's]
findings . . . ."").

[***LEdHR1A]  It appears from these cases and from the Commissioner's
representations to this Court that the Tax Court, following the 1983 amendments
to Rule 183, inaugurated a novel practice regarding the report the special trial
judge submits post-trial to the Chief Judge.  No longer does the Tax Court judge
assigned to the case alone review the report and issue a decision adopting it,
modifying it, or rejecting it in whole or in part.  Instead, the Tax Court judge
treats the special trial judge's report essentially as an "

 [*555]  [**1187]   Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A]  This case requires us to address, for the second time in a decade
and a half, whether it is permissible under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments
to the Constitution of the United States to execute a juvenile offender who was
older  [*556]  than 15 but younger than 18 when he committed a capital crime.
In  Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U.S. 361, 106 L. Ed. 2d 306, 109 S. Ct. 2969
(1989), a divided Court rejected the proposition that the Constitution bars
capital punishment for juvenile offenders in this age group.  We reconsider the
question.

I

At the age of 17, when he was still a junior in high school, Christopher
Simmons, the respondent here, committed murder. About nine months later, after
he had turned 18, he was tried and sentenced to death.  There is little doubt
that Simmons was the instigator of the crime.  Before its commission Simmons
said he wanted to murder someone.  In chilling, callous terms he talked about
his plan, discussing it for the most part with two friends, Charles Benjamin and
John Tessmer, then aged 15 and 16 respectively.  Simmons proposed to commit
burglary and murder by breaking and entering, tying up a victim, and throwing
the victim off a bridge.  Simmons assured his friends they could ""get away with
it"" because they were minors.

The three met at about 2 a.m. on the night of the murder, but Tessmer left
before the other two set out.  (The State later charged Tessmer with conspiracy,
but dropped the charge in exchange for his testimony against Simmons.) Simmons
and Benjamin entered the home of the victim, Shirley Crook, after reaching
through an open window and unlocking the [**1188]  back door.  Simmons turned on
a hallway light.  Awakened, Mrs. Crook called out, ""Who's there?"" In response
Simmons entered Mrs. Crook's bedroom, where he recognized her from a previous
car accident involving them both.  Simmons later admitted this confirmed his
resolve to murder her.

Using duct tape to cover her eyes and mouth and bind her hands, the two
perpetrators put Mrs. Crook in her minivan and drove to a state park.  They
reinforced the bindings, covered her head with a towel, and walked her to a
railroad  [*557]  trestle spanning the Meramec River.  There they tied her hands
and feet together with electrical wire, wrapped her whole face in duct tape and
threw her from the bridge, drowning her in the waters below.

By the afternoon of September 9, Steven Crook had returned home from an
overnight trip, found his bedroom in disarray, and reported his wife missing.
On the same afternoon  [***14]  fishermen recovered the victim's body from the
river.  Simmons, meanwhile, was bragging about the killing, telling friends he
had killed a woman ""because the bitch seen my face.""

The next day, after receiving information of Simmons' involvement, police
arrested him at his high school and took him to the police station in Fenton,
Missouri.  They read him his Miranda rights.  Simmons waived his right to an
attorney and agreed to answer questions.  After less than two hours of
interrogation, Simmons confessed to the murder and agreed to perform a
videotaped reenactment at the crime scene.

The State charged Simmons with burglary, kidnaping, stealing, and murder in the
first degree.  As Simmons was 17 at the time of the crime, he was outside the
criminal jurisdiction of Missouri's juvenile court system.  See Mo. Rev. Stat.
§§ 211.021 (2000) and 211.031 (Supp. 2003).  He was tried as an adult. At trial
the State introduced Simmons' confession and the videotaped reenactment of the
crime, along with testimony that Simmons discussed the crime in advance and
bragged about it later.  The defense called no witnesses in the guilt phase.
The jury having returned a verdict of murder, the trial proceeded to the penalty
phase.

The State sought the death penalty. As aggravating factors, the State submitted
that the murder was committed for the purpose of receiving money; was committed
for the purpose of avoiding, interfering with, or preventing lawful arrest of
the defendant; and involved depravity of mind and was outrageously and wantonly
vile, horrible, and inhuman.   [*558]  The State called Shirley Crook's husband,
daughter, and two sisters, who presented moving evidence of the devastation her
death had brought to their lives.

In mitigation Simmons' attorneys first called an officer of the Missouri
juvenile justice system, who testified that Simmons had no prior convictions and
that no previous charges had been filed against him.  Simmons' mother, father,
two younger half brothers, a neighbor, and a friend took the stand to tell the
jurors of the close relationships they had formed with Simmons and to plead for
mercy on his behalf.  Simmons' mother, in particular, testified to the
responsibility Simmons demonstrated in taking care of his two younger half
brothers and of his grandmother and to his capacity to show love for them.

During closing arguments, both the prosecutor and defense counsel addressed
Simmons' age, which the trial judge had instructed the jurors they could
consider as a mitigating factor.  Defense counsel reminded the jurors that
juveniles of Simmons' age cannot drink, serve on juries, or even see certain
movies, because ""the legislatures [**1189]  have wisely decided that individuals
of a certain age aren't responsible enough."" Defense counsel argued that
Simmons' age should make ""a huge difference to [the jurors] in deciding just
exactly what sort of punishment to make."" In rebuttal, the prosecutor gave the
following response: ""Age, he says.  Think about age.  Seventeen years old.
Isn't that scary?  Doesn't that scare you?  Mitigating? Quite the contrary I
submit.  Quite the contrary.""

The jury recommended the death penalty after finding the State had  [***15]
proved each of the three aggravating factors submitted to it.  Accepting the
jury's recommendation, the trial judge imposed the death penalty.

Simmons obtained new counsel, who moved in the trial court to set aside the
conviction and sentence. One argument was that Simmons had received ineffective
assistance at trial.  To support this contention, the new counsel called  [*559]
as witnesses Simmons' trial attorney, Simmons' friends and neighbors, and
clinical psychologists who had evaluated him.

Part of the submission was that Simmons was ""very immature,"" ""very impulsive,""
and ""very susceptible to being manipulated or influenced."" The experts testified
about Simmons' background including a difficult home environment and dramatic
changes in behavior, accompanied by poor school performance in adolescence.
Simmons was absent from home for long periods, spending time using alcohol and
drugs with other teenagers or young adults. The contention by Simmons'
postconviction counsel was that these matters should have been established in
the sentencing proceeding.

The trial court found no constitutional violation by reason of ineffective
assistance of counsel and denied the motion for postconviction relief.  In a
consolidated appeal from Simmons' conviction and sentence, and from the denial
of postconviction relief, the Missouri Supreme Court affirmed.   State v.
Simmons, 944 S.W.2d 165, 169 (en banc), cert denied,  522 U.S. 953, 139 L. Ed.
2d 293, 118 S. Ct. 376 (1997).  The federal courts denied Simmons' petition for
a writ of habeas corpus.   Simmons v. Bowersox, 235 F.3d 1124, 1127 (CA8), cert
denied,  534 U.S. 924, 151 L. Ed. 2d 206, 122 S. Ct. 280 (2001).

After these proceedings in Simmons' case had run their course, this Court held
that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the execution of a mentally
retarded person.   Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335, 122 S.
Ct. 2242 (2002).  Simmons filed a new petition for state postconviction relief,
arguing that the reasoning of Atkins established that the Constitution prohibits
the execution of a juvenile who was under 18 when the crime was committed.

The Missouri Supreme Court agreed.   State ex rel. Simmons v. Roper, 112 S.W.3d
397 (2003) (en banc).  It held that since Stanford,


     ""a national consensus has developed against the execution of juvenile
     offenders, as demonstrated by the fact that eighteen states now bar
     such executions for juveniles,  [*560]  that twelve other states bar
     executions altogether, that no state has lowered its age of execution
     below 18 since Stanford, that five states have legislatively or by
     case law raised or established the minimum age at 18, and that the
     imposition of the juvenile death penalty has become truly unusual over
     the last decade.""  112 S.W.3d, at 399.



On this reasoning it set aside Simmons' death sentence and resentenced him to
""life imprisonment without eligibility for probation, parole, or release except
by act of the Governor.""  Id., at 413.

[**1190]  We granted certiorari,  540 U.S. 1160, 157 L. Ed. 2d 1204, 124 S. Ct.
1171 (2004), and now affirm.

II

[***LEdHR2] [2]  [***LEdHR3A]  The Eighth Amendment provides:  [HN1]  [***16]
""Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel
and unusual punishments inflicted.""  [HN2] The provision is applicable to the
States through the Fourteenth Amendment.   Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 239,
33 L. Ed. 2d 346, 92 S. Ct. 2726 (1972) (per curiam);  Robinson v. California,
370 U.S. 660, 666-667, 8 L. Ed. 2d 758, 82 S. Ct. 1417 (1962);   Louisiana ex
rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459, 463, 91 L. Ed. 422, 67 S. Ct. 374 (1947)
(plurality opinion).  As the Court explained in Atkins, [HN3]  the Eighth
Amendment guarantees individuals the right not to be subjected to excessive
sanctions.  The right flows from the basic ""'precept of justice that punishment
for crime should be graduated and proportioned to [the] offense.'""  536 U.S., at
311, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335, 122 S. Ct. 2242 (quoting  Weems v. United States, 217
U.S. 349, 367, 54 L. Ed. 793, 30 S. Ct. 544 (1910)).  By protecting even those
convicted of heinous crimes, the Eighth Amendment reaffirms the duty of the
government to respect the dignity of all persons.

[***LEdHR3A]    [HN4] The prohibition against ""cruel and unusual punishments,""
like other expansive language in the Constitution, must be interpreted according
to its text, by considering history, tradition, and precedent, and with due
regard for its purpose and function in the constitutional design.  To implement
this  [*561]  framework we have established the propriety and affirmed the
necessity of referring to ""the evolving standards of decency that mark the
progress of a maturing society""  to determine which punishments are so
disproportionate as to be cruel and unusual.   Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86,
100-101, 2 L. Ed. 2d 630, 78 S. Ct. 590 (1958) (plurality opinion).

In  Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815, 101 L. Ed. 2d 702, 108 S. Ct. 2687
(1988), a plurality of the Court determined that our standards of decency do not
permit the execution of any offender under the age of 16 at the time of the
crime.   Id., at 818-838, 101 L. Ed. 2d 702, 108 S. Ct. 2687 (opinion of
Stevens, J., joined by Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ.).  The plurality
opinion explained that no death penalty State that had given express
consideration to a minimum age for the death penalty had set the age lower than
16.   Id., at 826-829, 101 L. Ed. 2d 702, 108 S. Ct. 2687.  The plurality also
observed that ""[t]he conclusion that it would offend civilized standards of
decency to execute a person who was less than 16 years old at the time of his or
her offense is consistent with the views that have been expressed by respected
professional organizations, by other nations that share our Anglo-American
heritage, and by the leading members of the Western European community.  ""  Id.,
at 830, 101 L. Ed. 2d 702, 108 S. Ct. 2687.  The opinion further noted that
juries imposed the death penalty on offenders under 16 with exceeding rarity;
the last execution of an offender for a crime committed under the age of 16 had
been carried out in 1948, 40 years prior.   Id., at 832-833, 101 L. Ed. 2d 702,
108 S. Ct. 2687.

Bringing its independent judgment to bear on the permissibility of the death
penalty for a 15-year-old offender, the Thompson plurality stressed that ""[t]he
reasons why juveniles are not trusted with the privileges and responsibilities
of an adult also explain why their irresponsible conduct is not as morally
[***17]  reprehensible as that of an adult.""  Id., at 835, 101 L. Ed. 2d 702,
108 S. Ct. 2687.  According to the plurality, the lesser culpability of
offenders under 16 made the death penalty inappropriate as a form of
retribution, while the low likelihood that [**1191]  offenders under 16 engaged
in ""the kind of cost-benefit analysis that  [*562]  attaches any weight to the
possibility of execution"" made the death penalty ineffective as a means of
deterrence.   Id., at 836-838, 101 L. Ed. 2d 702, 108 S. Ct. 2687.  With Justice
O'Connor concurring in the judgment on narrower grounds,  id., at 848-859, 101
L. Ed. 2d 702, 108 S. Ct. 2687, the Court set aside the death sentence that had
been imposed on the 15-year-old offender.

The next year, in  Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U.S. 361, 106 L. Ed. 2d 306, 109 S.
Ct. 2969 (1989), the Court, over a dissenting opinion joined by four Justices,
referred to contemporary standards of decency in this country and concluded the
Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments did not proscribe the execution of juvenile
offenders over 15 but under 18.  The Court noted that 22 of the 37 death penalty
States permitted the death penalty for 16-year-old offenders, and, among these
37 States, 25 permitted it for 17-year-old offenders. These numbers, in the
Court's view, indicated there was no national consensus ""sufficient to label a
particular punishment cruel and unusual.""  Id., at 370-371, 106 L. Ed. 2d 306,
109 S. Ct. 2969.  A plurality of the Court also ""emphatically reject[ed]"" the
suggestion that the Court should bring its own judgment to bear on the
acceptability of the juvenile death penalty.   Id., at 377-378, 106 L. Ed. 2d
306, 109 S. Ct. 2969 (opinion of Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and
White and Kennedy, JJ.); see also  id., at 382, 106 L. Ed. 2d 306, 109 S. Ct.
2969 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (criticizing
the plurality's refusal ""to judge whether the '""nexus between the punishment
imposed and the defendant's blameworthiness""' is proportional"").

The same day the Court decided Stanford, it held that the Eighth Amendment did
not mandate a categorical exemption from the death penalty for the mentally
retarded.  Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 106 L. Ed. 2d 256, 109 S. Ct. 2934
(1989).  In reaching this conclusion it stressed that only two States had
enacted laws banning the imposition of the death penalty on a mentally retarded
person convicted of a capital offense.   Id., at 334, 106 L. Ed. 2d. 256, 109 S.
Ct. 2934.  According to the Court, ""the two state statutes prohibiting execution
of the mentally retarded, even when added to the 14 States that have rejected
capital punishment completely,  [*563]  [did] not provide sufficient evidence at
present of a national consensus."" Ibid.

Three Terms ago the subject was reconsidered in Atkins. We held that standards
of decency have evolved since Penry and now demonstrate that the execution of
the mentally retarded is cruel and unusual punishment.  The Court noted
objective indicia of society's standards, as expressed in legislative enactments
and state practice with respect to executions of the mentally retarded. When
Atkins was decided only a minority of States permitted the practice, and even in
those States it was rare.   536 U.S., at 314-315, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335, 122 S. Ct.
2242.  On the basis of these indicia the Court determined that executing
mentally retarded  [***18]  offenders ""has become truly unusual, and it is fair
to say that a national consensus has developed against it.""  Id., at 316, 153 L.
Ed. 2d 335, 122 S. Ct. 2242.

The inquiry into our society's evolving standards of decency did not end there.
The Atkins Court neither repeated nor relied upon the statement in Stanford that
the Court's independent judgment has no bearing on the acceptability of a
particular punishment under the Eighth Amendment.  Instead we returned to the
rule, established in decisions predating Stanford,  that ""'the Constitution
contemplates that in the end our own judgment will be brought to bear on the
question of the acceptability of the death penalty under the Eighth Amendment.'""
[**1192]   536 U.S., at 312, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335, 122 S. Ct. 2242 (quoting  Coker
v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584, 597, 53 L. Ed. 2d 982, 97 S. Ct. 2861 (1977)
(plurality opinion)).  Mental retardation, the Court said, diminishes personal
culpability even if the offender can distinguish right from wrong.   536 U.S.,
at 318, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335, 122 S. Ct. 2242.  The impairments of mentally
retarded offenders make it less defensible to impose the death penalty as
retribution for past crimes and less likely that the death penalty will have a
real deterrent effect.   Id., at 319-320, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335, 122 S. Ct. 2242.
Based on these considerations and on the finding of national consensus against
executing the mentally retarded, the Court ruled that the death penalty
constitutes an excessive sanction for the entire category of mentally retarded
offenders,  [*564]  and that the Eighth Amendment ""'places a substantive
restriction on the State's power to take the life' of a mentally retarded
offender.""  Id., at 321, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335, 122 S. Ct. 2242 (quoting  Ford v.
Wainwright, 477 U.S. 399, 405, 91 L. Ed. 2d 335, 106 S. Ct. 2595 (1986)).

Just as the Atkins Court reconsidered the issue decided in Penry, we now
reconsider the issue decided in Stanford. The beginning point is a review of
objective indicia of consensus, as expressed in particular by the enactments of
legislatures that have addressed the question.  These data give us essential
instruction.  We then must determine, in the exercise of our own independent
judgment, whether the death penalty is a disproportionate punishment for
juveniles.

A

[***LEdHR1A]  The evidence of national consensus against the death penalty for
juveniles is similar, and in some respects parallel, to the evidence Atkins held
sufficient to demonstrate a national consensus against the death penalty for the
mentally retarded. When Atkins was decided, 30 States prohibited the death
penalty for the mentally retarded. This number comprised 12 that had abandoned
the death penalty altogether, and 18 that maintained it but excluded the
mentally retarded from its reach.    536 U.S., at 313-315, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335,
122 S. Ct. 2242. By a similar calculation in this case, 30 States prohibit the
juvenile death penalty, comprising 12 that have rejected the death penalty
altogether and 18 that maintain it but, by express provision or judicial
interpretation, exclude juveniles from its reach.  See Appendix A, infra.
Atkins emphasized that even in the 20 States without formal prohibition, the
practice of executing the  [***19]  mentally retarded was infrequent.  Since
Penry, only five States had executed offenders known to have an IQ under 70.
536 U.S., at 316, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335, 122 S. Ct. 2242.  In the present case, too,
even in the 20 States without a formal prohibition on executing juveniles, the
practice is infrequent.  Since Stanford, six States have executed prisoners for
crimes committed as juveniles.  [*565]  In the past 10 years, only three have
done so: Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia.  See V. Streib, The Juvenile Death
Penalty Today: Death Sentences and Executions for Juvenile Crimes, January 1,
1973-December 31, 2004, No. 76, p 4 (2005), available at
http://www.law.onu.edu/faculty/streib/documents/JuvDeathDec2004.pdf (last
updated Jan. 31, 2005) (as visited Feb. 25, 2005, and available in Clerk of
Court's case file).  In December 2003 the Governor of Kentucky decided to spare
the life of Kevin Stanford, and commuted his sentence to one of life
imprisonment without parole, with the declaration that ""'[w]e ought not be
executing people who, legally, were children.'"" Lexington Herald Leader, Dec. 9,
2003, p B3, 2003 WL 65043346. By this act the Governor ensured Kentucky would
not add itself to the list of [**1193]  States that have executed juveniles
within the last 10 years even by the execution of the very defendant whose death
sentence the Court had upheld in Stanford v Kentucky.

There is, to be sure, at least one difference between the evidence of consensus
in Atkins and in this case.  Impressive in Atkins was the rate of abolition of
the death penalty for the mentally retarded. Sixteen States that permitted the
execution of the mentally retarded at the time of Penry had prohibited the
practice by the time we heard Atkins. By contrast, the rate of change in
reducing the incidence of the juvenile death penalty, or in taking specific
steps to abolish it, has been slower.  Five States that allowed the juvenile
death penalty at the time of Stanford have abandoned it in the intervening 15
years--four through legislative enactments and one through judicial decision.
Streib, supra, at 5, 7;  State v. Furman, 122 Wn.2d 440, 858 P.2d 1092 (1993)
(en banc).

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR4] [4] Though less dramatic than the change from Penry
to Atkins (""telling,"" to borrow the word Atkins used to describe this
difference,  536 U.S., at 315, n. 18, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335, 122 S. Ct. 2242), we
still consider the change from Stanford to this case to be significant.  As
noted in Atkins, with respect to the States that had abandoned  [*566]  the
death penalty for the mentally retarded since Penry, ""[i]t is not so much the
number of these States that is significant, but the consistency of the direction
of change.""  536 U.S., at 315, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335, 122 S. Ct. 2242.  In
particular we found it significant that, in the wake of Penry, no State that had
already prohibited the execution of the mentally retarded had passed legislation
to reinstate the penalty.    536 U.S., at 315-316, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335, 122 S. Ct.
2242.  The number of States that have abandoned capital punishment for juvenile
offenders since Stanford is smaller than the number of States that abandoned
capital punishment for the mentally retarded after Penry; yet we think the same
consistency of direction of change has been demonstrated.  Since Stanford, no
State that previously prohibited capital punishment for juveniles has reinstated
it.  This fact,  [***20]  coupled with the trend toward abolition of the
juvenile death penalty, carries special force in light of the general popularity
of anticrime legislation,  Atkins, supra, at 315, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335, 122 S. Ct.
2242, and in light of the particular trend in recent years toward cracking down
on juvenile crime in other respects, see H. Snyder & M. Sickmund, National
Center for Juvenile Justice, Juvenile Offenders and Victims: 1999 National
Report 89, 133 (Sept. 1999); Scott & Grisso, The Evolution of Adolescence: A
Developmental Perspective on Juvenile Justice Reform, 88 J. Crim. L. & C. 137,
148 (1997).  Any difference between this case and Atkins with respect to the
pace of abolition is thus counterbalanced by the consistent direction of the
change.

The slower pace of abolition of the juvenile death penalty over the past 15
years, moreover, may have a simple explanation.  When we heard Penry, only two
death penalty States had already prohibited the execution of the mentally
retarded. When we heard Stanford, by contrast, 12 death penalty States had
already prohibited the execution of any juvenile under 18, and 15 had prohibited
the execution of any juvenile under 17.  If anything, this shows that the
impropriety of executing juveniles between 16 and 18 years of age  [*567]
gained wide recognition earlier than the impropriety of executing the mentally
retarded. In the words of the Missouri Supreme Court: ""It would be the ultimate
in irony if the very fact that the inappropriateness of the death penalty for
juveniles was broadly recognized sooner than it was recognized for the mentally
retarded were to become a reason to continue the execution  [**1194] of
juveniles now that the execution of the mentally retarded has been barred.""
112 S.W.3d, at 408, n. 10.

[***LEdHR1A]  Petitioner cannot show national consensus in favor of capital
punishment for juveniles but still resists the conclusion that any consensus
exists against it.  Petitioner supports this position with, in particular, the
observation that when the Senate ratified the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights (ICCPR), Dec. 19, 1966, 999 U. N. T. S. 171 (entered into
force Mar. 23, 1976), it did so subject to the President's proposed reservation
regarding Article 6(5) of that treaty, which prohibits capital punishment for
juveniles. Brief for Petitioner 27.  This reservation at best provides only
faint support for petitioner's argument.  First, the reservation was passed in
1992; since then, five States have abandoned capital punishment for juveniles.
Second, Congress considered the issue when enacting the Federal Death Penalty
Act in 1994, and determined that the death penalty should not extend to
juveniles. See 18 U.S.C. § 3591. The reservation to Article 6(5) of the ICCPR
provides minimal evidence that there is not now a national consensus against
juvenile executions.

As in Atkins, the objective indicia of consensus in this case--the rejection of
the juvenile death penalty in the majority of States; the infrequency of its use
even where it remains on the books; and the consistency in the trend toward
abolition of the practice--provide sufficient evidence that today our society
views juveniles, in the words Atkins used respecting the mentally retarded, as
""categorically less culpable than the  [***21]  average criminal.""  536 U.S., at
316, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335, 122 S. Ct. 2242.

[*568]  B

[HN5] A majority of States have rejected the imposition of the death penalty on
juvenile offenders under 18, and we now hold this is required by the Eighth
Amendment.

[***LEdHR5] [5] [***LEdHR6] [6] [***LEdHR7] [7] [***LEdHR8] [8]  [HN6] Because
the death penalty is the most severe punishment, the Eighth Amendment applies to
it with special force.   Thompson, 487 U.S., at 856, 101 L. Ed. 2d 702, 108 S.
Ct. 2687 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  Capital punishment must be
limited to those offenders who commit ""a narrow category of the most serious
crimes"" and whose extreme culpability makes them ""the most deserving of
execution.""   Atkins, supra, at 319, 153 L. Ed. 2d 335, 122 S. Ct. 2242.  This
principle is implemented throughout the capital sentencing process.  States must
give narrow and precise definition to the aggravating factors that can result in
a capital sentence.  Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U.S. 420, 428-429, 64 L. Ed. 2d
398, 100 S. Ct. 1759 (1980) (plurality opinion).  In any capital case a
defendant has wide latitude to raise as a mitigating factor ""any aspect of [his
or her] character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the
defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.""  Lockett v. Ohio,
438 U.S. 586, 604, 57 L. Ed. 2d 973, 98 S. Ct. 2954 (1978) (plurality opinion);
Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 110-112, 71 L. Ed. 2d 1, 102 S. Ct. 869
(1982); see also  Johnson v. Texas, 509 U.S. 350, 359-362, 125 L. Ed. 2d 290,
113 S. Ct. 2658 (1993) (summarizing the Court's jurisprudence after  Furman v.
Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 33 L. Ed. 2d 346, 92 S. Ct. 2726 (1972) (per curiam),
with respect to a sentencer's consideration of aggravating and mitigating
factors).  There are a number of crimes that beyond question are severe in
absolute terms, yet the death penalty may not be imposed for their commission.
Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584, 53 L. Ed. 2d 982, 97 S. Ct. 2861 (1977) (rape of
an adult woman);  Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S. 782, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1140, 102 S. Ct.
3368 (1982) (felony murder where [**1195]  defendant did not kill, attempt to
kill, or intend to kill).  The death penalty may not be imposed on certain
classes of offenders, such as juveniles under 16, the insane, and the mentally
retarded, no matter how heinous the crime.   Thompson v Oklahoma, supra;  Ford
v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 399, 91 L. Ed. 2d 335, 106 S. Ct. 2595 (1986);  Atkins,
supra.  These rules vindicate the underlying principle  [*569]  that the death
penalty is reserved for a narrow category of crimes and offenders.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR9A]  Three general differences between juveniles under
18 and adults demonstrate that juvenile offenders cannot with reliability be
classified among the worst offenders. First, as any parent knows and as the
scientific and sociological studies respondent and his amici cite tend to
confirm, ""[a] lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility are
found in youth more often than in adults and are more understandable among the
young.  These qualities often result in impetuous and ill-considered actions and
decisions.""  Johnson, supra, at 367, 125 L. Ed. 2d 290, 113 S. Ct. 2658; see
also  Eddings, supra, at 115-116, 71 L. Ed. 2d 1, 102 S. Ct. 869 (""Even the
normal 16-year-old customarily lacks the maturity of an adult"").  It has been
noted that ""adolescents are overrepresented  [***22]  statis"

 [*796]  [**2827]   Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A] This case requires us to consider whether, after we had denied
[***699]  certiorari and a petition for rehearing, the Court of Appeals had the
power to withhold its mandate for more than five months without entering a
formal order.  We hold that, even assuming a court may withhold its mandate
after the denial of certiorari in some cases, the Court of Appeals' decision to
do so here was an abuse of discretion.

In 1985, Gregory Thompson and Joanna McNamara abducted Brenda Blanton Lane from
a store parking lot in Shelbyville, Tennessee.  After forcing Lane to drive them
to a remote location, Thompson stabbed her to death.  Thompson offered [**2828]
no evidence during the guilt phase of trial and was convicted by a jury of
first-degree murder.

Thompson's defense attorneys concentrated their efforts on persuading the
sentencing jury that Thompson's positive [*797]  qualities and capacity to
adjust to prison life provided good reasons for not imposing the death penalty.
Before trial, Thompson's counsel had explored the issue of his mental condition.
The trial judge referred Thompson to a state-run mental health facility for a
30-day evaluation.  The resulting report indicated that Thompson was competent
at the time of the offense and at the time of the examination.  The defense team
retained their own expert, Dr. George Copple, a clinical psychologist.  At
sentencing Copple testified that Thompson was remorseful and still had the
ability to work and contribute while in prison. Thompson presented the character
testimony of a number of witnesses, including former high school teachers, his
grandparents, and two siblings.  Arlene Cajulao, Thompson's girlfriend while he
was stationed with the Navy in Hawaii, also testified on his behalf.  She
claimed that Thompson's behavior became erratic after he suffered head injuries
during an attack by three of his fellow servicemen.  In rebuttal the State
called Dr. Glenn Watson, a clinical psychologist who led the pretrial evaluation
of Thompson's competence.  Watson testified that his examination of Thompson
revealed no significant mental illness.

The jury sentenced Thompson to death.  His conviction and sentence were affirmed
on direct review.  State v. Thompson, 768 S.W.2d 239 (Tenn. 1989), cert. denied,
497 U.S. 1031, 111 L. Ed. 2d 796, 110 S. Ct. 3288 (1990).

In his state postconviction petition, Thompson claimed his trial counsel had
been ineffective for failing to conduct an adequate investigation into his
mental health. Thompson argued that his earlier head injuries had diminished his
mental capacity and that evidence of his condition should have been presented as
mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of trial.  Under Tennessee law,
mental illness that impairs a defendant's capacity to appreciate the
wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the
law is a mitigating factor in capital sentencing.  Tenn. Code Ann. §
39-2-203(j)(8) [*798]  (1982) (repealed); § 39-13-204(j)(8) (Lexis 2003).  The
postconviction court denied relief following an evidentiary hearing, and the
Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed.  Thompson v. State , 958 S.W.2d
156 (1997).  The Tennessee Supreme Court denied discretionary review.

Thompson renewed his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel  [***700]  claim on
federal habeas. Thompson's attorneys retained a psychologist, Dr. Faye Sultan,
to assist with the proceedings.  At this point, 13 years had passed since
Thompson's conviction.  Sultan examined and interviewed Thompson three times,
questioned his family members, and conducted an extensive review of his legal,
military, medical, and prison records, App. 12, before diagnosing him as
suffering from schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, id., at 20.  She
contended that Thompson's symptoms indicated he was ""suffering serious mental
illness at the time of the 1985 offense for which he has been convicted and
sentenced.  This mental illness would have substantially impaired Mr. Thompson's
ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law."" Ibid. Sultan
prepared an expert report on Thompson's behalf and was also deposed by the
State.

In February 2000, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Tennessee granted the State's motion for [**2829]  summary judgment and
dismissed the habeas petition.  The court held that Thompson failed to show that
the state court's resolution of his claim rested on an unreasonable application
of Supreme Court precedent or on an unreasonable determination of the facts in
light of the evidence presented in state court.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).  The
District Court also stated that Thompson had not presented ""any significant
probative evidence that [he] was suffering from a significant mental disease
that should have been presented to the jury during the punishment phase as
mitigation."" No. 4:98-cv-006 (ED Tenn., Feb. 17, 2000), App. to Pet. for [*799]
Cert. 270.  Sultan's deposition and report, however, had apparently not been
included in the District Court record.

While Thompson's appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit was
pending, he filed a motion in the District Court under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 60(b) requesting that the court supplement the record with Sultan's
expert report and deposition. Thompson's habeas counsel at the time explained
that the failure to include the Sultan evidence in the summary judgment record
was an oversight.  Thompson also asked the Court of Appeals to hold his case in
abeyance pending a ruling from the District Court and attached the Sultan
evidence in support of his motion.

The District Court denied the Rule 60(b) motion as untimely, and the Court of
Appeals denied Thompson's motion to hold his appeal in abeyance.  On January 9,
2003, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's
denial of habeas relief.  Thompson v. Bell, 315 F.3d 566.  The lead opinion,
authored by Judge Suhrheinrich, reasoned that there was no ineffective
assistance of counsel because Thompson's attorneys were aware of his head
injuries and made appropriate inquiries into his mental fitness.  Id., at
589-592.  In particular, Thompson's attorneys had requested that the trial court
order a competency evaluation.  A team of experts at the Middle Tennessee Mental
Health Institute, a state-run facility, found ""no mental illness, mental defect,
or insanity."" Id., at 589.  Dr. George Copple, the clinical psychologist
retained by Thompson's attorneys, also ""found no evidence of mental illness.""
Ibid. Judge Suhrheinrich emphasized that none of the experts retained by
Thompson since trial had offered an opinion on his mental  [***701]  condition
at the time of the crime.  Id., at 589-592.  The lead opinion contained a
passing reference to Thompson's unsuccessful Rule 60(b) motion, but did not
discuss the Sultan deposition or expert report in any detail.  Id., at 583, n.
13.  Judge Moore concurred in the result based on Thompson's failure to present
""evidence that his counsel [*800]  knew or should have known either that
Thompson was mentally ill or that his mental condition was deteriorating at the
time of his trial or at the time of his crime."" Id., at 595.

Thompson filed a petition for rehearing.  The petition placed substantial
emphasis on the Sultan evidence, quoting from both her deposition and expert
report.  The Court of Appeals denied the petition for rehearing and stayed the
issuance of its mandate pending the disposition of Thompson's petition for
certiorari.

This Court denied certiorari on December 1, 2003.  540 U.S. 1051, 157 L. Ed. 2d
701, 124 S. Ct. 804.  The following day, Thompson filed a motion in the Court of
Appeals seeking to extend the stay of mandate pending disposition of his
petition for rehearing in this Court.  The Court of Appeals granted the motion
and ""ordered that the mandate be stayed to allow appellant time to file a
petition for rehearing from the denial of the writ of certiorari, and thereafter
until the Supreme Court [**2830]  disposes of the case."" App. to Pet. for Cert.
348.  On January 20, 2004, this Court denied Thompson's petition for rehearing.
540 U.S. 1158, 157 L. Ed. 2d 1058, 124 S. Ct. 1162.  A copy of the order was
filed with the Court of Appeals on January 23, 2004.  The Court of Appeals,
however, did not issue its mandate.

The State, under the apparent assumption that the federal habeas corpus
proceedings had terminated, filed a motion before the Tennessee Supreme Court
requesting that an execution date be set.  The court scheduled Thompson's
execution for August 19, 2004.

From February to June 2004, there were proceedings in both state and federal
courts related to Thompson's present competency to be executed under Ford v.
Wainwrigh t, 477 U.S. 399, 91 L. Ed. 2d 335, 106 S. Ct. 2595 (1986).  The state
courts, after considering Sultan's testimony (which was based in part on
followup observations after her initial 1998 examination) as well as that of
other experts, found Thompson competent to be executed.  Thompson v. State, 134
S. W. 3d 168 (Tenn. 2004).  Thompson's Ford claim was still pending before the
Federal District  [*801]  Court when on June 23, 2004, some seven months after
this Court denied certiorari, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued
an amended opinion in Thompson's initial federal habeas case.  373 F.3d 688.
The new decision vacated the District Court's judgment denying habeas relief and
remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing on Thompson's
ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.  Id., at 691-692.  The Court of Appeals
relied on its equitable powers to supplement the record on appeal with Sultan's
1999 deposition after finding that it was ""apparently negligently omitted"" and
""probative of Thompson's mental state at the time of the crime."" Id., at 691.
The court also explained its authority to issue an amended opinion five months
after this Court denied a petition for rehearing: ""We rely on our inherent power
to reconsider our opinion prior to the issuance of the mandate,  [***702]  which
has not yet issued in this case."" Id., at 691-692.  Judge Suhrheinrich authored
a lengthy separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, which
explained that his chambers initiated the sua sponte reconsideration of the
case.  He agreed with the majority about the probative value of the Sultan
deposition, referring to the evidence as ""critical."" Id., at 733.  Unlike the
majority, however, Judge Suhrheinrich would have relied upon fraud on the court
to justify the decision to expand the record and issue an amended opinion.  Id.,
at 725-726, 729-742.  He found ""implausible"" the explanation offered by
Thompson's habeas counsel for his failure to include the Sultan deposition in
the District Court record, id., at 742, and speculated that counsel ""planned to
unveil Dr. Sultan's opinion on the eve of Thompson's execution,  "" id., at 738,
n. 21.

We granted certiorari.  543 U.S. 1042, 160 L. Ed. 2d 609, 125 S. Ct. 823 (2005).

[***LEdHR1A] [1B] At issue in this case is the scope of the Court of Appeals'
authority to withhold the mandate pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate
Procedure 41.  As relevant, the Rule provides:


      [*802]   [HN1] ""(b) When Issued.  The court's mandate must issue 7

     ""(D) The court of appeals must issue the mandate immediately when a

     certiorari is filed.""



Tennessee argues that the Court of Appeals was required to issue the mandate
following this Court's denial of Thompson's petition for certiorari.  The
State's position rests on Rule 41(d)(2)(D), which states that  [HN2] ""the court
of appeals  [*803]  must issue the mandate immediately when a copy of a
[***703]  Supreme Court order denying the petition for writ of certiorari is
filed."" This provision, the State points out, admits of no exceptions, so the
mandate should have issued on the date that a copy of this Court's order denying
certiorari was filed with the Court of Appeals, i.e., December 8, 2003.

The State further contends that because the mandate should have issued in
December 2003, the Court of Appeals' amended opinion was in essence a recall of
the mandate.  If this view is correct, the Court of Appeals' decision to revisit
its earlier opinion must satisfy the standard established by Calderon v.
Thompson , 523 U.S. 538, 140 L. Ed. 2d 728, 118 S. Ct. 1489 (1998).  Calderon
held that  [HN3] ""where a federal court of appeals sua sponte recalls its
mandate to revisit the merits of an earlier decision denying habeas corpus
relief to a state prisoner, the court abuses its discretion unless it acts to
avoid a miscarriage of justice as defined by our habeas corpus jurisprudence.""
Id., at 558, 140 L. Ed. 2d 728, 118 S. Ct. 1489.  See also Schlup v. Delo, 513
U.S. 298, 130 L. Ed. 2d 808, 115 S. Ct. 851 (1995); Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U.S.
333, 120 L. Ed. 2d 269, 112 S. Ct. 2514 (1992).

Thompson counters by arguing that Rule 41(d)(2)(D) is determinative only when
the court of appeals enters a stay of the mandate to allow the Supreme Court to
dispose of a petition for certiorari.  The provision, Thompson says, does not
affect the court of appeals' broad discretion to enter a stay for other reasons.
He relies on Rule 41(b), which provides the court of appeals may ""shorten or
extend the time"" in which to issue the mandate.  Because the authority vested by
Rule 41(b) is not limited to the period before a petition for certiorari is
denied, he argues that the Court of Appeals had the authority to stay its
mandate following this Court's denial of certiorari and rehearing.  Although the
Court of Appeals failed to issue an order staying the mandate after we denied
rehearing, Thompson asserts that the court exercised its Rule 41(b) powers by
simply failing to issue it.

To resolve this case, we need not adopt either party's interpretation of Rule 41
.  Instead, we hold that-assuming,  [**2832]   [*804]  arguendo, that the Rule
authorizes a stay of the mandate following the denial of certiorari and also
that a court may stay the mandate without entering an order-here the Court of
Appeals abused its discretion in doing so.

III

[***LEdHR1A] [1C] We find an abuse of discretion for the following reasons.

Prominent among our concerns is the length of time between this Court's denial
of certiorari and the Court of Appeals' issuance of its amended opinion.  We
denied Thompson's petition for certiorari in December 2003 and his petition for
rehearing one month later.  From this last denial, however, the Court of Appeals
delayed issuing its mandate for over five months, releasing its amended opinion
in June.

The consequence of delay for the State's criminal justice system was compounded
by the Court of Appeals' failure to issue an order or otherwise give notice to
the parties that the court was reconsidering its earlier opinion.  The Court of
Appeals had issued two earlier orders staying its mandate.  The first order
stayed the mandate pending disposition of  [***704]  Thompson's petition for
certiorari.  The second order extended the stay to allow Thompson time to file a
petition for rehearing with this Court and ""thereafter until the Supreme Court
disposes of the case."" So by the express terms of the second order the mandate
was not to be stayed after this Court acted; and when we denied rehearing on
January 20, 2004, the Court of Appeals' second stay dissolved by operation of
law.  Tennessee, acting in reliance on the Court of Appeals' earlier orders and
our denial of certiorari and rehearing, could assume that the mandate
would-indeed must-issue.  While it might have been prudent for the State to
verify that the mandate had issued, it is understandable that it proceeded to
schedule an execution date.  Thompson, after all,  had not sought an additional
stay of the mandate, and the Court of Appeals had given no indication that it
might be revisiting its earlier decision.

[*805]   [***LEdHR1A] [1D]  [***LEdHR2] [2] This latter point is important.  It
is an open question whether a court may exercise its Rule 41(b) authority to
extend the time for the mandate to issue through mere inaction.  Even assuming,
however, that a court could effect a stay for a short period of time by
withholding the mandate, a delay of five months is different in kind.   [HN4]
""Basic to the operation of the judicial system is the principle that a court
speaks through its judgments and orders."" Murdaugh Volkswagen, Inc. v. First
National Bank of South Carolina, 741 F.2d 41, 44 (CA4 1984).  Without a formal
docket entry neither the parties nor this Court had, or have, any way to know
whether the court had stayed the mandate or simply made a clerical mistake.  Cf.
Ballard v. Comm'r, 544 U.S. 40, 59-60, 161 L. Ed. 2d 227, 125 S. Ct. 1270 (2005)
.  The dissent claims ""the failure to notify the parties was likely due to a
simple clerical error"" on the part of the Clerk's office.  Post, at 285, 162 L.
Ed. 2d, at 717 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  The record lends no support to this
speculation.  The dissent also fails to explain why it is willing to apply a
""presumption of regularity"" to the panel's actions but not to the Clerk's.
Ibid.

[***LEdHR1A] [1E] The Court of Appeals could have spared the parties and the
state judicial system considerable time and resources if it had notified them
that it was reviewing its original panel decision.  After we denied Thompson's
petition for rehearing, Tennessee scheduled his execution date.  This, in turn,
led to various proceedings in state and federal court to determine Thompson's
present competency to be executed.  See,  [**2833]  e.g., Thompson v. State, 134
S. W. 3d 168 (Tenn. 2004).  All of these steps were taken in reliance on the
mistaken impression that Thompson's first federal habeas case was final.  The
State had begun to ""invoke its entire legal and moral authority in support of
executing its judgment."" Calderon v. Thompson, supra, at 556-557, 140 L. Ed. 2d
728, 118 S. Ct. 1489.

The parties' assumption that Thompson's habeas proceedings were complete was all
the more reasonable because the Court of Appeals' delay in issuing its mandate
took place  [*806]  after we had denied certiorari. As a practical matter,
[HN5] a decision by this Court denying discretionary review usually signals the
end of litigation.  While Rule 41(b) may authorize a court to stay the mandate
after certiorari is denied, the circumstances where such a stay  [***705]  would
be warranted are rare.  See, e.g., First Gibraltar Bank, FSB v. Morales, 42 F.3d
895 (CA5 1995); Alphin v. Henson, 552 F.2d 1033 (CA4 1977).  In the typical
case, where the stay of mandate is entered solely to allow this Court time to
consider a petition for certiorari, Rule 41(d)(2)(D) provides the default: ""The
court of appeals must issue the mandate immediately when a copy of a Supreme
Court order denying the petition for writ of certiorari is filed.""

By providing a mechanism for correcting errors in the courts of appeals before
Supreme Court review is requested, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure
ensure that litigation following the denial of certiorari will be infrequent.
See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 40(a)  [HN6] (""Unless the time is shortened or extended
by order or local rule, a petition for panel rehearing may be filed within 14
days after entry of judgment"").  See also Fed. Rules App. Proc. 35 (rehearing en
banc), 40 (panel rehearing).

Indeed, in this case Thompson's petition for rehearing and suggestion for
rehearing en banc pressed the same arguments that eventually were adopted by the
Court of Appeals in its amended opinion.  The Sultan evidence, first presented
to the Court of Appeals as an attachment to Thompson's motion to hold his appeal
in abeyance, was quoted extensively in the petition for rehearing to the Court
of Appeals. Pet. for Rehearing and Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc in No.
00-5516 (CA6), pp 12-20, 28-31.  After the request for rehearing was denied, the
State could have assumed with good reason that the Court of Appeals was not
impressed by Thompson's arguments based on the Sultan evidence.  The court's
opportunity to consider these arguments at the rehearing stage is yet another
factor supporting  [*807]  our determination that the decision to withhold the
mandate was in error.  Cf. Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. at 551-553, 140 L. Ed.
2d 728, 118 S. Ct. 1489 (questioning whether a ""mishandled law clerk transition""
and the ""failure of another judge to notice the action proposed by the original
panel"" would justify recalling the mandate in a nonhabeas case).

The dissent's explanation of how the Sultan evidence was overlooked is
inaccurate in several respects.  For example, the statements that the ""Sultan
documents were not in the initial record on appeal,"" post, at 821, 162 L. Ed.
2d, at 714, and that ""the panel previously had not seen these documents"" before
the rehearing stage, post at 822, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 714, convey the wrong
impression.  Although the Sultan evidence was not part of the District Court's
summary judgment record, the documents were included in the certified record on
appeal as attachments to Thompson's Rule 60(b) motion.  Record 133; Docket Entry
4/5/02 in No. 4:98-cv-006 (ED Tenn.); Docket Entry 4/10/02 in No. 00-5516 (CA6).
The dissent also argues the petition for rehearing did not adequately bring the
Sultan evidence to the attention of the Court of Appeals. Post, at 822, 826, 162
L. Ed. 2d, at 714-715, 717.  [**2834]  This is simply untrue.  The original
panel opinion, which did not discuss the Sultan evidence in any detail,
emphasized that Thompson had failed to produce any evidence that he was mentally
ill at the time of his offense.  315 F.3d at 590; id., at 595-596 (Moore, J.,
concurring in result).  The petition for rehearing  [***706]  attacked this
conclusion in no uncertain terms and placed the Sultan evidence front and
center.  Here, for example, is an excerpt from the petition's table of contents:



     ""II. THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN THE RECORD
     OF THOMPSON'S MENTAL ILLESS AT THE TIME OF THE CRIME IS WRONG

     ""A. Thompson Has Set Forth Above The Record Facts Demonstrating His
     Mental Illness At The Time Of The Crime

     [*808]  ""B. The Majority Overlooks The Facts And Expert Opinion Set
     Forth In Dr. Sultan's Report and Deposition."" Pet. for Rehearing and
     Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc in No. 00-5516 (CA6), p ii.



See also id., at 1 (mentioning the Sultan evidence in the second paragraph of
the statement in support of panel rehearing).  The rehearing petition did not
explain why Sultan's deposition and expert report had been omitted from the
summary judgment record, but that is beside the point.  The petition
acknowledged that the Sultan evidence was first presented to the District Court
as an attachment to the Rule 60(b) motion, id., at 29, and gave the Sultan
evidence a prominent and explicit mention in the table of contents.  It is
difficult to see how Thompson's counsel could have been clearer in telling the
Court of Appeals that it was wrong.  The dissent's treatment of this issue
assumes that judges forget even the basic details of a capital case only one
month after issuing a 38-page opinion and that judges cannot be relied upon to
read past the first page of a petition for rehearing.  The problem is that the
dissent cannot have it both ways: If the Sultan evidence is as crucial as the
dissent claims, it would not easily have been overlooked by the Court of Appeals
at the rehearing stage.

Our review of the Sultan deposition reinforces our conclusion that the Court of
Appeals abused its discretion by withholding the mandate.  Had the Sultan
deposition and report been fully considered in the federal habeas proceedings,
it no doubt would have been relevant to the District Court's analysis.  Based on
the Sultan deposition, Thompson could have argued he suffered from mental
illness at the time of his crime that would have been a mitigating factor under
Tennessee law and that his trial attorneys were constitutionally ineffective for
failing to conduct an adequate investigation into his mental health.

Relevant though the Sultan evidence may be, however, it is not of such a
character as to warrant the Court of Appeals'  [*809]  extraordinary departure
from standard appellate procedures.  There are ample grounds to conclude the
evidence was unlikely to have altered the District Court's resolution of
Thompson's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.  Sultan examined Thompson
for the first time on August 20, 1998, App. 37, some 13 years after Thompson's
crime and conviction.  She relied on the deterioration in Thompson's present
mental health-something that obviously was not observable at the time of
trial-as evidence of his condition in 1985.  (Indeed, there was a marked decline
in his condition during the 6-month period between Sultan's first two visits.
Id., at 51-58.) Sultan's findings regarding  [***707]  Thompson's condition in
1985 are contradicted by the testimony of two experts who examined [**2835]  him
at the time of trial, Dr. Watson and Dr. Copple.  Watson performed a battery of
tests at the Middle Tennessee Mental Health Institute, where Thompson was
referred by the trial court for an examination, and concluded that Thompson
""'[did] not appear to be suffering from any complicated mental disorder which
would impair his capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of the alleged
offenses, or which would impair his capacity to conform his conduct to the
requirements of the law.'"" 19 Tr. 164.  Indeed, Watson presented substantial
evidence supporting his conclusion that Thompson was malingering for mental
illness. Id., at 151-152; 20 id., at 153-160.  For example, Thompson claimed he
could not read despite a B average in high school and one year's college credit.
19 id., at 137; 20 id., at 151.  Thompson's test scores also indicated that he
was attempting to fake schizophrenia. 20 id., at 153-154.  Copple, the
psychologist retained by Thompson's defense team, agreed with Watson that
Thompson was not suffering from mental illness. 19 id., at 58.  Had the Sultan
deposition been included in the District Court record, Thompson still would have
faced an uphill battle to obtaining federal habeas relief.  He would have had to
argue that his trial attorneys should have continued to investigate his mental
[*810]  health even after both Watson and Copple had opined that there was
nothing to uncover.

Sultan's testimony does not negate Thompson's responsibility for committing the
underlying offense, but it does bear upon an argument that Thompson's attorneys
could have presented at sentencing.  Sultan's ultimate conclusion-that
Thompson's mental illness substantially impaired his ability to conform his
conduct to the requirements of the law-is couched in the language of a
mitigating factor under Tennessee law.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-2-203(j)(8) (1982).
See also § 39-13-204(j)(8) (Lexis 2003).  Thompson's trial attorneys, however,
chose not to pursue a mitigation strategy based on mental illness, stressing
instead character evidence from family and friends and expert testimony that he
had the capacity to adjust to prison. Thompson v. State, 958 S. W. 2d, at
164-165.  This strategic calculation, while ultimately unsuccessful, was based
on a reasonable investigation into Thompson's background.  Sultan relied on
three witnesses in preparing her report: Thompson's grandmother, sister, and
ex-girlfriend.  These witnesses not only were interviewed by the defense
attorneys; they testified at sentencing.  Consultation with these witnesses,
when combined with the opinions of Watson and Copple, provided an adequate basis
for Thompson's attorneys to conclude that focusing on Thompson's mental health
was not the best strategy.  As the Tennessee Court of Cri"

The question here is whether the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment
allows the display of a monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments on the
Texas State Capitol grounds.  We hold that it does.

The 22 acres surrounding the Texas State Capitol contain 17 monuments and 21
historical markers commemorating the ""people, ideals, and events that compose
Texan identity."" Tex. H. Con. Res. 38, 77th Leg., Reg. Sess. (2001). 1 The
monolith challenged here stands 6-feet high and 3-1/2 feet wide.  It is located
to the north of the Capitol building, between the Capitol and the Supreme Court
building.  Its primary content is the text of the Ten Commandments.  An eagle
grasping the American flag, an eye inside of a pyramid, and two small tablets
with what appears to be an ancient script are carved above the text of the Ten
Commandments.  Below the text are two Stars of David and the superimposed Greek
letters Chi and Rho, which represent Christ.  The bottom of the monument bears
the inscription ""PRESENTED  [*682]  TO THE PEOPLE AND YOUTH OF TEXAS BY THE
FRATERNAL ORDER OF EAGLES OF TEXAS 1961."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 21.

Korean War Veterans, Soldiers of World War I, Disabled Veterans, and Texas Peace
Officers.

The legislative record surrounding the State's acceptance of the monument from
the Eagles--a national social, civic,  and patriotic organization--is limited to
legislative journal entries.  After the monument was accepted, the State
selected a site for the monument based on the recommendation of the state
organization responsible for maintaining the Capitol grounds.  The Eagles paid
the cost of erecting the monument, the dedication of which was presided over by
two state legislators.

Petitioner Thomas Van Orden is a native Texan and a resident of Austin.  At one
time he was a licensed lawyer, having graduated from  [***614]  Southern
Methodist Law School.  Van Orden testified that, since 1995, he has encountered
the Ten Commandments monument during his frequent visits to the Capitol grounds.
His visits are typically for the purpose of using the law library in the Supreme
Court building, which is located just northwest of the Capitol building.

Forty years after the monument's erection and six years after Van Orden began to
encounter the monument frequently, he sued numerous state officials in their
official capacities under Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, seeking both a
declaration that the monument's placement violates the Establishment Clause and
an injunction requiring its removal.  After a bench trial, the District Court
held that the monument did not contravene the Establishment Clause.  It found
that the State had a valid secular purpose in recognizing and commending the
Eagles for their efforts to [**2859]  reduce juvenile delinquency.  The District
Court also determined that a reasonable observer, mindful of the history,
purpose, and context, would not conclude that this passive monument conveyed the
message that the State was seeking to endorse religion. The Court of Appeals
affirmed the District  [*683]  Court's holdings with respect to the monument's
purpose and effect.  351 F.3d 173 (CA5 2003).  We granted certiorari, 543 U.S.
923, 160 L. Ed. 2d 220, 125 S. Ct. 346 (2004), and now affirm.

Our cases, Januslike, point in two directions in applying the Establishment
Clause.  One face looks toward the strong role played by religion and religious
traditions throughout our Nation's history.  As we observed in School Dist. of
Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 10 L. Ed. 2d 844, 83 S. Ct. 1560
(1963):


     ""It is true that religion has been closely identified with our history
     and government.  . . .  The fact that the Founding Fathers believed
     devotedly that there was a God and that the unalienable rights of man
     were rooted in Him is clearly evidenced in their writings, from the
     Mayflower Compact to the Constitution itself.  . . .  It can be truly
     said, therefore, that today, as in the beginning, our national life
     reflects a religious people who, in the words of Madison, are
     'earnestly praying, as . . . in duty bound, that the Supreme Lawgiver
     of the Universe . . . guide them into every measure which may be
     worthy of his [blessing . . . .]'"" Id., at 212-213, 10 L. Ed. 2d 844,

The other face looks toward the principle that governmental intervention in
religious matters can itself endanger religious freedom.

This case, like all Establishment Clause challenges, presents us with the
difficulty of respecting both faces.  Our institutions presuppose a Supreme
Being, yet these institutions must not press religious observances upon their
citizens.  One face looks to the past in acknowledgment of our Nation's
heritage, while the other looks to the present in demanding a separation between
church and state.  Reconciling these two faces requires  [***615]  that we
neither abdicate our  [*684]  responsibility to maintain a division between
church and state nor evince a hostility to religion by disabling the government
from in some ways recognizing our religious heritage:


     ""When the state encourages religious instruction or cooperates with
     religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public events to
     sectarian needs, it follows the best of our traditions.  For it then
     respects the religious nature of our people and accommodates the
     public service to their spiritual needs.  To hold that it may not
     would be to find in the Constitution a requirement that the government
     show a callous indifference to religious groups.  . . .  [W]e find no
     constitutional requirement which makes it necessary for government to
     be hostile to religion and to throw its weight against efforts to
     widen the effective scope of religious influence."" Zorach v. Clauson,

post, at 710-711, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 633, and n 7 (dissenting opinion), we have
not, and do not, adhere to the principle that the Establishment Clause bars any
and all governmental preference for religion over irreligion.  See, e.g., Cutter
v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1020, 125 S. Ct. 2113 (2005);

Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U.S. 664, 25 L. Ed. 2d 697, 90 S. Ct. 1409
(1970).  Even the dissenters do not claim that the First Amendment's Religion
Clauses forbid all governmental acknowledgments, preferences, or accommodations

 [*685]   These two faces are evident in representative cases both upholding 4
[***616]  and invalidating 5 laws under the Establishment Clause.  Over the last
25 years, we have sometimes pointed [*686]  to Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602,
29 L. Ed. 2d 745, 91 S. Ct. 2105 (1971), [**2861]  as providing the governing
test in Establishment Clause challenges. 6 Compare Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S.
38, 86 L. Ed. 2d 29, 105 S. Ct. 2479 (1985) (applying Lemon), with Marsh v.
Chambers, 463 U.S. 783, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1019, 103 S. Ct. 3330 (1983) (not applying
Lemon).  Yet, just two years after Lemon was decided,  [HN1] we noted that the
factors identified in Lemon serve as ""no more than helpful signposts."" Hunt v.
McNair, 413 U.S. 734, 741, 37 L. Ed. 2d 923, 93 S. Ct. 2868 (1973).  Many of our
recent cases simply have not applied the Lemon test.  See, e.g., Zelman v.
Simmons-Harris, 536 U.S. 639, 153 L. Ed. 2d 604, 122 S. Ct. 2460 (2002); Good
News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U.S. 98, 150 L. Ed. 2d 151, 121 S. Ct.
2093 (2001).  Others have applied it only after concluding that the challenged
practice was invalid under a different Establishment Clause test.

Whatever may be the fate of the Lemon test in the larger scheme of Establishment
Clause jurisprudence, we think it not useful in dealing with the sort of passive
monument that Texas has erected on its Capitol grounds.  Instead, our analysis
is driven both by the nature of the monument and by our Nation's history.

As we explained in Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 79 L. Ed. 2d 604, 104 S. Ct.
1355 (1984): ""There is an unbroken history of official acknowledgment by all
three branches of government of the role of religion in American life from at
least 1789."" Id., at 674, 79 L. Ed. 2d 604, 104 S. Ct. 1355.  For example, both
Houses passed resolutions in 1789 asking President George Washington to issue a
Thanksgiving Day Proclamation to ""recommend to the people of the United States a
day of public thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed, by acknowledging, with
grateful  [***617]  hearts, the many and signal favors of Almighty God."" 1
Annals of Cong. 90, 914 (internal quotation marks omitted).  President
Washington's proclamation  [*687]  directly attributed to the Supreme Being the
foundations and successes of our young Nation:


     ""Now, therefore, I do recommend and assign Thursday, the 26th day of
     November next, to be devoted by the people of these States to the
     service of that great and glorious Being who is the beneficent author
     of all the good that was, that is, or that will be; that we may then
     all unite in rendering unto Him our sincere and humble thanks for His
     kind care and protection of the people of this country previous to
     their becoming a nation; for the signal and manifold mercies and the
     favorable interpositions of His providence in the course and
     conclusion of the late war; for the great degree of tranquillity,
     union, and plenty which we have since enjoyed; for the peaceable and
     rational manner in which we have been enabled to establish
     constitutions of government for our safety and happiness, and
     particularly the national one now lately instituted; for the civil and
     religious liberty with which we are blessed, and the means we have of
     acquiring and diffusing useful knowledge; and, in general, for all the
     great and various favors which He has been pleased to confer upon us.""
     1 J. Richardson, Messages and Papers of the Presidents, 1789-1897, p
     64 (1899).



Recognition of the role of God in our Nation's heritage has also been reflected
in our decisions.  We have acknowledged, for example, that ""religion has been
closely identified with our history and government,""  [**2862]  School Dist. of
Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U.S., at 212, 10 L. Ed. 2d 844, 83 S. Ct. 1560
, and that ""[t]he history of man is inseparable from the history of religion,""
Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 434, 8 L. Ed. 2d 601, 82 S. Ct. 1261 (1962). 7
This recognition  [*688]  has led us to hold that the Establishment Clause
permits a state legislature to open its daily sessions with a prayer by a
chaplain paid by the State.  Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S., at 792, 77 L. Ed. 2d
1019, 103 S. Ct. 3330. 8 Such a practice, we thought, was ""deeply embedded in
the history and tradition of this country."" Id., at 786, 77 L. Ed 2d 1019, 103
S. Ct. 3330.  As we observed there, ""it would be incongruous to interpret [the
Establishment Clause] as imposing more stringent First Amendment limits on the
states than the draftsmen imposed on the Federal Government."" Id., at 790-791,
77 L. Ed. 2d 1019, 103 S. Ct 3330.  With similar reasoning,  [***618]  we have
upheld laws, which originated from one of the Ten Commandments, that prohibited
the sale of merchandise on Sunday.  McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 431-440,
6 L. Ed. 2d 393, 81 S. Ct. 1101 (1961); see id., at 470-488, 6 L. Ed. 2d 393, 81

(""Examples of patriotic invocations of God and official acknowledgments of
religion's role in our Nation's history abound""); id., at 35-36, 159 L. Ed. 2d
98, 124 S. Ct. 2301 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (""It is unsurprising

Divine guidance"").

8 Indeed, we rejected the claim that an Establishment Clause violation was
presented because the prayers had once been offered in the Judeo-Christian
tradition: In Marsh, the prayers were often explicitly Christian, but the
chaplain removed all references to Christ the year after the suit was filed.

 In this case we are faced with a display of the Ten Commandments on government
property outside the Texas State Capitol. Such acknowledgments of the role
played by the Ten Commandments in our Nation's heritage are common throughout
America.  We need only look within our own Courtroom.  Since 1935, Moses has
stood, holding two tablets that reveal portions of the Ten Commandments written
in Hebrew, among other lawgivers in the south frieze.  Representations of the
Ten Commandments adorn the metal gates lining the north and south sides of the
Courtroom as well as the doors leading into the Courtroom.  Moses also sits on
the exterior east facade of the building holding the Ten Commandments tablets.

[*689]  Similar acknowledgments can be seen throughout a visitor's tour of our
Nation's Capital.  For example, a large statue of Moses holding the Ten
Commandments, alongside a statue of the Apostle Paul, has overlooked the rotunda
of the Library of Congress' Jefferson Building since 1897.  And the Jefferson
Building's Great Reading Room contains a sculpture of a woman beside the Ten
Commandments with a quote above her from the Old Testament (Micah 6:8).  A
medallion with two tablets depicting the Ten Commandments decorates the floor of
the National Archives.  Inside the Department of Justice, a statue entitled ""The
Spirit of Law"" has two tablets representing the Ten Commandments lying at its
feet.  In front of the Ronald Reagan Building is another sculpture that includes
a depiction of the Ten Commandments.  So too a 24-foot-tall sculpture,
depicting, among other things, the Ten Commandments and a cross, stands outside
the federal courthouse that houses [**2863]  both the Court of Appeals and the
District Court for the District of Columbia.  Moses is also prominently featured
in the Chamber of the United States House of Representatives. 9

9 Other examples of monuments and buildings reflecting the prominent role of
religion abound.  For example, the Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln Memorials
all contain explicit invocations of God's importance.  The apex of the
Washington Monument is inscribed ""Laus Deo,"" which is translated to mean ""Praise
be to God,"" and multiple memorial stones in the monument contain Biblical
citations.  The Jefferson Memorial is engraved with three quotes from Jefferson
that make God a central theme.  Inscribed on the wall of the Lincoln Memorial
are two of Lincoln's most famous speeches, the Gettysburg Address and his Second
Inaugural Address.  Both inscriptions include those speeches' extensive
acknowledgments of God. The first federal monument, which was accepted by the
United States in honor of sailors who died in Tripoli, noted the dates of the
fallen sailors as ""the year of our Lord, 1804, and in the 28 year of the
independence of the United States.""

 Our opinions, like our building, have recognized the role the Decalogue plays
in America's heritage. See, e.g., McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S., at 442, 6 L.
Ed. 2d 393, 81 S. Ct. 1101; id., at 462, 6 L. Ed. 2d 393, 81 S. Ct. 1101
(separate opinion  [*690]  of Frankfurter, J.). 10 The Executive and Legislative
Branches have also acknowledged  [***619]  the historical role of the Ten
Commandments.  See, e.g., Public Papers of the Presidents, Harry S. Truman,
1950, p 157 (1965); S. Con. Res. 13, 105th Cong., 1st Sess. (1997); H. Con. Res.
31, 105th Cong., 1st Sess. (1997).  These displays and recognitions of the Ten
Commandments bespeak the rich American tradition of religious acknowledgments.

 Of course, the Ten Commandments are religious--they were so viewed at their
inception and so remain.  The monument, therefore, has religious significance.
According to Judeo-Christian belief, the Ten Commandments were given to Moses by
God on Mt. Sinai.  But Moses was a lawgiver as well as a religious leader.  And
the Ten Commandments have an undeniable historical meaning, as the foregoing
examples demonstrate.   [HN2] Simply having religious content or promoting a
message consistent with a religious doctrine does not run afoul of the
Establishment Clause.  See Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S., at 680, 687, 79 L. Ed.
2d 604, 104 S. Ct. 1355; Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S., at 792, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1019,
103 S. Ct. 3330; McGowan v. Maryland, supra, at 437-440, 6 L. Ed. 2d 393, 81 S.

Ed. 2d 697, 90 S. Ct. 1409 (1970).

There are, of course, limits to the display of religious messages or symbols.
For example, we held unconstitutional a Kentucky statute requiring the posting
of the Ten Commandments in every public schoolroom.  Stone v. Graham, 449 U.S.
39, 66 L. Ed. 2d 199, 101 S. Ct. 192 (1980) (per curiam). In the classroom
context, we found that the Kentucky statute had an improper and plainly
religious purpose.  Id., at 41, 66 L. Ed. 2d 199, 101 S. Ct. 192.  As evidenced
by Stone's almost exclusive reliance upon two of our school  [*691]  prayer
cases, id., at 41-42, 66 L. ED. 2d 199, 101 S. Ct. 192 (citing School Dist. of
Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 10 L. Ed. 2d 844, 83 S. Ct. 1560
(1963), and Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 8 L. Ed. 2d 601, 82 S. Ct. 1261
(1962)), it stands as an example of the fact that we have ""been particularly
vigilant in monitoring compliance [**2864]  with the Establishment Clause in
elementary and secondary schools,"" Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578, 583-584,
96 L. Ed. 2d 510, 107 S. Ct. 2573 (1987).  Compare Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577,
596-597, 120 L. Ed. 2d 467, 112 S. Ct. 2649 (1992) (holding unconstitutional a
prayer at a secondary school graduation), with Marsh v. Chambers, supra
(upholding a prayer in the state legislature).  Indeed, Edwards v. Aguillard
recognized that Stone--along with Schempp and Engel--was a consequence of the
""particular concerns that arise in the context of public elementary and
secondary schools."" 482 U.S., at 584-585, 96 L. Ed. 2d 510, 107 S. Ct. 2573.
Neither Stone itself nor subsequent opinions have indicated that Stone's holding
would extend to a legislative chamber, see Marsh v.  [***620]  Chambers, supra,
or to capitol grounds. 11

11 Nor does anything suggest that Stone would extend to displays of the Ten
Commandments that lack a ""plainly religious,"" ""pre-eminent purpose,"" id., at 41,
66 L. Ed. 2d 199, 101 S. Ct. 192.  See Edwards v. Aguillard, supra, at 593-594,
96 L. Ed. 2d 510, 107 S. Ct. 2573 (""[Stone] did not mean that no use could ever
be made of the Ten Commandments, or that the Ten Commandments played an
exclusively religious role in the history of Western Civilization"").  Indeed, we
need not decide in this case the extent to which a primarily religious purpose
would affect our analysis because it is clear from the record that there is no
evidence of such a purpose in this case.

The placement of the Ten Commandments monument on the Texas State Capitol
grounds is a far more passive use of those texts than was the case in Stone,
where the text confronted elementary school students every day.  Indeed, Van
Orden, the petitioner here, apparently walked by the monument for a number of
years before bringing this lawsuit.  The monument is therefore also quite
different from the prayers involved in Schempp and Lee v. Weisman Texas has
treated its Capitol grounds monuments as representing the several strands in the
State's political and legal history.  The inclusion of the Ten Commandments
monument in this  [*692]  group has a dual significance, partaking of both
religion and government.  We cannot say that Texas' display of this monument
violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

CONCUR BY: SCALIA; THOMAS; BREYER

CONCUR

Justice Scalia, concurring.

I join the opinion of The Chief Justice because I think it accurately reflects
our current Establishment Clause jurisprudence--or at least the Establishment
Clause jurisprudence we currently apply some of the time.  I would prefer to
reach the same result by adopting an Establishment Clause jurisprudence that is
in accord with our Nation's past and present practices, and that can be
consistently applied--the central relevant feature of which is that there is
nothing unconstitutional in a State's favoring religion generally,  honoring God
through public prayer and acknowledgment, or, in a nonproselytizing manner,
venerating the Ten Commandments.  See McCreary County v. American Civil
Liberties Union of Ky., post, at 545 U.S. 844, 885-894, 162 L. Ed. 2d 729, 125
S. Ct. 2722, 2005 U.S. LEXIS 5211 (June 27, 2005) (Scalia, J., dissenting).

Justice Thomas, concurring.

The Court holds that the Ten Commandments monument found on the Texas State
Capitol grounds does not violate the Establishment Clause.  Rather than trying
to suggest meaninglessness where there is meaning, The Chief Justice rightly
recognizes that the monument has ""religious significance."" Ante, at 690, 162 L.
Ed. 2d, at 619.  He [**2865]  properly recognizes the role of religion in this
Nation's history and the permissibility of government displays acknowledging
that history.  Ante, at 686-688, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 616-617.  For those reasons,
I join The Chief Justice's opinion in full.

This case would be easy if the Court were willing to abandon the inconsistent
guideposts it has adopted for addressing [*693]  Establishment Clause  [***621]
challenges, * and return to the original meaning of the Clause.  I have
previously suggested that the Clause's text and history ""resis[t] incorporation""
against the States.  See Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1,
45-46, 159 L. Ed. 2d 98, 124 S. Ct. 2301 (2004) (opinion concurring in

153 L. Ed. 2d 604, 122 S. Ct. 2460"

 [*850]  [**2727]   Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A]  Executives of two counties posted a version of the Ten
Commandments on the walls of their courthouses. After suits were filed charging
violations of the Establishment Clause, the legislative body of each county
adopted a resolution calling for a more extensive exhibit meant to show that the
Commandments are Kentucky's ""precedent legal code,"" Def. Exh. 1 in Memorandum in
Support of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss in Civ. Action No. 99-507, p 1 (ED Ky.)
(hereinafter Def. Exh. 1).  The result in each instance was a modified display
of the Commandments surrounded by texts containing religious references as their
sole common element.  After changing counsel, the counties revised the exhibits
again by eliminating  [**2728] some documents, expanding the text set out in
another, and adding some new ones.

[***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR3A]  The issues are whether a determination of the
counties' purpose is a sound basis for ruling on the Establishment Clause
complaints, and whether evaluation of the counties' claim of secular purpose for
the ultimate displays may take their evolution into account.  We hold that the
counties' manifest objective may be dispositive of the constitutional  [*851]
enquiry, and that the development of the presentation should be  [***741]
considered when determining its purpose.

In the summer of 1999, petitioners McCreary County and Pulaski County, Kentucky
(hereinafter Counties), put up in their respective courthouses large,
gold-framed copies of an abridged text of the King James version of the Ten
Commandments, including a citation to the Book of Exodus. 1 In McCreary County,
the placement of the Commandments responded to an order of the county
legislative body requiring ""the display [to] be posted in 'a very high traffic
area' of the courthouse."" 96 F. Supp. 2d 679, 684 (ED Ky. 2000).  In Pulaski
County, amidst reported controversy over the propriety of the display, the
Commandments were hung in a ceremony presided over by the county
Judge-Executive, who called them ""good rules to live by"" and who recounted the
story of an astronaut who became convinced ""there must be a divine God"" after
viewing the Earth from the moon.  Dodson, Commonwealth Journal, July 25, 1999, p
A1, col. 2, in Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary
Injunction in Civ. Action No. 99-509 (ED Ky.) (internal quotation marks
omitted).  The Judge-Executive was accompanied by the pastor of his church, who
called the Commandments ""a creed of ethics"" and told the press after the
ceremony that displaying the Commandments was ""one of the greatest things the
judge could have done to close out the millennium."" Id., at A2, col. 3 (internal
quotation marks omitted).  In both Counties, this was the version of the
Commandments posted:


     ""Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

     [*852]  ""Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven images.

     ""Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.

     ""Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

     ""Honor thy father and thy mother.

     ""Thou shalt not kill.

     ""Thou shalt not commit adultery.

     ""Thou shalt not steal.

     ""Thou shalt not bear false witness.

     ""Thou shalt not covet.

     ""Exodus 20:3-17."" 2 Def. Exh. 9 in Memorandum in Support of
     Defendants' Motion to Dismiss in Civ. Action No. 99-507 (ED Ky.)
     (hereinafter Def. Exh. 9).




In each County, the hallway display was ""readily visible to . . . county
citizens who use the courthouse to conduct their civic business, to obtain or
renew driver's licenses and permits, to register cars, to pay local taxes, and
to register to vote."" 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 684; American Civil Liberties Union of

District Court and Court of Appeals.  That display is the subject of a separate
petition to this Court.

that were part of the County's first and second displays. The District Court
found that the displays in each County were functionally identical.  96 F. Supp.

 [***742]   [***LEdHR4A]  In November 1999, respondents American Civil Liberties
Union of Kentucky et al. sued the Counties in Federal District Court under Rev.
Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and sought a preliminary injunction against
maintaining the displays, which the ACLU charged were violations of the
prohibition of religious establishment included in the First Amendment of the
Constitution. 3 Within a month, and before  [*853]  the District Court had
responded to the request for injunction, the legislative body of each County
authorized a second, expanded display, by nearly identical resolutions reciting
that the Ten Commandments are ""the precedent legal code upon which the civil and
criminal codes of . . . Kentucky are founded,"" and stating several grounds for
taking that position: that ""the Ten Commandments are codified in Kentucky's
civil and criminal laws""; that the Kentucky House of Representatives had in 1993
""voted unanimously . . . to adjourn . . . 'in remembrance and honor of Jesus
Christ, the Prince of Ethics'""; that the ""County Judge and . . . magistrates
agree with the arguments set out by Judge [Roy] Moore"" in defense of his
""display [of] the Ten Commandments in his courtroom""; and that the ""Founding
Father[s] [had an] explicit understanding of the duty of elected officials to
publicly acknowledge God as the source of America's strength and direction.""

As directed by the resolutions, the Counties expanded the displays of the Ten
Commandments in their locations, presumably along with copies of the resolution,
which instructed that it, too, be posted, id., at 9.  In addition to the first
display's large framed copy of the edited King James version of the
Commandments, 4 the second included eight other documents in smaller frames,
each either having a religious  [*854]  theme or excerpted to highlight a
religious element.  The documents were the ""endowed by their Creator"" passage
from the Declaration of Independence; the Preamble to the Constitution of
Kentucky; the national motto, ""In God We Trust""; a page from the Congressional
Record of February 2, 1983, proclaiming the Year of the Bible and including a
statement of the Ten Commandments; a proclamation by President Abraham Lincoln
designating April 30, 1863, a National Day of Prayer and Humiliation; an excerpt
from President Lincoln's ""Reply to Loyal Colored People of Baltimore upon
Presentation of a Bible,"" reading that ""[t]he Bible is the best gift God has
ever given to man""; a proclamation by  [***743]  President Reagan marking 1983
the Year of the Bible; and the Mayflower [**2730]  Compact.  96 F. Supp. 2d, at

4 The District Court noted that there was some confusion as to whether the Ten
Commandments hung independently in the second display, or were incorporated into
the copy of the page from the Congressional Record declaring 1983 ""the Year of
the Bible."" 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 684, and n 4; 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 695-696, and n 4
.  The exhibits in the record depict the Commandments hanging as a separate
item, Def. Exh. 9, and that is more consistent with the Counties' description of
the second display in this Court.  ""[After erecting the first display]
Petitioners posted additional donated documents.  . . .  This display consisted
of the Ten Commandments along with other historical documents."" Brief for
Petitioners 2.  Like the District Court, we find our analysis applies equally to
either format.

 After argument, the District Court entered a preliminary injunction on May 5,
2000, ordering that the ""display . . . be removed from [each] County Courthouse
IMMEDIATELY"" and that no county official ""erect or cause to be erected similar
displays."" 96 F. Supp. 2d 691; 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 702-703.  The court's analysis
of the situation followed the three-part formulation first stated in Lemon v.
Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 29 L. Ed. 2d 745, 91 S. Ct. 2105 (1971).  As to
governmental purpose, it concluded that the original display ""lack[ed] any
secular purpose"" because the Commandments ""are a distinctly religious document,
believed by many Christians and Jews to be the direct and revealed word of God.""
96 F. Supp. 2d, at 686; 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 698.  Although the Counties had
maintained that the original display was meant to be educational, ""[t]he narrow
scope of the display--a single religious text unaccompanied by any
interpretation explaining its role as a foundational document--can hardly be
said to present meaningfully the story of this country's religious traditions.""
96 F. Supp. 2d, at 686-687; 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 698. The court found that the
second version also ""clearly lack[ed] a secular purpose"" because the ""Count[ies]
narrowly tailored [their] selection of  [*855]  foundational documents to
incorporate only those with specific references to Christianity."" 5 96 F. Supp.
2d, at 687; 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 699.

""Removed from their historical context and placed with other documents with
which the only common link is religion, the documents have the undeniable effect
of endorsing religion."" 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 688; 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 699-700.

The Counties filed a notice of appeal from the preliminary injunction but
voluntarily dismissed it after hiring new lawyers.  They then installed another
display in each courthouse, the third within a year.  No new resolution
authorized this one, nor did the Counties repeal the resolutions that preceded
the second.  The posting consists of nine framed documents of equal size,  one
of them setting out the Ten Commandments explicitly identified as the ""King
James Version"" at Exodus 20:3-17, 145 F. Supp. 2d 845, 847 (ED Ky. 2001), and
quoted at greater length than before:


     ""Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

     ""Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of
     any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or
     that is in the water underneath the earth: Thou shalt not bow down
     thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous
     God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the
     third and fourth generation of them that hate me.

     ""Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the
     LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

     ""Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

     ""Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the
     land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

     [***744]  ""Thou shalt not kill.

     [*856]  ""Thou shalt not commit adultery.

     ""Thou shalt not steal.

     ""Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

     ""Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet
     th[y] neighbor's wife,  nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor
     his ox, nor his ass, nor [**2731]  anything that is th[y]
     neighbour's."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 189a.



Assembled with the Commandments are framed copies of the Magna Carta, the
Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, the lyrics of the Star Spangled
Banner, the Mayflower Compact, the National Motto, the Preamble to the Kentucky
Constitution, and a picture of Lady Justice.  The collection is entitled ""The
Foundations of American Law and Government Display"" and each document comes with
a statement about its historical and legal significance.  The comment on the Ten
Commandments reads:


     ""The Ten Commandments have profoundly influenced the formation of
     Western legal thought and the formation of our country.  That
     influence is clearly seen in the Declaration of Independence, which
     declared that 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men
     are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
     unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the
     pursuit of Happiness.' The Ten Commandments provide the moral
     background of the Declaration of Independence and the foundation of
     our legal tradition."" Id.  , at 180a.



The ACLU moved to supplement the preliminary injunction to enjoin the Counties'
third display, 6 and the Counties responded with several explanations for the
new version, including  [*857]  desires ""to demonstrate that the Ten
Commandments were part of the foundation of American Law and Government"" and ""to
educate the citizens of the county regarding some of the documents that played a
significant role in the foundation of our system of law and government."" 145 F.
Supp. 2d, at 848 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The court, however, took
the objective of proclaiming the Commandments' foundational value as ""a
religious, rather than secular, purpose"" under Stone v. Graham, 449 U.S. 39, 66
L. Ed. 2d 199, 101 S. Ct. 192 (1980) (per curiam), 145 F. Supp. 2d, at 849, and
found that the assertion that the Counties' broader educational goals are
secular ""crumble[s] . . . upon an examination of the history of this
litigation,"" ibid. In light of the Counties' decision to post the Commandments
by themselves in the first instance, contrary to Stone, and later to
""accentuat[e]"" the religious objective by surrounding the Commandments with
""specific references to Christianity,  "" the District Court understood the
Counties' ""clear"" purpose as being to post the Commandments, not to educate. 7

6 Before the District Court issued the modified injunction, the Counties removed
the label of ""King James Version"" and the citation to Exodus.  145 F. Supp. 2d
845, 847 (ED Ky. 2001).

7 The court also found that the effect of the third display was to endorse
religion because the ""reasonable observer will see one religious code placed
alongside eight political or patriotic documents, and will understand that the
counties promote that one religious code as being on a par with our nation's
most cherished secular symbols and documents"" and because the ""reasonable
observer [would know] something of the controversy surrounding these displays,
which has focused on only one of the nine framed documents: the Ten
Commandments."" Id., at 851, 852.

 [***745]  As requested, the trial court supplemented the injunction,  and a
divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.  The
Circuit majority stressed that under Stone, displaying the Commandments bespeaks
a religious object unless they are integrated with other material so as to carry
""a secular message,"" 354 F.3d 438, 449 (2003).  The majority judges saw no
integration here because of a ""lack of a demonstrated analytical  [**2732] or
historical connection [between  [*858]  the Commandments and] the other
documents."" Id., at 451.  They noted in particular that the Counties offered no
support for their claim that the Ten Commandments ""provide[d] the moral
backdrop"" to the Declaration of Independence or otherwise ""profoundly
influenced"" it.  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  The majority found
that the Counties' purpose was religious, not educational, given the nature of
the Commandments as ""an active symbol of religion [stating] 'the religious
duties of believers.'"" Id., at 455.  The judges in the majority understood the
identical displays to emphasize ""a single religious influence, with no mention
of any other religious or secular influences,"" id., at 454, and they took the
very history of the litigation as evidence of the Counties' religious objective,
id., at 457.

Judge Ryan dissented on the basis of wide recognition that religion, and the Ten
Commandments in particular, have played a foundational part in the evolution of
American law and government; he saw no reason to gainsay the Counties' claim of
secular purposes.  Id., at 472-473.  The dissent denied that the prior displays
should have any bearing on the constitutionality of the current one: a ""history
of unconstitutional displays can[not] be used as a sword to strike down an
otherwise constitutional display."" 8 Id., at 478.

8 The Sixth Circuit did not decide whether the display had the impermissible
effect of advancing religion because one judge, having found the display
motivated by a religious purpose, did not reach that issue.  354 F.3d at 462
(Gibbons, J., concurring).  The other judge in the majority concluded that a
reasonable observer would find that the display had the effect of endorsing
religion given the lack of analytical connection between the Commandments and
the other documents in the display, the courthouse location of the display, and
the history of the displays. Id., at 458-459.  The dissent found no effect of
endorsement because it concluded that a reasonable observer would only see that
the County had merely acknowledged the foundational role of the Ten Commandments
rather than endorsed their religious content.  Id., at 479-480.

[*859]  II

Twenty-five years ago in a case prompted by posting the Ten Commandments in
Kentucky's public schools, this Court recognized that the Commandments ""are
undeniably a sacred text in the Jewish and Christian faiths"" and held that their
display in public classrooms violated the First Amendment's bar against
establishment of religion. Stone, 449 U.S., at 41, 66 L. Ed. 2d 199, 101 S. Ct.
192.  Stone found a predominantly religious purpose in the government's posting
of the Commandments, given their prominence as ""'an instrument of religion,'""
id., at 41, n. 3, 66 L. Ed. 2d 199, 101 S. Ct.  [***746]  192 (quoting School
Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 224, 10 L. Ed. 2d 844, 83
S. Ct. 1560 (1963)).  The Counties ask for a different approach here by arguing
that official purpose is unknowable and the search for it inherently vain.  In
the alternative, the Counties would avoid the District Court's conclusion by
having us limit the scope of the purpose enquiry so severely that any trivial
rationalization would suffice, under a standard oblivious to the history of
religious government action like the progression of exhibits in this case.

A

[***LEdHR2A]  Ever since Lemon v. Kurtzman summarized the three familiar
considerations for evaluating Establishment Clause claims, looking to whether
government action has ""a secular legislative purpose"" has been a common, albeit
seldom dispositive, element [**2733]  of our cases.  403 U.S., at 612, 29 L. Ed.
2d 745, 91 S. Ct. 2105.  Though we have found government action motivated by an
illegitimate purpose only four times since Lemon, 9 and ""the secular purpose
requirement alone may rarely be determinative . . ., it nevertheless serves an
important function."" 10 Wallace v.  [*860]  Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 75, 86 L. Ed.

10 At least since Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 91 L. Ed. 711,
67 S. Ct. 504 (1947), it has been clear that Establishment Clause doctrine lacks
the comfort of categorical absolutes.  In special instances we have found good
reason to hold governmental action legitimate even where its manifest purpose
was presumably religious. See, e.g., Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. 783, 77 L. Ed.
2d 1019, 103 S. Ct. 3330 (1983) (upholding legislative prayer despite its
religious nature).  No such reasons present themselves here.

  [HN2]  [***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR5A]  The touchstone for our analysis is the
principle that the ""First Amendment mandates governmental neutrality between
religion and religion, and between religion and nonreligion."" Epperson v.
Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97, 104, 21 L. Ed. 2d 228, 89 S. Ct. 266 (1968); Everson v.
Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 15-16, 91 L. Ed. 711, 67 S. Ct. 504 (1947);
Wallace, supra, at 53, 86 L. Ed. 2d 29, 105 S. Ct. 2479.  When the government
acts with the ostensible and predominant purpose of advancing religion, it
violates that central Establishment Clause value of official religious
neutrality, there being no neutrality when the government's ostensible object is
to take sides.  Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327, 335, 97 L. Ed. 2d 273, 107 S. Ct. 2862
(1987) (""Lemon's 'purpose' requirement aims at preventing [government] from
abandoning neutrality and acting with the intent of promoting a particular point
of view in religious matters"").  Manifesting a purpose to favor one faith over
another, or adherence to religion generally, clashes with the ""understanding,
reached . . . after decades of religious war, that liberty and social stability
demand a religious tolerance that respects the religious views of all citizens .
. . ."" Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U.S. 639, 718, 153 L. Ed. 2d 604, 122 S.
Ct. 2460 (2002) (Breyer, J., dissenting).  By  [***747]  showing a purpose to
favor religion, the government ""sends the . . . message to . . . nonadherents
'that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community, and an
accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members . . .
.'"" Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe, 530 U.S. 290, 309-310, 147 L. Ed.
2d 295, 120 S. Ct. 2266 (2000) (quoting Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 688, 79
L. Ed. 2d 604, 104 S. Ct. 1355 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring)).

[***LEdHR6] [6] Indeed, the purpose apparent from government action can have an
impact more significant than the result expressly  [*861]  decreed: when the
government maintains Sunday closing laws, it advances religion only minimally
because many working people would take the day as one of rest regardless, but if
the government justified its decision with a stated desire for all Americans to
honor Christ, the divisive thrust of the official action would be inescapable.
This is the teaching of McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 6 L. Ed. 2d 393, 81
S. Ct. 1101 (1961), which upheld Sunday closing statutes on practical,  secular
grounds after finding that the government had forsaken the religious purposes
behind [**2734]  centuries-old predecessor laws.  Id., at 449-451, 6 L. Ed. 2d
393, 81 S. Ct. 1101.

B

Despite the intuitive importance of official purpose to the realization of
Establishment Clause values, the Counties ask us to abandon Lemon's purpose
test, or at least to truncate any enquiry into purpose here.  Their first
argument is that the very consideration of purpose is deceptive: according to
them, true ""purpose"" is unknowable, and its search merely an excuse for courts
to act selectively and unpredictably in picking out evidence of subjective
intent.  The assertions are as seismic as they are unconvincing.

[HN3] Examination of purpose is a staple of statutory interpretation that makes
up the daily fare of every appellate court in the country, e.g., General
Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U.S. 581, 600, 157 L. Ed. 2d 1094, 124
S. Ct. 1236 (2004) (interpreting statute in light of its ""text, structure,
purpose, and history""), and governmental purpose is a key element of a good deal
of constitutional doctrine, e.g., Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 48 L. Ed.
2d 597, 96 S. Ct. 2040 (1976) (discriminatory purpose required for Equal
Protection violation); Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432
U.S. 333, 352-353, 53 L. Ed. 2d 383, 97 S. Ct. 2434 (1977) (discriminatory
purpose relevant to dormant Commerce Clause claim); Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye,
Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 124 L. Ed. 2d 472, 113 S. Ct. 2217 (1993)
(discriminatory purpose raises level of scrutiny required by free exercise
claim).  With enquiries into purpose this common, if they were nothing but hunts
for mares' nests deflecting  [*862]  attention from bare judicial will, the
whole notion of purpose in law would have dropped into disrepute long ago.

[***LEdHR2A]  But scrutinizing purpose does make practical sense, as in
Establishment Clause analysis, where an understanding of official objective
emerges from readily discoverable fact, without any judicial psychoanalysis of a
drafter's heart of hearts.  Wallace, 472 U.S., at 74, 86 L. Ed. 2d 29, 105 S.
Ct. 2479  [***748]  (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  The eyes that look
to purpose belong to an ""'objective observer,'"" one who takes account of the
traditional external signs that show up in the ""'text, legislative history, and
implementation of the statute,'"" or comparable official act.  Santa Fe, supra,
at 308, 120 S. Ct. 2266, 147 L. Ed. 2d 295  (quoting Wallace, supra, 472 U.S.,
at 76, 86 L. Ed. 2d 29, 105 S. Ct. 2479) (O'Connor, J., concurring in
judgment)); see also Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578, 594-595, 96 L. Ed. 2d
510, 107 S. Ct. 2573 (1987) (enquiry looks to ""plain meaning of the statute's
words, enlightened by their context and the contemporaneous legislative history
[and] the historical context of the statute, . . . and the specific sequence of
events leading to [its] passage"").  There is, then, nothing hinting at an
unpredictable or disingenuous exercise when a court enquires into purpose after
a claim is raised under the Establishment Clause.

The cases with findings of a predominantly religious purpose point to the
straightforward nature of the test.  In Wallace, for example, we inferred
purpose from a change of wording from an earlier statute to a later one, each
dealing with prayer in schools.  472 U.S., at 58-60, 86 L. Ed. 2d 29, 105 S. Ct.
2479.  And in Edwards, we relied on a statute's text and the detailed public
comments of its sponsor, when we sought the purpose of a state law requiring
creationism to be taught alongside evolution.  482 U.S., at 586-588, 96 L. Ed.
2d 510, 107 S. Ct. 2573.  In other cases, the government action itself bespoke
the purpose, as in Abington, where the object of required Bible study in
[**2735]  public schools was patently religious, 374 U.S., at 223-224, 10 L. Ed.
2d 844, 83 S. Ct. 1560; in Stone, the Court held that the ""[p]osting of
religious texts on the wall serve[d] no . . . educational function,"" and found
that if ""the posted copies of the Ten Commandments [were] to have any effect at
all, it  [*863]  [would] be to induce the schoolchildren to read, meditate upon,
perhaps to venerate and obey, the Commandments."" 449 U.S., at 42, 66 L. Ed. 2d
199, 101 S. Ct. 192.  In each case, the government's action was held
unconstitutional only because openly available data supported a commonsense
conclusion that a religious objective permeated the government's action.

[***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR7] [7] Nor is there any indication that the enquiry is
rigged in practice to finding a religious purpose dominant every time a case is
filed.  In the past, the test has not been fatal very often, presumably because
government does not generally act unconstitutionally, with the predominant
purpose of advancing religion. That said,  [HN4] one consequence of the
corollary that Establishment Clause analysis does not look to the veiled psyche
of government officers could be that in some of the cases in which establishment
complaints failed, savvy officials had disguised their religious intent so
cleverly that the objective observer just missed it.  But that is no reason for
great constitutional concern.  If someone in the government hides religious
motive so well that the ""'objective observer"

 I

California has been a pioneer in the regulation of marijuana. In 1913,
California was one of the first States to prohibit the sale and possession of
marijuana, 2 and at the end of the century, California became the first State to
authorize limited use of the drug for medicinal purposes.  In 1996, California
voters passed Proposition 215, now codified as the Compassionate Use Act of
1996. 3 The proposition was designed  [*6]  to ensure that ""seriously ill""
residents of the State have access to marijuana for medical purposes, and to
encourage Federal and State Governments to take steps towards ensuring the safe
and affordable distribution of the drug to patients in need. 4 The Act creates
an exemption from criminal prosecution  [***12]  for physicians, 5 as well as
for patients and primary caregivers who possess or cultivate marijuana for
medicinal purposes with the recommendation or approval of a physician. 6 A
""primary caregiver"" is a person who has consistently assumed responsibility for
the housing, health, or safety of the patient. 7

Respondents Angel Raich and Diane Monson are California residents who suffer
from a variety of serious medical conditions and have sought to avail themselves
of medical marijuana pursuant to [**2200]  the terms of the Compassionate Use
[*7]  Act.  They are being treated by licensed, board-certified family
practitioners, who have concluded, after prescribing a host of conventional
medicines to treat respondents' conditions and to alleviate their associated
symptoms, that marijuana is the only drug available that provides effective
treatment.  Both women have been using marijuana as a medication for several
years pursuant to their doctors' recommendation, and both rely heavily on
cannabis to function on a daily basis.  Indeed, Raich's physician believes that
forgoing cannabis treatments would certainly cause Raich excruciating pain and
could very well prove fatal.

Respondent Monson cultivates her own marijuana, and ingests the drug in a
variety of ways including smoking and using a vaporizer.  Respondent Raich, by
contrast, is unable to cultivate her own, and thus relies on two caregivers,
litigating as ""John Does,"" to provide her with locally grown marijuana at no
charge.  These caregivers also process the cannabis into hashish or keif, and
Raich herself processes some of the marijuana into oils, balms, and foods for
consumption.

On August 15, 2002, county deputy sheriffs and agents from the federal Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) came to Monson's home.  After a thorough
investigation, the county officials concluded that her use of marijuana was
entirely lawful as a matter of California law.  Nevertheless, after a 3-hour
standoff, the federal agents seized and destroyed all six of her cannabis
plants.

Respondents thereafter brought this action against the Attorney General of the
United States and the head of the DEA seeking injunctive and declaratory relief
prohibiting the enforcement of the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 84
Stat. 1242, 21 U.S.C. § 801 et seq., to the extent it prevents them from
possessing, obtaining, or manufacturing cannabis for their personal medical use.
In their complaint and supporting affidavits, Raich and Monson described the
severity of their afflictions, their repeatedly futile attempts  [*8]  to obtain
[***13]  relief with conventional medications, and the opinions of their doctors
concerning their need to use marijuana. Respondents claimed that enforcing the
CSA against them would violate the Commerce Clause, the Due Process Clause of
the Fifth Amendment, the Ninth and Tenth Amendments of the Constitution, and the
doctrine of medical necessity.

The District Court denied respondents' motion for a preliminary injunction.
Raich v. Ashcroft, 248 F. Supp. 2d 918 (ND Cal. 2003).  Although the court found
that the federal enforcement interests ""wane[d]"" when compared to the harm that
California residents would suffer if denied access to medically necessary
marijuana, it concluded that respondents could not demonstrate a likelihood of
success on the merits of their legal claims.   Id., at 931.

A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and
ordered the District Court to enter a preliminary injunction. 8 Raich v.
Ashcroft, 352 F.3d 1222 (2003).  The court found that respondents had
""demonstrated a strong likelihood [**2201]  of success on their claim that, as
applied to them, the CSA is an unconstitutional exercise of Congress' Commerce
Clause authority.""  Id., at 1227.  The Court of Appeals distinguished prior
Circuit cases upholding the CSA in the face of Commerce Clause challenges by
focusing on what it deemed to be the ""separate and distinct class of activities""
at issue in this case: ""the intrastate, noncommercial cultivation and possession
of cannabis for personal medical purposes as recommended by a patient's
physician pursuant to valid California state law.""  Id., at 1228.  The  [*9]
court found the latter class of activities ""different in kind from drug
trafficking""  because interposing a physician's recommendation raises different
health and safety concerns, and because ""this limited use is clearly distinct
from the broader illicit drug market--as well as any broader commercial market
for medicinal marijuana--insofar as the medicinal marijuana at issue in this
case is not intended for, nor does it enter, the stream of commerce."" Ibid.

The majority placed heavy reliance on our decisions in  United States v. Lopez,
514 U.S. 549, 131 L. Ed. 2d 626, 115 S. Ct. 1624 (1995), and  United States v.
Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 146 L. Ed. 2d 658, 120 S. Ct. 1740 (2000), as
interpreted by recent Circuit precedent, to hold that this separate class of
purely local activities was beyond the reach of federal power.  In contrast, the
dissenting judge concluded that the CSA, as applied to respondents, was clearly
valid under Lopez and Morrison; moreover, he thought it ""simply impossible to
distinguish the relevant conduct surrounding the cultivation and use of the
marijuana crop at issue in this case from the cultivation and use of the wheat
crop that affected interstate commerce in Wickard v. Filburn.""  352 F.3d, at
1235 [***14]  (Beam, J., dissenting) (citation omitted).

[***LEdHR1A]  The obvious importance of the case prompted our grant of
certiorari.   542 U.S. 936, 542 U.S. 936, 159 L. Ed. 2d 811, 124 S. Ct. 2909
(2004).  The case is made difficult by respondents' strong arguments that they
will suffer irreparable harm because, despite a congressional finding to the
contrary, marijuana does have valid therapeutic purposes.  The question before
us, however, is not whether it is wise to enforce the statute in these
circumstances; rather, it is whether Congress' power to regulate interstate
markets for medicinal substances encompasses the portions of those markets that
are supplied with drugs produced and consumed locally.  Well-settled law
controls our answer.  The CSA is a valid exercise of federal power, even as
applied to the troubling facts of this case.  We accordingly vacate the judgment
of the Court of Appeals.

Shortly after taking office in 1969, President Nixon declared a national ""war on
drugs."" 9 As the first campaign of that war, Congress set out to enact
legislation that would consolidate various drug laws on the books into a
comprehensive statute, provide meaningful regulation over legitimate sources of
drugs to prevent diversion into illegal channels, and strengthen law enforcement
tools against the traffic in illicit drugs. 10 That effort culminated in the
passage of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 84
Stat. 1236.

 [**2202]   This was not, however, Congress' first attempt to regulate the
national market in drugs.  Rather, as early as 1906 Congress enacted federal
legislation imposing labeling regulations on medications and prohibiting the
manufacture or shipment of any adulterated or misbranded drug traveling in
interstate commerce. 11 Aside from these labeling restrictions, most domestic
drug regulations prior to 1970 generally came in the guise of revenue laws, with
the Department of the Treasury serving as the Federal Government's primary
enforcer. 12 For example, the primary drug control law, before being repealed by
the passage of the CSA, was the Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914, 38 Stat. 785
(repealed 1970).  The Harrison Act sought to exert control over the possession
and sale of narcotics, specifically cocaine and opiates, by requiring producers,
distributors, and purchasers to register with the Federal Government, by
assessing taxes against  [*11]  parties so registered, and by regulating the
issuance of prescriptions. 13

Marijuana itself was not significantly regulated by the Federal Government until
1937 when accounts of  [***15]  marijuana's addictive qualities and
physiological effects, paired with dissatisfaction with enforcement efforts at
state and local levels, prompted Congress to pass the Marihuana Tax Act, Pub. L.
75-238, 50 Stat. 551 (repealed 1970). 14 Like the Harrison Act, the Marihuana
Tax Act did not outlaw the possession or sale of marijuana outright.  Rather, it
imposed registration and reporting requirements for all individuals importing,
producing, selling, or dealing in marijuana, and required the payment of annual
taxes in addition to transfer taxes whenever the drug changed hands. 15
Moreover, doctors wishing to prescribe marijuana for medical purposes were
required to comply with rather burdensome administrative requirements. 16
Noncompliance exposed traffickers to severe federal penalties, whereas
compliance would often subject them to prosecution under state law. 17 Thus,
while the Marihuana Tax Act did not declare the drug illegal per se, the onerous
administrative requirements, the prohibitively expensive taxes, and the risks
attendant on compliance practically curtailed the marijuana trade.

Then in 1970, after declaration of the national ""war on drugs,"" federal drug
policy underwent a significant transformation.  A number of noteworthy events
precipitated  [*12]  this policy shift.  First, in  Leary v. United States, 395
U.S. 6, 23 L. Ed. 2d 57, 89 S. Ct. 1532 (1969), this Court held certain
provisions of the Marihuana Tax Act and other narcotics legislation
unconstitutional.  Second, at the end of his term, President Johnson
fundamentally reorganized the federal drug control agencies.  The Bureau
[**2203]  of Narcotics, then housed in the Department of Treasury, merged with
the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control, then housed in the Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare (HEW), to create the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous
Drugs, currently housed in the Department of Justice. 18 Finally, prompted by a
perceived need to consolidate the growing number of piecemeal drug laws and to
enhance federal drug enforcement powers, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Drug
Abuse Prevention and Control Act. 19

18 Musto & Korsmeyer 32-35; 26 Almanac 533.  In 1973, the Bureau of Narcotics
and Dangerous Drugs became the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).  See
Reorg. Plan No. 2 of 1973, § 1, 28 CFR § 0.100 (1973).

19 The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 consists of
three titles.  Title I relates to the prevention and treatment of narcotic
addicts through HEW (now the Department of Health and Human Services).  84 Stat.
1238.  Title II, as discussed in more detail above, addresses drug control and
enforcement as administered by the Attorney General and the DEA.  Id., at 1242.
Title III concerns the import and export of controlled substances.  Id., at
1285.

 Title II of that Act, the CSA, repealed most of the earlier antidrug laws in
favor of a comprehensive  [***16]  regime to combat the international and
interstate traffic in illicit drugs.  The main objectives of the CSA were to
conquer drug abuse and to control the legitimate and illegitimate traffic in
controlled substances. 20 Congress was particularly concerned with the  [*13]
need to prevent the diversion of drugs from legitimate to illicit channels. 21

20 In particular, Congress made the following findings:  [HN1] ""(1) Many of the
drugs included within this subchapter have a useful and legitimate medical
purpose and are necessary to maintain the health and general welfare of the
American people. ""(2) The illegal importation, manufacture, distribution, and
possession and improper use of controlled substances have a substantial and
detrimental effect on the health and general welfare of the American people.
""(3) A major portion of the traffic in controlled substances flows through
interstate and foreign commerce. Incidents of the traffic which are not an
integral part of the interstate or foreign flow, such as manufacture, local
distribution, and possession, nonetheless have a substantial and direct effect
upon interstate commerce because-- ""(A) after manufacture, many controlled
substances are transported in interstate commerce, ""(B) controlled substances
distributed locally usually have been transported in interstate commerce
immediately before their distribution, and ""(C) controlled substances possessed
commonly flow through interstate commerce immediately prior to such possession.
""(4) Local distribution and possession of controlled substances contribute to
swelling the interstate traffic in such substances. ""(5) Controlled substances
manufactured and distributed intrastate cannot be differentiated from controlled
substances manufactured and distributed interstate. Thus, it is not feasible to
distinguish, in terms of controls, between controlled substances manufactured
and distributed interstate and controlled substances manufactured and
distributed intrastate. ""(6) Federal control of the intrastate incidents of the
traffic in controlled substances is essential to the effective control of the
interstate incidents of such traffic."" 21 U.S.C. §§ 801(1)-(6).

21 See  United States v. Moore, 423 U.S. 122, 135, 46 L. Ed. 2d 333, 96 S. Ct.
335 (1975); see also H. R. Rep., at 22.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

To effectuate these goals,  [HN2] Congress devised a closed regulatory system
making it unlawful to manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess any
controlled substance except in a manner authorized by the CSA.  21 U.S.C. §§
841(a)(1), 844(a).  The CSA categorizes all controlled substances into five
schedules.  § 812.  The drugs are grouped together based on their accepted
medical uses, the potential for abuse, and [**2204]  their psychological and
physical effects on the body.   [*14]  §§ 811, 812.  Each schedule is associated
with a distinct set of controls regarding the manufacture, distribution, and use
of the substances listed therein.  §§ 821-830.  The CSA and its implementing
regulations set forth strict requirements regarding registration, labeling and
packaging, production quotas, drug security, and recordkeeping.  Ibid. 21 CFR §
1301 et seq. (2004).

[HN3] In enacting the CSA, Congress classified marijuana as a Schedule I drug.
21 U.S.C. § 812(c).  This preliminary classification was based, in part, on the
recommendation of the Assistant Secretary of HEW ""that marihuana be retained
within schedule I at least until the completion of certain studies now
underway."" 22 Schedule I drugs are categorized as such because of their high
potential for abuse, lack of any accepted medical use, and absence of any
accepted safety for use in medically supervised  [***17]  treatment.  §
812(b)(1).  These three factors, in varying gradations, are also used to
categorize drugs in the other four schedules.  For example, Schedule II
substances also have a high potential for abuse which may lead to severe
psychological or physical dependence, but unlike Schedule I drugs, they have a
currently accepted medical use.  § 812(b)(2).  By classifying marijuana as a
Schedule I drug, as opposed to listing it on a lesser schedule, the manufacture,
distribution, or possession of marijuana became a criminal offense, with the

[***LEdHR1A]  Respondents in this case do not dispute that passage of the CSA,
as part of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, was well
within Congress' commerce power. Brief for Respondents 22, 38.  Nor do they
contend that any provision or section of the CSA amounts to an unconstitutional
exercise of congressional authority.  Rather, respondents' challenge is actually
quite limited; they argue that the CSA's categorical prohibition of the
manufacture and possession [**2205]  of marijuana as applied to the intrastate
manufacture and possession of marijuana for medical purposes pursuant to
California law exceeds Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause.

In assessing the validity of congressional regulation, none of our Commerce
Clause cases can be viewed in isolation.  As charted in considerable detail in
United States v. Lopez, our understanding of the reach of the Commerce Clause,
as well as Congress' assertion of authority thereunder, has  [*16]  evolved over
time. 24 The Commerce Clause emerged as the Framers' response to the central
problem giving rise to the Constitution itself: the absence of any federal
commerce power under  [***18]  the Articles of Confederation. 25 For the first
century of our history, the primary use of the Clause was to preclude the kind
of discriminatory state legislation that had once been permissible. 26 Then, in
response to rapid industrial development and an increasingly interdependent
national economy, Congress ""ushered in a new era of federal regulation under the
commerce power,"" beginning with the enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act in
1887, 24 Stat. 379, and the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890, 26 Stat. 209, as
amended, 15 U.S.C. § 2 et seq. 27

 [***LEdHR2] [2] Cases decided during that ""new era,"" which now spans more than
a century, have identified three general categories of regulation in which
Congress is authorized to engage under its commerce power. First, Congress can
regulate the channels of interstate commerce.  Perez v. United States, 402 U.S.
146, 150, 28 L. Ed. 2d 686, 91 S. Ct. 1357 (1971).  Second, Congress has
authority to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce,
and persons or things in interstate  [*17]  commerce. Ibid. Third,  [HN4]
Congress has the power to regulate activities that substantially affect
interstate commerce. Ibid.;  NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1,
37, 81 L. Ed. 893, 57 S. Ct. 615 (1937).  Only the third category is implicated
in the case at hand.

[HN5]  [***LEdHR3] [3]  [***LEdHR4] [4] Our case law firmly establishes
Congress' power to regulate purely local activities that are part of an economic
""class of activities"" that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.
See, e.g.,  Perez, 402 U.S., at 151, 28 L. Ed. 2d 686, 91 S. Ct. 1357;  Wickard
v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 128-129, 87 L. Ed. 122, 63 S. Ct. 82 (1942).  As we
stated in Wickard, ""even if appellee's activity be local and though it may not
be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by
Congress if [**2206]  it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate
commerce.""  Id., at 125, 87 L. Ed. 122, 63 S. Ct. 82.  We have never required

 [*472]  [**2658]   Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]  In 2000, the city of New London approved a

assembling the land needed for this project, the city's development agent has
purchased property from willing sellers and proposes to use the power of eminent
domain to acquire the remainder of the property from unwilling owners in
exchange for just compensation.  The question presented is whether the city's
proposed disposition of this property qualifies as a ""public use"" within the
meaning of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. 1

 [*473]  I

The city of New London (hereinafter City) sits at the junction of the Thames
River and the Long Island Sound in southeastern Connecticut.  Decades of
economic decline led a state agency in 1990 to designate the City a ""distressed
municipality."" In 1996, the Federal Government closed the Naval Undersea Warfare
Center, which had been located in the Fort Trumbull area of the City and had
employed over 1,500 people.  In 1998, the City's unemployment rate was nearly
double that of the State, and its population of just under 24,000 residents was
at its lowest since 1920.

These conditions prompted state and local officials to target New London, and
[**2659]  particularly its Fort Trumbull area, for economic revitalization.  To
this end, respondent New London Development Corporation (NLDC), a private
nonprofit entity established some years earlier to assist the City in planning
economic development, was reactivated.  In January 1998, the State authorized a
$5.35 million bond issue to support the NLDC's planning activities and a $10
million bond issue toward the creation of a Fort Trumbull State Park.  In
February, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. announced that it would build a
$300 million research facility on a site immediately adjacent to Fort Trumbull;
local planners hoped that Pfizer would draw new business to the area, thereby
serving as a catalyst to the area's rejuvenation.  After receiving initial
approval from the city council, the NLDC continued its planning activities and
held a series of neighborhood meetings to educate the public about the process.
[***448]  In May, the city council authorized the NLDC to formally submit its
plans to the relevant state agencies for review. 2 Upon obtaining state-level
approval, the NLDC  [*474]  finalized an integrated development plan focused on
90 acres of the Fort Trumbull area.

2 Various state agencies studied the project's economic, environmental, and
social ramifications.  As part of this process, a team of consultants evaluated
six alternative development proposals for the area, which varied in
extensiveness and emphasis.  The Office of Policy and Management, one of the
primary state agencies undertaking the review, made findings that the project
was consistent with relevant state and municipal development policies.  See App.
89-95.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The Fort Trumbull area is situated on a peninsula that juts into the Thames
River.  The area comprises approximately 115 privately owned properties, as well
as the 32 acres of land formerly occupied by the naval facility (Trumbull State
Park now occupies 18 of those 32 acres).  The development plan encompasses seven
parcels. Parcel 1 is designated for a waterfront conference hotel at the center
of a ""small urban village"" that will include restaurants and shopping.  This
parcel will also have marinas for both recreational and commercial uses.  A
pedestrian ""riverwalk"" will originate here and continue down the coast,
connecting the waterfront areas of the development.  Parcel 2 will be the site
of approximately 80 new residences organized into an urban neighborhood and
linked by public walkway to the remainder of the development, including the
state park.  This parcel also includes space reserved for a new U. S. Coast
Guard Museum.  Parcel 3, which is located immediately north of the Pfizer
facility, will contain at least 90,000 square feet of research and development
office space.  Parcel 4A is a 2.4-acre site that will be used either to support
the adjacent state park, by providing parking or retail services for visitors,
or to support the nearby marina.  Parcel 4B will include a renovated marina, as
well as the final stretch of the riverwalk.  Parcels 5, 6, and 7 will provide
land for office and retail space, parking, and water-dependent commercial uses.
App. 109-113.

The NLDC intended the development plan to capitalize on the arrival of the
Pfizer facility and the new commerce it was expected to attract.  In addition to
creating jobs, generating tax revenue, and helping to ""build momentum for the
revitalization of downtown New London,"" id., at 92, the plan was also designed
to make the City more attractive and to create  [*475]  leisure and recreational
opportunities on the waterfront and in the park.

The city council approved the plan in January 2000, and designated the NLDC as
its development agent in charge of implementation.  See Conn. Gen. Stat. § 8-188
[**2660]  (2005).  The city council also authorized the NLDC to purchase
property or to acquire property by exercising eminent domain in the City's name.
§ 8-193.  The NLDC successfully negotiated the purchase of most of the real
estate in the 90-acre area, but its negotiations with petitioners failed.  As a
consequence, in November 2000, the NLDC initiated the condemnation proceedings
that gave rise to this case. 3

 [***449]   II

Petitioner Susette Kelo has lived in the Fort Trumbull area since 1997.  She has
made extensive improvements to her house, which she prizes for its water view.
Petitioner Wilhelmina Dery was born in her Fort Trumbull house in 1918 and has
lived there her entire life.  Her husband Charles (also a petitioner) has lived
in the house since they married some 60 years ago.  In all, the nine petitioners
own 15 properties in Fort Trumbull--4 in parcel 3 of the development plan and 11
in parcel 4A.  Ten of the parcels are occupied by the owner or a family member;
the other five are held as investment properties.  There is no allegation that
any of these properties is blighted or otherwise in poor condition; rather, they
were condemned only because they happen to be located in the development area.

In December 2000, petitioners brought this action in the New London Superior
Court.  They claimed, among other things, that the taking of their properties
would violate the ""public use"" restriction in the Fifth Amendment.  After a
7-day bench trial, the Superior Court granted a permanent restraining order
prohibiting the taking of the properties located  [*476]  in parcel 4A (park or
marina support).  It,  however, denied petitioners relief as to the properties
located in parcel 3 (office space). App. to Pet. for Cert. 343-350. 4

4 While this litigation was pending before the Superior Court, the NLDC
announced that it would lease some of the parcels to private developers in
exchange for their agreement to develop the land according to the terms of the
development plan. Specifically, the NLDC was negotiating a 99-year ground lease
with Corcoran Jennison, a developer selected from a group of applicants.  The
negotiations contemplated a nominal rent of $1 per year, but no agreement had
yet been signed.  See 268 Conn. 1, 9, 61, 843 A.2d 500, 509-510, 540 (2004).

After the Superior Court ruled, both sides took appeals to the Supreme Court of
Connecticut.  That court held, over a dissent, that all of the City's proposed
takings were valid.  It began by upholding the lower court's determination that
the takings were authorized by chapter 132, the State's municipal development
statute.  See  Conn. Gen. Stat.  § 8-186 et seq (2005).   [HN3] That statute
expresses a legislative determination that the taking of land, even developed
land, as part of an economic development project is a ""public use"" and in the
""public interest.""  268 Conn., at 18-28, 843 A. 2d, at 515-521.  Next, relying
on cases such as Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229, 81 L. Ed. 2d
186, 104 S. Ct. 2321 (1984), and Berman v. Parker, 348 U.S. 26, 99 L. Ed. 27, 75
S. Ct. 98 (1954), the court held that such economic development qualified as a
valid public use under both the Federal and State Constitutions.  268 Conn., at
40, 843 A. 2d, at 527.

Finally, adhering to its precedents, the court went on to determine, first,
whether the takings of the particular properties at issue were ""reasonably
necessary"" to achieving the City's intended public use, id., at 82-84, 843 A.
2d, at 552-553, and, second, whether the takings were for ""reasonably [**2661]
foreseeable needs,"" id., at 93-94, 843 A. 2d, at 558-559.  The court upheld the
trial court's factual findings as to parcel 3, but reversed the trial court as
to parcel 4A, agreeing with the City that the intended use of this land was
sufficiently  [*477]  definite and had been given ""reasonable attention"" during
the planning process.  Id., at 120-121, 843 A. 2d, at 574.

[***450]  The three dissenting justices would have imposed a ""heightened""
standard of judicial review for takings justified by economic development.
Although they agreed that the plan was intended to serve a valid public use,
they would have found all the takings unconstitutional because the City had
failed to adduce ""clear and convincing evidence"" that the economic benefits of
the plan would in fact come to pass.  Id., at 144, 146, 843 A. 2d, at 587, 588
(Zarella, J., joined by Sullivan, C. J., and Katz, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part).

We granted certiorari to determine whether a city's decision to take property
for the purpose of economic development satisfies the ""public use"" requirement
of the Fifth Amendment. 542 U.S. 965, 159 L. Ed. 2d 857, 125 S. Ct. 27 (2004).

III

[***LEdHR3A]   [***LEdHR4A]  Two polar propositions are perfectly clear.   [HN4]
On the one hand, it has long been accepted that the sovereign may not take the
property of A for the sole purpose of transferring it to another private party B
, even though A is paid just compensation.  On the other hand, it is equally
clear that a State may transfer property from one private party to another if
future ""use by the public"" is the purpose of the taking; the condemnation of
land for a railroad with common-carrier duties is a familiar example.  Neither
of these propositions, however, determines the disposition of this case.

[***LEdHR3A]   [***LEdHR5] [5] As for the first proposition,  [HN5] the City
would no doubt be forbidden from taking petitioners' land for the purpose of
conferring a private benefit on a particular private party. See Midkiff, 467
U.S., at 245, 81 L. Ed. 2d 186, 104 S. Ct. 2321 (""A purely private taking could
not withstand the scrutiny of the public use requirement; it would serve no
legitimate purpose of government and would thus be void""); Missouri Pacific R.
Co. v. Nebraska, [*478]  164 U.S. 403, 41 L. Ed. 489, 17 S. Ct. 130 (1896). 5
Nor would the City be allowed to take property under the mere pretext of a
public purpose, when its actual purpose was to bestow a private benefit.  The
takings before us, however, would be executed pursuant to a ""carefully
considered"" development plan.  268 Conn., at 54, 843 A. 2d, at 536.  The trial
judge and all the members of the Supreme Court of Connecticut agreed that there
was no evidence of an illegitimate purpose in this case. 6 Therefore,  as was
true of the statute [**2662]  challenged in Midkiff, 467 U.S., at 245, 81 L. Ed.
2d 186,  [***451]  104 S. Ct. 2321, the City's development plan was not adopted
""to benefit a particular class of identifiable individuals.""

5 See also Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. 386, 3 Dall. 386, 1 L. Ed. 648 (1798) (""An act
of the Legislature (for I cannot call it a law) contrary to the great first
principles of the social compact, cannot be considered a rightful exercise of
legislative authority.  . . .  A few instances will suffice to explain what I
mean. . .  [A] law that takes property from A. and gives it to B: It is against
all reason and justice, for a people to entrust a Legislature with such powers;
and, therefore, it cannot be presumed that they have done it.  The genius, the
nature, and the spirit, of our State Governments, amount to a prohibition of
such acts of legislation; and the general principles of law and reason forbid
them"" (emphasis deleted)).

6 See 268 Conn., at 159, 843 A. 2d, at 595 (Zarella, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part) (""The record clearly demonstrates that the development plan
was not intended to serve the interests of Pfizer, Inc., or any other private
entity, but rather, to revitalize the local economy by creating temporary and
permanent jobs, generating a significant increase in tax revenue, encouraging
spin-off economic activities and maximizing public access to the waterfront"").
And while the City intends to transfer certain of the parcels to a private
developer in a long-term lease--which developer, in turn, is expected to lease
the office space and so forth to other private tenants--the identities of those
private parties were not known when the plan was adopted.  It is, of course,
difficult to accuse the government of having taken A's property to benefit the
private interests of B when the identity of B was unknown.

  [***LEdHR4A]  On the other hand, this is not a case in which the City is
planning to open the condemned land--at least not in its entirety--to use by the
general public. Nor will the private lessees of the land in any sense be
required to operate like common carriers, making their services available to all
comers.   [*479]  But although such a projected use would be sufficient to
satisfy the public use requirement,  [HN6] this ""Court long ago rejected any
literal requirement that condemned property be put into use for the general
public.""  Id., at 244, 81 L. Ed. 2d 186, 104 S. Ct. 2321.  Indeed, while many
state courts in the mid-19th century endorsed ""use by the public"" as the proper
definition of public use, that narrow view steadily eroded over time.  Not only
was the ""use by the public"" test difficult to administer (e.g., what proportion
of the public need have access to the property?  at what price?), 7 but it
proved to be impractical given the diverse and always evolving needs of society.
8 Accordingly,  [*480]  when this Court began applying the Fifth Amendment to
the States at the close of the 19th century, it embraced the broader and more
natural interpretation of public use as ""public purpose."" See, e.g.,   Fallbrook
Irrigation Dist. v. Bradley, 164 U.S. 112, 158-164, 41 L. Ed. 369, 17 S. Ct. 56
(1896).  Thus, in a case upholding a mining company's use of an aerial bucket
line to transport ore over property it did not own, Justice Holmes' opinion for
the Court stressed ""the inadequacy of use by the general public as a  [**2663]
universal test.""   Strickley v. Highland Boy Gold Mining Co., 200 U.S. 527, 531,
50 L.  [***452]  Ed. 581, 26 S. Ct. 301 (1906). 9 We have repeatedly and
consistently rejected that narrow test ever since. 10

7 See, e.g.,  Dayton Gold & Silver Mining Co. v. Seawell, 11 Nev. 394, 410, 1876
WL 4573, *11 (1876) (""If public occupation and enjoyment of the object for which
land is to be condemned furnishes the only and true test for the right of
eminent domain, then the legislature would certainly have the constitutional
authority to condemn the lands of any private citizen for the purpose of
building hotels and theaters.  Why not?  A hotel is used by the public as much
as a railroad.  The public have the same right, upon payment of a fixed
compensation, to seek rest and refreshment at a public inn as they have to
travel upon a railroad"").

8 From upholding the Mill Acts (which authorized manufacturers dependent on
power-producing dams to flood upstream lands in exchange for just compensation),
to approving takings necessary for the economic development of the West through
mining and irrigation, many state courts either circumvented the ""use by the
public"" test when necessary or abandoned it completely.  See Nichols, The
Meaning of Public Use in the Law of Eminent Domain, 20 B.U.L. Rev. 615, 619-624
(1940) (tracing this development and collecting cases).  For example, in
rejecting the ""use by the public"" test as overly restrictive, the Nevada Supreme
Court stressed that ""[m]ining is the greatest of the industrial pursuits in this
state.  All other interests are subservient to it.  Our mountains are almost
barren of timber, and our valleys could never be made profitable for
agricultural purposes except for the fact of a home market having been created
by the mining developments in different sections of the state.  The mining and
milling interests give employment to many men, and the benefits derived from
this business are distributed as much, and sometimes more, among the laboring
classes than with the owners of the mines and mills. . . .  The present
prosperity of the state is entirely due to the mining developments already made,
and the entire people of the state are directly interested in having the future
developments unobstructed by the obstinate action of any individual or
individuals.""  Dayton Gold & Silver Mining Co., 11 Nev., at 409-410, 1876 WL, at

The disposition of this case therefore turns on the question whether the City's
development plan serves a ""public purpose.""  [HN7] Without exception, our cases
have defined that concept broadly, reflecting our longstanding policy of
deference to legislative judgments in this field.

In Berman v. Parker, 348 U.S. 26, 99 L. Ed. 27, 75 S. Ct. 98 (1954), this Court
upheld a redevelopment plan targeting a blighted area of Washington, D. C., in
which most of the housing for the area's 5,000 inhabitants was beyond repair.
Under the plan, the area would be condemned and part of it utilized for the
construction of streets, schools, and other public facilities.  The remainder of
the land would be leased or sold to private parties for the purpose of
redevelopment, including the construction of low-cost housing.

[*481]  The owner of a department store located in the area challenged the
condemnation, pointing out that his store was not itself blighted and arguing
that the creation of a ""better balanced, more attractive community"" was not a
valid public use.  Id., at 31, 99 L. Ed. 27, 75 S. Ct. 98.  Writing for a
unanimous Court, Justice Douglas refused to evaluate this claim in isolation,
deferring instead to the legislative and agency judgment that the area ""must be
planned as a whole"" for the plan to be successful.  Id., at 34, 99 L. Ed. 27, 75
S. Ct. 98.  The Court explained that  [HN8] ""community redevelopment programs
need not, by force of the Constitution, be on a piecemeal basis--lot by lot,
building by building.""  Id., at 35, 99 L. Ed. 27, 75 S. Ct. 98.  The public use
underlying the taking was unequivocally affirmed:


      [HN9] ""We do not sit to determine whether a particular housing
     project is or is not desirable.  The concept of the public welfare is
     broad and inclusive.  . . .  The values it represents are spiritual as
     well as physical, aesthetic as well as monetary.  It is within the
     power of the legislature to determine that the community should be
     beautiful as well as healthy, spacious as well as clean, well-balanced
     as well as carefully patrolled.  In the present case, the Congress and
     its authorized agencies have made determinations that take into
     account a wide variety of values.  It is not for us to reappraise
     them.  If those who govern the District of Columbia decide that the
     Nation's Capital should be beautiful as well as sanitary, there is
     nothing in the Fifth Amendment that stands in the way.""  Id., at 33,
     99 L. Ed. 27, 75 S. Ct. 98.



In Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229, 81 L. Ed. 2d 186, 104 S.
Ct. 2321 (1984), the Court considered a Hawaii statute whereby fee title was
taken from lessors and transferred to lessees (for  [***453]  just compensation)
in order to reduce the concentration of land ownership.  We unanimously upheld
the statute and rejected the Ninth Circuit's view that it was ""a naked attempt
on the part of the state of Hawaii to take the property of A  [*482]  and
[**2664]  transfer it to B solely for B's private use and benefit.""  Id., at
235, 81 L. Ed. 2d 186, 104 S. Ct. 2321 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Reaffirming Berman's deferential approach to legislative judgments in this
field, we concluded that the State's purpose of eliminating the ""social and
economic evils of a land oligopoly"" qualified as a valid public use.  467 U.S.,
at 241-242, 81 L. Ed. 2d 186, 104 S. Ct. 2321.   [HN10] Our opinion also
rejected the contention that the mere fact that the State immediately
transferred the properties to private individuals upon condemnation somehow
diminished the public character of the taking.  ""[I]t is only the taking's
purpose, and not its mechanics,"" we explained, that matters in determining
public use.  Id., at 244, 81 L. Ed. 2d 186, 104 S. Ct. 2321.

In that same Term we decided another public use case that arose in a purely
economic context.  In Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986, 81 L. Ed. 2d
815, 104 S. Ct. 2862 (1984), the Court dealt with provisions of the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act under which the Environmental
Protection Agency could consider the data (including trade secrets) submitted by
a prior pesticide applicant in evaluating a subsequent application, so long as
the second applicant paid just compensation for the data.  We acknowledged that
the ""most direct beneficiaries"" of these provisions were the subsequent
applicants, id., at 1014, 81 L. Ed. 2d 815, 104 S. Ct. 2862, but we nevertheless
upheld the statute under Berman and Midkiff. We found sufficient Congress'
belief that sparing applicants the cost of time-consuming research eliminated a
significant barrier to entry in the pesticide market and thereby enhanced
competition.  467 U.S., at 1015, 81 L. Ed. 2d 815, 104 S. Ct. 2862.

[HN11] Viewed as a whole, our jurisprudence has recognized that the needs of
society have varied between different parts of the Nation, just as they have
evolved over time in response to changed circumstances.  Our earliest cases in
particular embodied a strong theme of federalism, emphasizing the ""great
respect"" that we owe to state legislatures and state courts in discerning local
public needs.  See Hairston v. Danville & Western R. Co., 208 U.S. 598, 606-607,
52 L. Ed. 637, 28 S. Ct. 331 (1908)  [*483]  (noting that these needs were
likely to vary depending on a State's ""resources, the capacity of the soil, the
relative importance of industries to the general public welfare, and the
long-established methods and habits of the people""). 11 For more than a century,
our public use jurisprudence  [***454]  has wisely eschewed rigid formulas and
intrusive scrutiny in favor of affording legislatures broad latitude in
determining what public needs justify the use of the takings power.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR6] [6] Those who govern the City were not confronted
with the need to remove blight [**2665]  in the Fort Trumbull area, but their
determination that the area was sufficiently distressed to justify a program of
economic rejuvenation is entitled to our deference. The City has carefully
formulated an economic development plan that it believes will provide
appreciable benefits to the community, including--but by no means limited
to--new jobs and increased tax revenue. As with other exercises in urban
planning and development, 12 the City is endeavoring to coordinate a variety of
commercial, residential, and recreational uses of land, with the hope that they
will form a whole greater than the sum of its parts.  To effectuate  [*484]
this plan, the City has invoked a state statute that specifically authorizes the
use of eminent domain to promote economic development. Given the comprehensive
character of the plan, the thorough deliberation that preceded its adoption, and
the limited scope of our review, it is appropriate for us, as it was in Berman,
to resolve the challenges of the individual owners, not on a piecemeal basis,
but rather in light of the entire plan.  Because that plan unquestionably serves
a public purpose, the takings challenged here satisfy the public use requirement
of the Fifth Amendment.

 [***LEdHR7] [7] To avoid this result, petitioners urge us to adopt a new
bright-line rule that economic development does not qualify as a public use.
Putting aside the unpersuasive suggestion that the City's plan will provide only
purely economic benefits, neither precedent nor logic supports petitioners'
proposal.   [HN12] Promoting economic development is a traditional and
long-accepted function of government.  There is, moreover, no principled way of
distinguishing economic development from the other public purposes that we have
recognized.  In our cases upholding takings that facilitated agriculture and
mining, for example, we emphasized the importance of those industries to the
welfare of the States in question, see, e.g.,  Strickley, 200 U.S. 527, 50 L.

The traditional means by which consumers in the United States access the network
of interconnected computers that make up the Internet is through ""dial-up""
connections provided over local telephone facilities.  See 345 F.3d 1120,
1123-1124 (CA9 2003) (cases below); In re Inquiry Concerning High-Speed Access
to the Internet Over Cable and Other Facilities, 17 FCC Rcd. 4798, 4802-4803, P9
(2002) (hereinafter Declaratory Ruling).  Using these connections, consumers
access the Internet by making calls with computer modems through the telephone
wires owned by local phone companies.  See Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC,
535 U.S. 467, 489-490, 152 L. Ed. 2d 701, 122 S. Ct. 1646 (2002) (describing the
physical structure  [***834]  of a local telephone exchange).  Internet service
providers (ISPs), in turn, link those calls to the Internet network, [**2696]
not only by providing a physical connection, but also by offering consumers the
ability to translate raw Internet data into information they may both view on
their personal computers and transmit to other computers connected to the
Internet.  See In re Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, 13 FCC Rcd.
11501, 11531, P63 (1998) (hereinafter Universal Service Report or Report); P.
Huber, M. Kellogg, & J. Thorne, Federal Telecommunications Law 988 (2d ed. 1999)
(hereinafter Huber); 345 F.3d at 1123-1124.  Technological limitations of local
telephone wires, however, retard the speed at which data from the Internet may
be transmitted  [*975]  through end users' dial-up connections.  Dial-up
connections are therefore known as ""narrowband,"" or slower speed, connections.

""Broadband"" Internet service, by contrast, transmits data at much higher speeds.
There are two principal kinds of broadband Internet service: cable modem service
and Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) service.  Cable modem service transmits data
between the Internet and users' computers via the network of television cable
lines owned by cable companies.  See id., at 1124. DSL service provides
high-speed access using the local telephone wires owned by local telephone
companies.  See WorldCom, Inc. v. FCC, 246 F.3d 690, 692 (CADC 2001) (describing
DSL technology).  Cable companies and telephone companies can either provide
Internet access directly to consumers, thus acting as ISPs themselves, or can
lease their transmission facilities to independent ISPs that then use the
facilities to provide consumers with Internet access.  Other ways of
transmitting high-speed Internet data into homes, including terrestrial- and
satellite-based wireless networks, are also emerging.  Declaratory Ruling 4802,
P6.

II

At issue in these cases is the proper regulatory classification under the
Communications Act of broadband cable Internet service.   [HN2] The Act, as
amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 56, defines two
categories of regulated entities relevant to these cases: telecommunications
carriers and information-service providers. The Act regulates telecommunications
carriers, but not information-service providers, as common carriers.
Telecommunications carriers, for example, must charge just and reasonable,
nondiscriminatory rates to their customers, 47 U.S.C. §§ 201-209, design their
systems so that other carriers can interconnect with their communications
networks, § 251(a)(1), and contribute to the federal ""universal service"" fund, §
254(d).   [*976]  These provisions are mandatory, but the Commission must
forbear from applying them if it determines that the public interest requires
it.  §§ 160(a), (b).  Information-service providers, by contrast, are not
subject to mandatory common-carrier regulation under Title II, though the
Commission has jurisdiction to impose additional regulatory obligations under
its Title I ancillary jurisdiction to regulate interstate and foreign
communications, see §§ 151-161.

These two statutory classifications originated in the late 1970's, as the
Commission developed rules to regulate  [***835]  data-processing services
offered over telephone wires. That regime, the ""Computer II"" rules,
distinguished between ""basic"" service (like telephone service) and ""enhanced""
service (computer-processing service offered over telephone lines).  In re
Amendment of Section 64.702 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations (Second
Computer Inquiry), 77 F.C.C. 2d 384, 417-423, PP86-101 (1980) (hereinafter
Computer II Order).  The Computer II rules defined both basic and enhanced
services [**2697]  by reference to how the consumer perceives the service being
offered.

In particular, the Commission defined ""basic service"" as ""a pure transmission
capability over a communications path that is virtually transparent in terms of
its interaction with customer supplied information."" Id., at 420, P96.  By
""pure"" or ""transparent"" transmission, the Commission meant a communications path
that enabled the consumer to transmit an ordinary-language message to another
point, with no computer processing or storage of the information, other than the
processing or storage needed to convert the message into electronic form and
then back into ordinary language for purposes of transmitting it over the
network--such as via a telephone or a facsimile.  Id., at 419-420, PP94-95.
Basic service was subject to common-carrier regulation. Id., at 428, P114.

""[E]nhanced service,"" however, was service in which ""computer processing
applications [were] used to act on the  [*977]  content, code, protocol, and
other aspects of the subscriber's information,"" such as voice and data storage
services, id., at 420-421, P97, as well as ""protocol conversion"" (i.e., ability
to communicate between networks that employ different data-transmission
formats), id., at 421-422, P99.  By contrast to basic service, the Commission
decided not to subject providers of enhanced service, even enhanced service
offered via transmission wires, to Title II common-carrier regulation. Id., at
428-432, PP115-123.  The Commission explained that it was unwise to subject
enhanced service to common-carrier regulation given the ""fast-moving,
competitive market"" in which they were offered.  Id., at 434, P129.

The definitions of the terms ""telecommunications service"" and ""information
service"" established by the 1996 Act are similar to the Computer II basic- and
enhanced-service classifications.  ""Telecommunications service""--the analog to
basic service--is ""the offering of telecommunications for a fee directly to the
public . . . regardless of the facilities used."" 47 U.S.C. § 153(46).
""Telecommunications"" is ""the transmission, between or among points specified by
the user, of information of the user's choosing, without change in the form or
content of the information as sent and received."" § 153(43).
""Telecommunications carrier[s]""--those subjected to mandatory Title II
common-carrier regulation--are defined as ""provider[s] of telecommunications
services."" § 153(44).  And ""information service""--the analog to enhanced
service--is ""the offering of a capability for generating, acquiring, storing,
transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information
via telecommunications . . . ."" § 153(20).

In September 2000, the Commission initiated a rulemaking proceeding to, among
other things, apply these classifications to cable companies that offer
broadband Internet  [***836]  service directly to consumers. In March 2002, that
rulemaking culminated in the Declaratory Ruling under review in these cases.  In
the Declaratory Ruling, the Commission concluded  [*978]  that broadband
Internet service provided by cable companies is an ""information service"" but not
a ""telecommunications service"" under the Act, and therefore not subject to
mandatory Title II common-carrier regulation. In support of this conclusion, the
Commission relied heavily on its Universal Service Report. See Declaratory
Ruling 4821-4822, PP36-37 (citing Universal Service Report).  The Universal
Service Report classified ""non-facilities-based"" ISPs--those that do not own the
transmission facilities they use to connect the end user to the Internet--solely
as information-service [**2698]  providers. See Universal Service Report 11533,
P67.  Unlike those ISPs, cable companies own the cable lines they use to provide
Internet access.  Nevertheless, in the Declaratory Ruling, the Commission found
no basis in the statutory definitions for treating cable companies differently
from non-facilities-based ISPs: Both offer ""a single, integrated service that
enables the subscriber to utilize Internet access service . . . and to realize
the benefits of a comprehensive service offering."" Declaratory Ruling 4823, P38.
Because Internet access provides a capability for manipulating and storing
information, the Commission concluded that it was an information service. Ibid.

The integrated nature of Internet access and the high-speed wire used to provide
Internet access led the Commission to conclude that cable companies providing
Internet access are not telecommunications providers. This conclusion, the
Commission reasoned, followed from the logic of the Universal Service Report.
The Report had concluded that, though Internet service ""involves data transport
elements"" because ""an Internet access provider must enable the movement of
information between customers' own computers and distant computers with which
those customers seek to interact,"" it also ""offers end users information-service
capabilities inextricably intertwined with data transport."" Universal Service
Report 11539-11540, P80.  ISPs, therefore, were not ""offering . . .
telecommunications . . . directly to the public,""  [*979]  § 153(46), and so
were not properly classified as telecommunications carriers, see id., at 11540,
P81.  In other words, the Commission reasoned that consumers use their cable
modems not to transmit information ""transparently,"" such as by using a
telephone, but instead to obtain Internet access.

The Commission applied this same reasoning to cable companies offering broadband
Internet access.  Its logic was that, like non-facilities-based ISPs, cable
companies do not ""offe[r] telecommunications service to the end user, but rather
. . . merely us[e] telecommunications to provide end users with cable modem
service."" Declaratory Ruling 4824, P41.  Though the Commission declined to apply
mandatory Title II common-carrier regulation to cable companies, it invited
comment on whether under its Title I jurisdiction it should require cable
companies to offer other ISPs access to their facilities on common-carrier
terms.  Id., at 4839, P72.  Numerous parties petitioned for judicial review,
challenging the Commission's conclusion that cable modem service was not
telecommunications  [***837]  service.  By judicial lottery, the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit was selected as the venue for the challenge.

The Court of Appeals granted the petitions in part, vacated the Declaratory
Ruling in part, and remanded to the Commission for further proceedings.  In
particular, the Court of Appeals vacated the ruling to the extent it concluded
that cable modem service was not ""telecommunications service"" under the
Communications Act. It held that the Commission could not permissibly construe
the Communications Act to exempt cable companies providing Internet service from
Title II regulation. See 345 F.3d at 1132.  Rather than analyzing the
permissibility of that construction under the deferential framework of Chevron,
467 U.S. 837, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694, 104 S. Ct. 2778, however, the Court of Appeals
grounded its holding in the stare decisis effect of AT&T Corp. v. Portland, 216
F.3d 871 (CA9 2000).  See 345 F.3d, at 1128-1132.  Portland held that cable
modem service was a ""telecommunications service,""  [*980]  though the court in
that case was not reviewing an administrative proceeding [**2699]  and the
Commission was not a party to the case.  See 216 F.3d, at 877-880.
Nevertheless, Portland's holding, the Court of Appeals reasoned, overrode the
contrary interpretation reached by the Commission in the Declaratory Ruling. See
345 F.3d, at 1130-1131.

We granted certiorari to settle the important questions of federal law that
these cases present.  543 U.S. 1018, 160 L. Ed. 2d 494, 125 S. Ct. 654 (2004).

III

[***LEdHR1A] [1B] We first consider whether we should apply Chevron's framework
to the Commission's interpretation of the term ""telecommunications service."" We
conclude that we should.  We also conclude that the Court of Appeals should have
done the same, instead of following the contrary construction it adopted in
Portland

A

[***LEdHR2A] [2A]  [***LEdHR3A] [3A] In Chevron, this Court held that  [HN3]
ambiguities in statutes within an agency's jurisdiction to administer are
delegations of authority to the agency to fill the statutory gap in reasonable
fashion.  Filling these gaps, the Court explained, involves difficult policy
choices that agencies are better equipped to make than courts.  467 U.S., at
865-866, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694, 104 S. Ct. 2778.  If a statute is ambiguous, and if
the implementing agency's construction is reasonable, Chevron requires a federal
court to accept the agency's construction of the statute, even if the agency's
reading differs from what the court believes is the best statutory
interpretation.  Id., at 843-844, and n. 11, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694, 104 S. Ct. 2778.

[***LEdHR2A] [2B] The Chevron framework governs our review of the Commission's
construction.   [HN4] Congress has delegated to the Commission the authority to
""execute and enforce"" the Communications Act, § 151, and to ""prescribe such
rules and regulations as may be necessary in the public interest to carry out
the provisions"" of the Act, § 201(b); AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utilities Bd., 525 U.S.
366, 377-378, 142 L. Ed. 2d 834, 119 S. Ct. 721 (1999).  These provisions give
the Commission the authority to promulgate  [*981]  binding legal rules; the
Commission issued the order under review in the exercise of that authority; and
no one  [***838]  questions that the order is within the Commission's
jurisdiction.  See Household Credit Services, Inc. v. Pfennig, 541 U.S. 232,
238-239, 158 L. Ed. 2d 450, 124 S. Ct. 1741 (2004); United States v. Mead Corp.,
533 U.S. 218, 231-234, 150 L. Ed. 2d 292, 121 S. Ct. 2164 (2001); Christensen v.
Harris County, 529 U.S. 576, 586-588, 146 L. Ed. 2d 621, 120 S. Ct. 1655 (2000).
Hence, as we have in the past, we apply the Chevron framework to the
Commission's interpretation of the Communications Act. See Nat'l Cable &
Telecomms. Ass'n v. Gulf Power Co., 534 U.S. 327, 333-339, 151 L. Ed. 2d 794,
122 S. Ct. 782 (2002); Verizon, 535 U.S., at 501-502, 152 L. Ed. 2d 701, 122 S.
Ct. 1646.

[***LEdHR4] [4] Some of the respondents dispute this conclusion, on the ground
that the Commission's interpretation is inconsistent with its past practice.  We
reject this argument.   [HN5] Agency inconsistency is not a basis for declining
to analyze the agency's interpretation under the Chevron framework.  Unexplained
inconsistency is, at most, a reason for holding an interpretation to be an
arbitrary and capricious change from agency practice under the Administrative
Procedure Act.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,
463 U.S. 29, 46-57, 77 L. Ed. 2d 443, 103 S. Ct. 2856 (1983). For if the agency
adequately explains the reasons for a reversal of policy, ""change is not
invalidating, since the whole point of Chevron is to leave the discretion
provided by the ambiguities [**2700]  of a statute with the implementing
agency."" Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U.S. 735, 742, 135 L. Ed.
2d 25, 116 S. Ct. 1730 (1996); see also Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 186-187,
114 L. Ed. 2d 233, 111 S. Ct. 1759 (1991); Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U.S. 212,
226, 152 L. Ed. 2d 330, 122 S. Ct. 1265 (2002) (Scalia, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment).  ""An initial agency interpretation is not instantly
carved in stone.  On the contrary, the agency . . . must consider varying
interpretations and the wisdom of its policy on a continuing basis,"" Chevron,
supra, at 863-864, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694, 104 S. Ct. 2778, for example, in response
to changed factual circumstances, or a change in administrations, see State Farm
, supra, at 59, 77 L. Ed. 2d 443, 103 S. Ct. 2856 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in
part and dissenting in part).  That is no doubt why  [*982]  in Chevron itself,
this Court deferred to an agency interpretation that was a recent reversal of
agency policy.  See 467 U.S., at 857-858, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694, 104 S. Ct. 2778.  We
therefore have no difficulty concluding that  Chevron applies.

B

[***LEdHR5A] [5A] The Court of Appeals declined to apply Chevron because it
thought the Commission's interpretation of the Communications Act foreclosed by
the conflicting construction of the Act it had adopted in Portland. See 345
F.3d, at 1127-1132.  It based that holding on the assumption that Portland's
construction overrode the Commission's, regardless of whether Portland had held
the statute to be unambiguous.  345 F.3d, at 1131.  That reasoning was
incorrect.

[HN6]  [***LEdHR5A] [5B]  [***LEdHR6] [6] A court's prior judicial construction
of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to Chevron
deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows
from the unambiguous  [***839]  terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for
agency discretion.  This principle follows from Chevron itself.   [HN7] Chevron
established a ""presumption that Congress, when it left ambiguity in a statute
meant for implementation by an agency, understood that the ambiguity would be
resolved, first and foremost, by the agency, and desired the agency (rather than
the courts) to possess whatever degree of discretion the ambiguity allows.""
Smiley, supra, at 740-741, 135 L. Ed. 25, 116 S. Ct. 1730. Yet allowing a
judicial precedent to foreclose an agency from interpreting an ambiguous
statute, as the Court of Appeals assumed it could, would allow a court's
interpretation to override an agency's.   [HN8] Chevron's premise is that it is
for agencies, not courts, to fill statutory gaps.  See 467 U.S., at 843-844, and
n. 11, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694, 104 S. Ct. 2778.  The better rule is to hold judicial
interpretations contained in precedents to the same demanding Chevron step one
standard that applies if the court is reviewing the agency's construction on a
blank slate: Only a judicial precedent holding that the statute  [*983]
unambiguously forecloses the agency's interpretation, and therefore contains no
gap for the agency to fill, displaces a conflicting agency construction.

[***LEdHR5A] [5C]  [***LEdHR7] [7] A contrary rule would produce anomalous
results.  It would mean that whether an agency's interpretation of an ambiguous
statute is entitled to Chevron deference would turn on the order in which the
interpretations issue: If the court's construction came first, its construction
would prevail, whereas if the agency's came first, the agency's construction
would command Chevron deference. Yet  [HN9] whether Congress has delegated to an
agency the authority to interpret a statute does not depend on the order in
which the judicial and administrative constructions occur.  The Court of
Appeals' rule, moreover, would ""lead to the ossification of large portions of
our statutory law,"" Mead, 533 U.S., at 247, 150 L. Ed. 2d 292,  [**2701]  121 S.
Ct. 2164 (Scalia, J., dissenting), by precluding agencies from revising unwise
judicial constructions of ambiguous statutes.  Neither Chevron nor the doctrine
of stare decisis requires these haphazard results.

[***LEdHR5A] [5D] The dissent answers that allowing an agency to override what a
court believes to be the best interpretation of a statute makes ""judicial
decisions subject to reversal by executive officers."" Post, at 1016, 162 L. Ed.
2d, at 860 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  It does not.  Since  [HN10] Chevron teaches
that a court's opinion as to the best reading of an ambiguous statute an agency
is charged with administering is not authoritative, the agency's decision to
construe that statute differently from a court does not say that the court's
holding was legally wrong.  Instead, the agency may, consistent with the court's
holding, choose a different construction, since the agency remains the
authoritative interpreter (within the limits of reason) of such statutes.  In
all other respects, the court's prior ruling remains binding law (for example,
as to agency interpretations to which Chevron is inapplicable).  The precedent
has not been ""reversed"" by the agency, any more than a federal court's
interpretation of a State's law can be said to have been ""reversed"" by a  [*984]
state court that adopts a conflicting (yet authoritative) interpretation of
state law.

The Court of Appeals derived a  [***840]  contrary rule from a mistaken reading
of this Court's decisions.  It read Neal v. United States, 516 U.S. 284, 133 L.
Ed. 2d 709, 116 S. Ct. 763 (1996), to establish that a prior judicial
construction of a statute categorically controls an agency's contrary
construction.  345 F.3d, at 1131-1132; see also post, at 1016, n 11, 162 L. Ed.
2d, at 860 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Neal established no such proposition.
Neal declined to defer to a construction adopted by the United States Sentencing
Commission that conflicted with one the Court previously had adopted in Chapman
v. United States, 500 U.S. 453, 114 L. Ed. 2d 524, 111 S. Ct. 1919 (1991).  Neal
, supra, at 290-295, 133 L. Ed. 2d 709, 116 S. Ct. 763.  Chapman, however, had
held the relevant statute to be unambiguous.  See 500 U.S., at 463, 114 L. Ed.
2d 524, 111 S. Ct. 1919 (declining to apply the rule of lenity given the
statute's clear language).  Thus,  [HN11] Neal established only that a precedent
holding a statute to be unambiguous forecloses a contrary agency construction.
That limited holding accorded with this Court's prior decisions, which had held
that a court's interpretation of a statute trumps an agency's under the doctrine
of stare decisis only if the prior court holding ""determined a statute's clear
meaning."" Maislin Industries, U.S., Inc. v. Primary Steel, Inc., 497 U.S. 116,
131, 111 L. Ed. 2d 94, 110 S. Ct. 2759 (1990) (emphasis added); see also
Lechmere, Inc. v. NLRB, 502 U.S. 527, 536-537, 117 L. Ed. 2d 79, 112 S. Ct. 841
(1992).  Those decisions allow a court's prior interpretation of a statute to
override an agency's interpretation only if the relevant court decision held the
statute unambiguous.

Against this background, the Court of Appeals erred in refusing to apply Chevron
to the Commission's interpretation of the definition of ""telecommunications
service,"" 47 U.S.C. § 153(46).  Its prior decision in Portland held only that
the best reading of § 153(46) was that cable modem service was a
""telecommunications service,  "" not that it was the only permissible reading of
the statute.  See 216 F.3d, at 877-880.  Nothing in Portland held that the
Communications  [*985]  Act unambiguously required treating cable Internet
providers as telecommunications carriers. Instead, the court noted that it was
""not presented with a case involving potential deference to an administrative
agency's statutory construction pursuant to the Chevron doctrine,""  [**2702]
id., at 876; and the court invoked no other rule of construction (such as the
rule of lenity) requiring it to conclude that the statute was unambiguous to
reach its judgment.   [HN12] Before a judicial construction of a statute,
whether contained in a precedent or not, may trump an agency's, the court must
hold that the statute unambiguously requires the court's construction.  Portland
did not do so.

[***LEdHR8] [8] As the dissent points out, it is not logically necessary for us
to reach the question whether the Court of Appeals misapplied Chevron for us to
decide whether the Commission acted lawfully.  See post, at 1019-1020, 162 L.
Ed. 2d, at 862 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  Nevertheless, it is no ""great mystery""
why we are reaching the point here.  Post, at 1019, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 862. There
is genuine confusion in the lower courts over the interaction between the
Chevron doctrine and stare decisis principles, as the petitioners informed us at
the certiorari stage of this litigation.  See Pet. for Cert. of  [***841]
Federal Communications Commission et al. in No. 04-281, pp 19-23; Pet. for Cert.
of National Cable & Telecomm. Assn. et al. in No. 04-277, pp 22-29.  The point
has been briefed.  See Brief for Federal Petitioners 38-44; Brief for
Cable-Industry Petitioners 30-36.  And not reaching the point could undermine
the purpose of our grant of certiorari: to settle authoritatively whether the
Commission's Declaratory Ruling is lawful.  Were we to uphold the Declaratory
Ruling without reaching the Chevron point, the Court of Appeals could once again
strike down the Commission's rule based on its Portland decision.  Portland (at
least arguably) could compel the Court of Appeals once again to reverse the
Commission despite our decision, since our conclusion that it is reasonable to
read the Communications Act to classify cable modem service solely as an
""information  [*986]  service"" leaves untouched Portland's holding that the
Commission's interpretation is not the best reading of the statute.  We have
before decided similar questions that were not, strictly speaking, necessary to
our disposition.  See, e.g., Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237, 138 L. Ed.
2d 391, 117 S. Ct. 1997 (1997) (requiring  [HN13] the Courts of Appeals to
adhere to our directly controlling precedents, even those that rest on reasons
rejected in other decisions); Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 628-629, 161 L.
Ed. 2d 1, 125 S. Ct. 1183 (2005) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (criticizing this
Court for not reaching the question whether the Missouri Supreme Court erred by
failing to follow directly controlling Supreme Court precedent, though that
conclusion was not necessary to the Court's decision).  It is prudent for us to
do so once again today.

IV

[***LEdHR1A] [1C]  [***LEdHR3A] [3B] We next address whether the Commission's
construction of the definition of ""telecommunications service,"" 47 U.S.C. §
153(46), is a permissible reading of the Communications Act under the Chevron
framework.   [HN14] Chevron established a familiar two-step procedure for
evaluating whether an agency's interpretation of a statute is lawful.  At the
first step, we ask whether the statute's plain terms ""directly addres[s] the
precise question at issue."" 467 U.S., at 843, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694, 104 S. Ct. 2778.
If the statute is ambiguous on the point, we defer at step two to the agency's
interpretation so long as the construction is ""a reasonable policy choice for
the agency to make."" Id., at 845, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694, 104 S. Ct. 2778.  The
Commission's interpretation is permissible at both steps.

A

[***LEdHR9] [9] We first set forth our understanding of the interpretation of
the Communications Act that the Commission embraced.  The issue before the
Commission was whether cable companies providing cable [**2703]  modem service
are providing a ""telecommunications service"" in addition to an ""information
service.""

[*987]  The Commission first concluded that cable modem service is an
""information service,"" a conclusion unchallenged here.  The Act defines  [HN15]
""information service"" as ""the offering of a capability for generating,
acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making
available information via telecommunications . . . ."" § 153(20).  Cable modem
service is an information service, the Commission reasoned, because it provides
consumers with a comprehensive capability for manipulating  [***842]
information using the Internet via high-speed telecommunications. That service
enables users, for example, to browse the World Wide Web,  to transfer files
from file archives available on the Internet via the ""File Transfer Protocol,""
and to access e-mail and Usenet newsgroups.  Declaratory Ruling 4821, P37;
Universal Service Report 11537, P76.  Like other forms of Internet service,
cable modem service also gives users access to the Domain Name System (DNS).
DNS, among other things, matches the Web page addresses that end users type into
their browsers (or ""click"" on) with the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses 1 of
the servers containing the Web pages the users wish to access.  Declaratory
Ruling 4821-4822, P37.  All of these features, the Commission concluded, were
part of the informa"

 [*373]   [**720]   [***742]  Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A]  [***LEdHR2A] [2A]  [***LEdHR3A] [3A]  [HN1] An alien arriving
in the United States must be inspected by an immigration official, 66 Stat 198,
as amended, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(a)(3), and, unless he is found ""clearly and beyond a
doubt entitled to be admitted,"" must generally undergo removal proceedings to
determine admissibility, § 1225(b)(2)(A).  Meanwhile the alien may be detained,
subject to the Secretary's discretionary authority to parole him into the
country.  See § 1182(d)(5) ; 8 C.F.R. § 212.5 (2004).  If, at the conclusion of
removal proceedings, the alien is determined to be inadmissible and ordered
removed, the law provides that the Secretary of Homeland Security ""shall remove
the alien from the United States within a period of 90 days,"" 8 U.S.C. §
1231(a)(1)(A).  These cases concern the Secretary's authority to continue to
detain an inadmissible alien subject to a removal order after the 90-day removal
period has elapsed.

Martinez (respondent in No. 03-878) and Daniel Benitez (petitioner in No.

Mariel boatlift, see  Palma v. Verdeyen, 676 F.2d 100, 101 (CA4 1982)
(describing circumstances of Mariel boatlift), and were paroled into the country
pursuant to the Attorney General's authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5). 1 See
Pet. for Cert. in No. 03-878, p 7;   Benitez v. Wallis, 337 F.3d 1289, 1290
(CA11 2003).  Until 1996, federal law permitted Cubans who were paroled into the
United States to adjust their status to that of lawful permanent resident after
one year.  See Cuban Refugee Adjustment Act, 80 Stat 1161, as amended, notes
following 8 USC § 1255.  Neither Martinez nor Benitez qualified for this
adjustment, however, because, by the time they applied, both men had become
inadmissible because of prior criminal convictions in the United States.  When
Martinez sought adjustment in 1991, he had been convicted of assault with a
deadly weapon in Rhode Island and burglary in California, Pet. for Cert. in No.
03-878, at 7; when Benitez sought adjustment in 1985, he had been convicted of
grand theft in Florida,  337 F.3d, at 1290.  Both men were convicted of
additional felonies after their adjustment applications were denied: Martinez of
petty theft with a prior conviction (1996), assault with a deadly weapon (1998),
and attempted oral copulation by force (1999), see Pet. for Cert. in No. 03-878,
at 7-8; Benitez of two counts of armed robbery,  armed burglary of a conveyance,
armed burglary of a structure,  [**721]  aggravated battery, carrying a
concealed firearm,  [*375]  unlawful possession of a firearm while engaged in a
criminal offense, and unlawful  [***743]  possession, sale, or delivery of a
firearm with an altered serial number (1993), see  337 F.3d, at 1290-1291.

The Attorney General revoked Martinez's parole in December 2000.  Martinez was
taken into custody by the INS, and removal proceedings were commenced against
him.  Pet. for Cert. in No. 03-878, at 8.  An Immigration Judge found him
inadmissible by reason of his prior convictions, § 1182(a)(2)(B), and lack of
sufficient documentation, § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), and ordered him removed to
Cuba.  Martinez did not appeal.  Pet. for Cert. in No. 03-878, at 8.  The INS
continued to detain him after expiration of the 90-day removal period, and he
remained in custody until he was released pursuant to the District Court order
that was affirmed by the Court of Appeals' decision on review here.  Id., at 9.

[***LEdHR2A] [2D]  [***LEdHR4A] [4A] Benitez's parole was revoked in 1993
(shortly after he was imprisoned for his convictions of that year), and the INS
immediately initiated removal proceedings against him.  In December 1994, an
Immigration Judge determined Benitez to be excludable and ordered him deported
under §§ 1182(a)(2)(B) and 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) (1994 ed. and Supp V). 2   337
F.3d, at 1291.  Benitez did not seek further review.  At the completion of his
state prison term, the INS took him into custody for removal, and he continued
in custody after expiration of the 90-day removal period.  Ibid. In September
2003, Benitez received notification that he was eligible for parole, contingent
on his completion of a drug-abuse  [*376]  treatment program.  Letter from Paul
D. Clement, Acting Solicitor General, to William K. Suter, Clerk of Court, 1
(Nov. 3, 2004).  Benitez completed the program while his case was pending before
this Court, and shortly after completion was paroled for a period of one year.
Ibid. On October 15, 2004, two days after argument in this Court, Benitez was
released from custody to sponsoring family members. 3 Id., at 2.

2  [HN2] Before the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant
Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), 110 Stat 3009-546, aliens ineligible to enter the
country were denominated ""excludable"" and ordered ""deported."" 8 U.S.C. §§
1182(a), 1251(a)(1)(A) (1994 ed.); see  Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 25-26,
74 L. Ed. 2d 21, 103 S. Ct. 321 (1982).  Post-IIRIRA, such aliens are said to be
""inadmissible"" and held to be ""removable."" 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a), 1229a(e)(2)
(2000 ed.).

3  [***LEdHR4A] [4B] Despite Benitez's release on a 1-year parole, this case
continues to present a live case or controversy.  If Benitez is correct, as his
suit contends, that the Government lacks the authority to continue to detain
him, he would have to be released, and could not be taken back into custody
unless he violated the conditions of release (in which case detention would be
authorized by § 1253), or his detention became necessary to effectuate his
removal (in which case detention would once again be authorized by § 1231(a)(6)
).  His current release, however, is not only limited to one year, but subject
to the Secretary's discretionary authority to terminate.  See 8 C.F.R. §
212.12(h) (2004) (preserving discretion to revoke parole).  Thus, Benitez
""continue[s] to have a personal stake in the outcome"" of his petition.   Lewis
v. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, 477-478, 108 L. Ed. 2d 400, 110 S. Ct.

 [***LEdHR2A]  Both aliens filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28
U.S.C. § 2241 to challenge their detention beyond the 90-day removal period.  In
Martinez's case, the District Court for the District of Oregon accepted that
removal was not reasonably foreseeable, and ordered the INS to release Martinez
under conditions that the INS believed  [***744]  appropriate.  Martinez v Smith
, No. CV 02-972-PA (Oct. 30, 2002), App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 03-878, p 2a.
[**722]  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit summarily affirmed, citing
its decision in  Xi v. INS, 298 F.3d 832 (2002).  Martinez v Ashcroft, No.
03-35053 (Aug. 18, 2003), App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 03-878, at 1a.  In
Benitez's case, the District Court for the Northern District of Florida also
concluded that removal would not occur in the ""foreseeable future,"" but
nonetheless denied the petition.  Benitez v Wallis, Case No. 5:02cv19 MMP (July
11, 2002), pp 2, 4, App. in  [*377] No. 03-7434, pp 45, 48.  The Court of

[***LEdHR1A] [1D] Title 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(6) provides, in relevant part, as
follows:


      [HN3] ""An alien ordered removed who is inadmissible under section
     1182 of this title, removable under section 1227(a)(1)(C), 1227(a)(2),
     or 1227(a)(4) of this title or who has been determined by the
     [Secretary] to be a risk to the community or unlikely to comply with
     the order of removal, may be detained beyond the removal period and,
     if released, shall be subject to the terms of supervision in paragraph
     (3).""



 [HN4] By its terms, this provision applies to three categories of aliens: (1)
those ordered removed who are inadmissible under § 1182, (2) those ordered
removed who are removable under § 1227(a)(1)(C), § 1227(a)(2), or § 1227(a)(4),
and (3) those ordered removed whom the Secretary determines to be either a risk
to the community or a flight risk.  In  Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 150 L.
Ed. 2d 653, 121 S. Ct. 2491 (2001), the Court interpreted this provision to
authorize the Attorney General (now the Secretary) to detain aliens in the
second category only as long as ""reasonably necessary"" to remove them from the
country.   Id., at 689, 699, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653, 121 S. Ct. 2491.  The statute's
use of ""may,"" the Court said, ""suggests discretion,"" but ""not necessarily . . .
unlimited discretion.  In that respect the word 'may' is ambiguous.""  Id., at
697, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653, 121 S. Ct. 2491.  In light of that perceived ambiguity
and the ""serious constitutional threat"" the Court believed to be posed by
indefinite detention of aliens who had been admitted to the country,  id., at
699, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653, 121 S. Ct. 2491, the Court interpreted the statute to
permit only detention that is related to the statute's ""basic purpose [of]
effectuating an alien's removal,""   id., at 696-699, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653, 121 S.
Ct. 2491.   [HN5]  [*378]  ""[O]nce removal is no longer reasonably foreseeable,
continued detention is no longer authorized.""  Id., at 699, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653,
121 S. Ct. 2491.  The Court further held that the presumptive period during
which the detention of an alien is reasonably necessary to effectuate his
removal is six months; after that, the alien is eligible for conditional release
if he can demonstrate that there is ""no significant likelihood of removal in the
reasonably foreseeable  [***745]  future.""  Id., at 701, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653, 121
S. Ct. 2491.

The question presented by these cases, and the question that evoked
contradictory answers from the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits, is whether this
construction of § 1231(a)(6) that we applied to the second category of aliens
covered by the statute applies as well to the first--that is, to the category of
aliens ""ordered removed who [are] inadmissible under [§ ] 1182."" We think the
answer must be yes.   [HN6] The operative language of § 1231(a)(6), ""may be
detained beyond the removal period,"" applies without differentiation to all
three categories of aliens that are its subject.  To give these same words a
different meaning for each category would be to invent a statute [**723]  rather
than interpret one.  As the Court in Zadvydas recognized, the statute can be
construed ""literally"" to authorize indefinite detention,  id., at 689, 150 L.
Ed. 2d 653, 121 S. Ct. 2491, or (as the Court ultimately held) it can be read to
""suggest [less than] unlimited discretion"" to detain,  id., at 697, 150 L Ed 2d
653, 121 S Ct 2491.  It cannot, however, be interpreted to do both at the same
time.

[***LEdHR1A] [1E]  [***LEdHR3A] [3D] The dissent's belief that Zadvydas compels
this result rests primarily on that case's statement that ""[a]liens who have not
yet gained initial admission to this country would present a very different
question,""  id.,at 682, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653, 121 S. Ct. 2491.  See post, at 390,
393, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 752-753, 754 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).  This mistakes the
reservation of a question with its answer.  Neither the opinion of the Court nor
the dissent in Zadvydas so much as hints that the Court adopted the novel
interpretation of § 1231(a)(6) proposed by today's dissent.  The opinion in that
case considered  [*379]  whether § 1231(a)(6) permitted the Government to detain
removable aliens indefinitely; relying on ambiguities in the statutory text and
the canon that statutes should be interpreted to avoid constitutional doubts,
the opinion held that it did not.  Despite the dissent's repeated claims that §
1231(a)(6) could not be given a different reading for inadmissible aliens, see
Zadvydas, supra, at 710, 716-717, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653, 121 S. Ct. 2491(opinion of
KENNEDY, J.), the Court refused to decide that question--the question we answer
today.  It is indeed different from the question decided in Zadvydas, but
because the statutory text provides for no distinction between admitted and
nonadmitted aliens, we find that it results in the same answer. 4

4 The dissent is quite wrong in saying,  post, at 390, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 753,
that the Zadvydas Court's belief that § 1231(a)(6) did not apply to all aliens
is evidenced by its statement that it did not ""consider terrorism or other
special circumstances where special arguments might be made for forms of
preventive detention,""  533 U.S., at 696, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653, 121 S. Ct. 2491.
The Court's interpretation of § 1231(a)(6) did not affect the detention of alien
terrorists for the simple reason that sustained detention of alien terrorists is
a ""special arrangement"" authorized by a different statutory provision, 8 U.S.C.
§ 1537(b)(2)(C).  See  Zadvydas, supra, at 697, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653, 121 S. Ct.
2491.

 The dissent's contention that our reading of Zadvydas is ""implausible,""  post,
at 389, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 751, is hard to reconcile with the fact that it is the
identical reading espoused by the Zadvydas dissenters, who included the author
of today's dissent.  Worse still, what the Zadvydas dissent did find ""not . . .
plausible"" was  [***746]  precisely the reading adopted by today's dissent:


     ""[T]he majority's logic might be that inadmissible and removable
     aliens can be treated differently.  Yet it is not a plausible
     construction of § 1231(a)(6) to imply a time limit as to one class but
     not to another.  The text does not admit of this possibility.  As a
     result, it is difficult to see why '[a]liens who have not yet gained
     initial admission to this country would present a very different
     [*380]  question.'"" 533 U.S., at 710-711, 150 L. Ed.2d 653, 121 S. Ct.
     2491 (KENNEDY, J.).



The Zadvydas dissent later concluded that the release of ""Mariel Cubans and
other illegal, inadmissible aliens . . . would seem a necessary consequence of
the majority's construction of the statute.""   Id., at 717, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653,
121 S. Ct. 2491 (emphasis added).  Tellingly, the Zadvydas majority did not
negate either charge.

[***LEdHR1A] [1F]  [***LEdHR3A] [3E]  [***LEdHR5] [5] The Government, joined by
the dissent, argues that the statutory purpose and the constitutional concerns
that influenced our statutory construction in Zadvydas are not present for
aliens, such as Martinez and Benitez, who have not been [**724]  admitted to the
United States.  Be that as it may, it cannot justify giving the same detention
provision a different meaning when such aliens are involved.   [HN7] It is not
at all unusual to give a statute's ambiguous language a limiting construction
called for by one of the statute's applications, even though other of the
statute's applications, standing alone, would not support the same limitation.
The lowest common denominator, as it were, must govern.  See, e.g.,  Leocal v.
Ashcroft, ante, at 11-12 n. 8, 160 L. Ed. 2d 271, 125 S. Ct. 377 (2004)
(explaining that, if a statute has criminal applications, ""the rule of lenity
applies"" to the Court's interpretation of the statute even in immigration cases
""[b]ecause we must interpret the statute consistently, whether we encounter its
application in a criminal or noncriminal context"");  United States v.
Thompson/Center Arms Co., 504 U.S. 505, 517-518, and n 10,119 L. Ed. 2d 308, 112
S. Ct. 2102 (1992) (plurality opinion) (employing the rule of lenity to
interpret ""a tax statute . . . in a civil setting"" because the statute ""has
criminal applications"");  id., 519, 119 L. Ed. 2d 308, 112 S. Ct. 2102 (Scalia,
J., concurring in judgment) (also invoking the rule of lenity).  In other words,
when deciding which of two plausible statutory constructions to adopt, a court
must consider the necessary consequences of its choice.  If one of them would
raise a multitude of constitutional  [*381]  problems, the other should
prevail--whether or not those constitutional problems pertain to the particular
litigant before the Court. 5

5 Contrary to the dissent's contentions,  post, at 394, 160 L Ed 2d, at 755, our
decision in  Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 139 L. Ed. 2d 352, 118 S.
Ct. 469 (1997), is perfectly consistent with this principle of construction.  In
Salinas, the Court rejected the petitioner's invocation of the avoidance canon
because the text of the statute was ""unambiguous on the point under
consideration.""  Id., at 60, 139 L. Ed. 2d 352, 118 S. Ct. 469.  For this
reason, the Court squarely addressed and rejected any argument that the statute
was unconstitutional as applied to the petitioner.   Id., at 61, 139 L. Ed. 2d
352, 118 S. Ct. 469 (holding that, under the construction adopted by the Court,
""the statute is constitutional as applied in this case"").

  [***LEdHR3A] [3F]  [***LEdHR6] [6]  [***LEdHR7] [7] The dissent takes issue
with this maxim of statutory construction on the ground that it allows litigants
to ""attack statutes as  [***747]  constitutionally invalid based on
constitutional doubts concerning other litigants or factual circumstances"" and
thereby to effect an ""end run around black-letter constitutional doctrine
governing facial and as-applied constitutional challenges.""  Post, at 396, 160 L
Ed 2d, at 756.  This accusation misconceives--and fundamentally so--the role
played by the canon of constitutional avoidance in statutory interpretation.
[HN8] The canon is not a method of adjudicating constitutional questions by
other means.  See, e.g.,  NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U.S. 490, 502,
59 L. Ed. 2d 533, 99 S. Ct. 1313 (1979) (refusing to engage in extended analysis
in the process of applying the avoidance canon ""as we would were we considering
the constitutional issue""); see also Vermeule, Saving Constructions,  85 Geo. L.
J. 1945, 1960-1961 (1997) (providing examples of cases where the Court construed
a statute narrowly to avoid a constitutional question ultimately resolved in
favor of the broader reading).  Indeed, one of the canon's chief justifications
is that it allows courts to avoid the decision of constitutional questions.  It
is a tool for choosing between competing plausible interpretations of a
statutory text, resting on the reasonable presumption that Congress did not
intend the alternative which raises serious constitutional doubts.  [*382]  See
Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 191, 114 L. Ed. 2d 233, 111 S. Ct. 1759 (1991);
Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades
Council, 485 U.S. 568, 575, 99 L. Ed. 2d [**725]  645, 108 S. Ct. 1392 (1988).
The canon is thus a means of giving effect to congressional intent, not of
subverting it.  And when a litigant invokes the canon of avoidance, he is not
attempting to vindicate the constitutional rights of others, as the dissent
believes; he seeks to vindicate his own statutory rights.  We find little to
recommend the novel interpretive approach advocated by the dissent, which would
render every statute a chameleon, its meaning subject to change depending on the
presence or absence of constitutional concerns in each individual case.  Cf.
Harris v. United States, 536 U.S. 545, 556, 153 L. Ed. 2d 524, 122 S. Ct. 2406
(2002) (rejecting ""a dynamic view of statutory interpretation, under which the
text might mean one thing when enacted yet another if the prevailing view of the
Constitution later changed"").

[***LEdHR3A] [3G] In support of its contention that we can give § 1231(a)(6) a
different meaning when it is applied to nonadmitted aliens, the Government
relies most prominently upon our decision in  Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 76
L. Ed. 598, 52 S. Ct. 285 (1932).  Brief for Petitioners in No. 03-878, p 29;
Brief for Respondent in No. 03-7434, p 29.  That case involved a statutory
provision that gave the Deputy Commissioner of the United States Employees'
Compensation Commission ""'full power and authority to hear and determine all
questions in respect of'"" claims under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers'
Compensation Act.   285 U.S., at 62, 76 L. Ed. 598, 52 S. Ct. 285.  The question
presented was whether this provision precluded review of the Deputy
Commissioner's determination that the claimant was an employee,  and hence
covered by the Act.  The Court held that, although the statute could be read to
bar judicial review altogether, it was also susceptible of a narrower reading
that permitted judicial review of the fact of  [***748]  employment, which was
an ""essential condition precedent to the right to make the claim."" Ibid. The
Court adopted the latter construction in order to avoid serious constitutional
questions that it believed would  [*383]  be raised by total preclusion of
judicial review. Ibid. This holding does not produce a statute that bears two
different meanings, depending on the presence or absence of a constitutional
question.  Always, and as applied to all claimants, it permits judicial review
of the employment finding.  What corresponds to Crowell v. Benson's holding that
the fact of employment is judicially reviewable is Zadvydas's holding that
detention cannot be continued once removal is no longer reasonably
foreseeable--and like the one, the other applies in all cases.

[***LEdHR3A] [3H] The dissent, on the other hand, relies on our recent cases
interpreting 28 U.S.C. § 1367(d) .   Raygor v. Regents of Univ. of Minn., 534
U.S. 533, 152 L. Ed. 2d 27, 122 S. Ct. 999 (2002), held that  [HN9] this
provision does not include, in its tolling of limitations periods, claims
against States that have not waived their immunity from suit in federal court,
because the statutory language fails to make ""'""unmistakably clear,""'"" as it
must in provisions subjecting States to suit, that such States were covered.
Id., at 543-546, 152 L. Ed. 2d 27, 122 S. Ct. 999.  A subsequent decision,
Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U.S. 456, 155 L. Ed. 2d 631, 123 S. Ct. 1667
(2003), held that the tolling provision does apply to claims against political
subdivisions of States, since the requirement of the unmistakably clear
statement did not apply to those entities.   Id., at 466, 155 L. Ed. 2d 631, 123
S. Ct. 1667.  This progression of decisions does not remotely establish that §
1367(d) has two different meanings, equivalent to the
unlimited-detention/limited-detention meanings of § 1231(a)(6) urged upon us
here.  They hold that the single and unchanging disposition of § 1367(d) (the
tolling of limitations periods)  does not apply to claims against [**726]
States that have not consented to be sued in federal court. 6

6  [***LEdHR3A] [3I] The dissent concedes this is so but argues,  post, at
393-394, 160 L Ed 2d, at 755, that, because the Court reached this conclusion
""only after analyzing whether the constitutional doubts at issue in Raygor
applied to the county defendant"" in Jinks,  post, at 393, 160 L Ed 2d, at 755,
we must engage in the same quasi-constitutional analysis here before applying
the construction adopted in Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001), to the
aliens in these cases.  This overlooks a critical distinction between the
question before the Court in Jinks and the one before us today.  In Jinks, the
county could not claim the aid of Raygor itself because Raygor held only that §
1367(d) did not include suits against nonconsenting States; instead, the county
argued by analogy to Raygor that, absent a clear statement of congressional
intent, § 1367(d) should be construed not to include suits against political
subdivisions of States.  And thus the Court in Jinks considered not whether
Raygor's interpretation of § 1367(d) was directly controlling but whether the
constitutional concerns that justified the requirement of a clear statement in
Raygor applied as well in the case of counties.  In the present cases, by
contrast, the aliens ask simply that the interpretation of § 1231(a)(6)
announced in Zadvydas be applied to them.  This question does not compel us to
compare analogous constitutional doubts; it simply requires that we determine
whether the statute construed by Zadvydas permits any distinction to be drawn
between aliens who have been admitted and aliens who have not.

  [***LEdHR3A] [3J]  [***LEdHR8] [8]  [*384]  We also reject the Government's
argument that, under Zadvydas, § 1231(a)(6) ""authorizes detention until it
approaches constitutional limits."" Brief for Petitioners in No. 03-878, at
27-28; Brief for Respondent in No. 03-7434, at 27-28.   [***749]  The Government
provides no citation to support that description of the case--and none exists.
Zadvydas did not hold that the statute authorizes detention until it approaches
constitutional limits; it held that, since interpreting the statute to authorize
indefinite detention (one plausible reading) would approach constitutional
limits, the statute should be read (in line with the other plausible reading) to
authorize detention only for a period consistent with the purpose of
effectuating removal.  533 U.S., at 697-699, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653, 121 S. Ct. 2491.
If we were, as the Government seems to believe, free to ""interpret"" statutes as
becoming inoperative when they ""approach constitutional limits,"" we would be
able to spare ourselves the necessity of ever finding a statute unconstitutional
as applied.  And the doctrine that statutes should be construed to contain
substantive dispositions that do not raise constitutional difficulty would be a
thing of the past; no need for such caution, since--whatever the substantive
dispositions are--they become inoperative when constitutional limits are
""approached.""  [*385]  That is not the legal world we live in.   [HN10] The
canon of constitutional avoidance comes into play only when, after the
application of ordinary textual analysis, the statute is found to be susceptible
of more than one construction; and the canon functions as a means of choosing
between them. See, e.g.,  Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224,
237-238, 140 L. Ed. 2d 350, 118 S. Ct. 1219 (1998);  United States ex rel.
Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U.S. 366, 408, 53 L. Ed. 836, 29
S. Ct. 527 (1909).  In Zadvydas, it was the statute's text read in light of its
purpose, not some implicit statutory command to avoid approaching constitutional
limits, which produced the rule that the Secretary may detain aliens only for
the period reasonably necessary to bring about their removal. See   533 U.S., at
697-699, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653, 121 S. Ct. 2491.

[***LEdHR1A] [1G] In passing in its briefs, but more intensively at oral
argument, the Government sought to justify its continued detention of these
aliens on the authority of § 1182(d)(5)(A). 7  [HN11] Even assuming that an
[**727]  alien who is subject to a final order of removal is an ""alien applying
for admission"" and therefore eligible for parole under this provision, we find
nothing in this text that affirmatively authorizes detention, much less
indefinite detention. To the contrary, it provides that, when parole is revoked,
""the alien shall . . . be returned to the custody from which he was paroled and
thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that
of any other applicant for admission."" Ibid. (emphasis  [*386]  added).  The
manner in which the case of any other applicant would be ""dealt with"" beyond the
90-day removal period is prescribed by § 1231(a)(6), which we interpreted in
[***750]  Zadvydas and have interpreted above.

 [*502]  [**1144]   Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A]  The California Department of Corrections (CDC) has an unwritten
policy of racially segregating prisoners in double cells in reception centers
for up to 60 days each time they enter a new correctional facility.  We consider
whether strict scrutiny is the proper standard of review for an equal protection
challenge to that policy.

I

A

CDC institutions house all new male inmates and all male inmates transferred
from other state facilities in reception centers for up to 60 days upon their
arrival.  During that time, prison officials evaluate the inmates to determine
their ultimate placement.  Double-cell assignments in the reception centers are
based on a number of factors, predominantly race.  In fact, the CDC has admitted
that the chances of an inmate being assigned a cellmate of another race are
""'[p]retty close'"" to zero percent.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a.  The CDC further
subdivides prisoners within each racial group.  Thus, Japanese-Americans are
housed separately from Chinese-Americans, and northern California Hispanics are
separated from southern California Hispanics.

The CDC's asserted rationale for this practice is that it is necessary to
prevent violence caused by racial gangs.  Brief for Respondents 1-6.  It cites
numerous incidents of racial violence in CDC facilities and identifies five
major prison gangs in [**1145]  the State: Mexican Mafia, Nuestra Familia, Black
Guerilla Family, Aryan Brotherhood, and Nazi Low Riders.  Id., at 2.  The CDC
also notes that prison-gang culture is violent and murderous.  Id., at 3.  An
associate warden testified  [*503]  that if race were not considered in making
initial housing assignments, she is certain there would be racial conflict in
the cells and in the yard.  App. 215a.  Other prison officials also expressed
their belief that violence and conflict would result if prisoners were not
segregated.  See, e.g., id., at 305a-306a.  The CDC claims that it must
therefore segregate all inmates while it determines whether they pose a
[***957]  danger to others.  See Brief for Respondents 29.

With the exception of the double cells in reception areas, the rest of the state
prison facilities--dining areas, yards, and cells--are fully integrated. After
the initial 60-day period, prisoners are allowed to choose their own cellmates.
The CDC usually grants inmate requests to be housed together, unless there are
security reasons for denying them.

B

Garrison Johnson is an African-American inmate in the custody of the CDC.  He
has been incarcerated since 1987 and, during that time, has been housed at a
number of California prison facilities.  Fourth Amended Complaint 3, Record,
Doc. No. 78.  Upon his arrival at Folsom prison in 1987, and each time he was
transferred to a new facility thereafter, Johnson was double-celled with another
African-American inmate. See ibid.

Johnson filed a complaint pro se in the United States District Court for the
Central District of California on February 24, 1995, alleging that the CDC's
reception-center housing policy violated his right to equal protection under the
Fourteenth Amendment by assigning him cellmates on the basis of his race.  He
alleged that, from 1987 to 1991, former CDC Director James Rowland instituted
and enforced an unconstitutional policy of housing inmates according to race.
Second Amended Complaint 2-4, Record, Doc. No. 21.  Johnson made the same
allegations against former Director James Gomez for the period from 1991 until
the filing of his complaint.  Ibid. The District Court dismissed his complaint
[*504]  for failure to state a claim.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit reversed and remanded, holding that Johnson had stated a claim for
racial discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment.   Johnson v. California, 207 F.3d 650, 655 (2000).

On remand, Johnson was appointed counsel and granted leave to amend his
complaint.  On July 5, 2000, he filed his Fourth Amended Complaint.  Record,
Doc. No. 81.  Johnson claimed that the CDC's policy of racially segregating all
inmates in reception-center cells violated his rights under the Equal Protection
Clause.  Johnson sought damages, alleging that former CDC Directors Rowland and
Gomez, in their individual capacities, violated his constitutional rights by
formulating and implementing the CDC's housing policy.  He also sought
injunctive relief against former CDC Director Stephen Cambra.

Johnson has consistently challenged, and the CDC has consistently defended, the
policy as a whole--as it relates to both new inmates and inmates transferred
from other facilities.  Johnson was first segregated in 1987 as a new inmate
when he entered the CDC facility at Folsom.  Since 1987, he has been segregated
each time he has been transferred to a new facility.  Thus, he has been subject
to the CDC's policy both as a new inmate and as an inmate transferred from one
facility to another.

After discovery, the parties moved for summary judgment.  The District Court
[**1146]  granted summary judgment to the defendants on grounds that they were
entitled to qualified immunity because their conduct was not clearly
unconstitutional.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.
[***958]   21 F.3d 791 (2003).  It held that the constitutionality of the CDC's
policy should be reviewed under the deferential standard we articulated in
Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 96 L. Ed. 2d 64, 107 S. Ct. 2254 (1987) --not
strict scrutiny.  321 F.3d, at 798-799.  Applying Turner, it held that Johnson
had the burden of refuting the ""common-sense connection"" between the policy and
[*505]  prison violence.  321 F.3d, at 802.  Though it believed this was a
""close case,""  id., at 798, the Court of Appeals concluded that the policy
survived Turner's deferential standard,  321 F.3d, at 807.

The Court of Appeals denied Johnson's petition for rehearing en banc.  Judge
Ferguson, joined by three others, dissented on grounds that ""[t]he panel's
decision ignore[d] the Supreme Court's repeated and unequivocal command that all
racial classifications imposed by the government must be analyzed by a reviewing
court under strict scrutiny, and fail[ed] to recognize that [the] Turner
analysis is inapplicable in cases, such as this one, in which the right asserted
is not inconsistent with legitimate penological objectives.""  336 F.3d 1117
(2003) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  We granted certiorari
to decide which standard of review applies.   540 U.S. 1217, 158 L. Ed. 2d 151,
124 S. Ct. 1505 (2004).

[***LEdHR2A]  We have held that  [HN1] ""all racial classifications [imposed by
government] . . . must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.""
Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 227, 132 L. Ed. 2d 158, 115 S.
Ct. 2097 (1995) (emphasis added).  Under strict scrutiny, the government has the
burden of proving that racial classifications ""are narrowly tailored measures
that further compelling governmental interests."" Ibid. We have insisted on
strict scrutiny in every context, even for so-called ""benign"" racial
classifications, such as race-conscious university admissions policies, see
Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 326, 156 L. Ed. 2d 304, 123 S. Ct. 2325
(2003), race-based preferences in government contracts, see  Adarand, supra, at
226, 132 L. Ed. 2d 158, 115 S. Ct. 2097, and race-based districting intended to
improve minority representation, see  Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 650, 125 L.
Ed. 2d 511, 113 S. Ct. 2816 (1993).

[***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR3A]  The reasons for strict scrutiny are familiar.
Racial classifications raise special fears that they are motivated by an
invidious purpose.  Thus, we have admonished time and  [*506]  again that,
""[a]bsent searching judicial inquiry into the justification for such race-based
measures, there is simply no way of determining . . . what classifications are
in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial
politics.""  Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493, 102 L. Ed. 2d 854,
109 S. Ct. 706 (1989) (plurality opinion).  We therefore apply strict scrutiny
to all racial classifications to ""'smoke out' illegitimate uses of race by
assuring that [government] is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant use of
a highly suspect tool."" Ibid. 1

[***LEdHR3A]  Justice Thomas takes a hands-off approach to racial
classifications in prisons, suggesting that a ""compelling showing [is] needed to
overcome the deference we owe to prison administrators.""  Post, at 543, 160 L.
Ed. 2d, at 984 (dissenting opinion).  But such deference is fundamentally at
odds with our equal protection jurisprudence.  We put the burden on state actors
to demonstrate that their race-based policies are justified.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  [***LEdHR1A]  The CDC claims that its policy  [***959]  should be exempt from
our categorical rule because [**1147]  it is ""neutral""--that is, it ""neither
benefits nor burdens one group or individual more than any other group or
individual."" Brief for Respondents 16.  In other words, strict scrutiny should
not apply because all prisoners are ""equally"" segregated.  The CDC's argument
ignores our repeated command that  [HN2] ""racial classifications receive close
scrutiny even when they may be said to burden or benefit the races equally.""
Shaw, supra, at 651, 125 L. Ed. 2d 511, 113 S. Ct. 2816.  Indeed, we rejected
the notion that separate can ever be equal--or ""neutral""--50 years ago in  Brown
v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 98 L. Ed. 873, 74 S. Ct. 686 (1954), and we
refuse to resurrect it today.  See also  Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 410, 113
L. Ed. 2d 411, 111 S. Ct. 1364 (1991) (rejecting the argument that race-based
peremptory challenges were permissible because they applied equally to white and
black jurors and holding that ""[i]t is axiomatic that racial classifications do
not become legitimate on the assumption that all persons suffer them in equal
degree"").

We have previously applied a heightened standard of review in evaluating racial
segregation in prisons. In  Lee v.  [*507]  Washington, 390 U.S. 333, 19 L. Ed.
2d 1212, 88 S. Ct. 994 (1968) (per curiam), we upheld a three-judge court's
decision striking down Alabama's policy of segregation in its prisons.  Id., at
333-334, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1212, 88 S. Ct. 994.  Alabama had argued that
desegregation would undermine prison security and discipline,  id., at 334, 19
L. Ed. 2d 1212, 88 S. Ct. 994, but we rejected that contention.  Three Justices
concurred ""to make explicit something that is left to be gathered only by
implication from the Court's opinion""--""that prison authorities have the right,
acting in good faith and in particularized circumstances, to take into account
racial tensions in maintaining security, discipline, and good order in prisons
and jails."" Ibid. (emphasis added).  The concurring Justices emphasized that
they were ""unwilling to assume that state or local prison authorities might
mistakenly regard such an explicit pronouncement as evincing any dilution of
this Court's firm commitment to the Fourteenth Amendment's prohibition of racial
discrimination."" Ibid.

The need for strict scrutiny is no less important here, where prison officials
cite racial violence as the reason for their policy.  As we have recognized in
the past,  [HN3] racial classifications ""threaten to stigmatize individuals by
reason of their membership in a racial group and to incite racial hostility.""
Shaw, supra, at 643, 125 L. Ed. 2d 511, 113 S. Ct. 2816 (citing  J. A. Croson
Co., supra, at 493, 102 L. Ed. 2d 854, 109 S. Ct. 706 (plurality opinion);
emphasis added).  Indeed, by insisting that inmates be housed only with other
inmates of the same race, it is possible that prison officials will breed
further hostility among prisoners and reinforce racial and ethnic divisions.  By
perpetuating the notion that race matters most, racial segregation of inmates
""may exacerbate the very patterns of [violence that it is] said to counteract.""
Shaw, supra, at 648, 125 L. Ed. 2d 511, 113 S. Ct. 2816; see also Trulson &
Marquart, The Caged Melting Pot: Toward an Understanding  [***960]  of the
Consequences of Desegregation in Prisons,  36 Law & Soc. Rev. 743, 774 (2002)
(in a study of prison desegregation, finding that ""over [10 years] the rate of
violence between inmates segregated by race in double cells surpassed the rate
among those  [*508]  racially integrated"").  See also Brief for Former State
Corrections Officials as Amici Curiae 19 (opinion of former corrections
officials from six States that ""racial integration of cells tends to diffuse
racial tensions and thus diminish interracial violence"" and that ""a blanket
[**1148]  policy of racial segregation of inmates is contrary to sound prison
management"").

The CDC's policy is unwritten.  Although California claimed at oral argument
that two other States follow a similar policy, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 30-31, this
assertion was unsubstantiated, and we are unable to confirm or deny its
accuracy. 2 Virtually all other States and the Federal Government manage their
prison systems without reliance on racial segregation. See Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 24.  Federal regulations governing the Federal Bureau of
Prisons (BOP) expressly prohibit racial segregation. 28 CFR § 551.90 (2004)
(""[BOP] staff shall not discriminate  [*509]  against inmates on the basis of
race, religion, national origin, sex, disability, or political belief.  This
includes the making of administrative decisions and providing access to work,
housing and programs"").  The United States contends that racial integration
actually ""leads to less violence in BOP's institutions and better prepares
inmates for re-entry into society."" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25.
Indeed, the United States argues, based on its experience with the BOP, that it
is possible to address ""concerns of prison security through individualized
consideration without the use of racial segregation, unless warranted as a
necessary and temporary response to a race riot or other serious threat of
race-related violence."" Id., at 24.  As to transferees, in particular, whom the
CDC has already evaluated at least once, it is not clear why more individualized
determinations are not possible.

2 Though, as Justice Thomas points out, see  post, at 544-545, and n 12, 160 L.
Ed. 2d, at 983-984, inmates in reception centers in Oklahoma and Texas ""'are not
generally assigned randomly to racially integrated cells,'"" it is also the case
that ""these inmates are not precluded from integrated cell assignments,""
Oklahoma Dept. of Corrections, Policies and Procedures, Operations Memorandum
No. OP-030102, Inmate Housing (Sept. 16, 2004), available at
http://www.doc.state.ok.us/docs/policies.htm (as visited Jan. 21, 2005, and
available in Clerk of Court's case file); Texas Dept. of Criminal Justice,
Security Memorandum No. SM-01.28, Assignment to General Population Two-Person
Cells (June 15, 2002).  See also Brief for Former State Corrections Officials as
Amici Curiae 20, n 10 (""To the extent that race is considered in the assignment
calculus in Oklahoma, it appears to be one factor among many, and as a result,
individualized consideration is given to all inmates"").  We therefore have no
way of knowing whether, in practice, inmates in Oklahoma and Texas, like those
in California, have close to no chance, App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a, of being
celled with a person of a different race.  See also Brief for Former State
Corrections Officials as Amici Curiae 19-20 (""[W]e are aware of no state other
than California that assumes that every incoming prisoner is incapable of
getting along with a cell mate of a different race.  And we are aware of no
state other than California that has acted on such an assumption by adopting an
inflexible and absolute policy of racial segregation of double cells in
reception centers"").

 Because the CDC's policy is an express racial classification, it is
""immediately suspect.""  Shaw, 509 U.S., at 642, 125 L. Ed. 2d 511, 113 S. Ct.
2816; see also  Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 457, 485,
[***961]  73 L. Ed. 2d 896, 102 S. Ct. 3187 (1982).  We therefore hold that the
Court of Appeals erred when it failed to apply strict scrutiny to the CDC's
policy and to require the CDC to demonstrate that its policy is narrowly
tailored to serve a compelling state interest.

B

The CDC invites us to make an exception to the rule that strict scrutiny applies
to all racial classifications, and instead to apply the deferential standard of
review articulated in  Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 96 L. Ed. 2d 64, 107 S.
Ct. 2254 (1987), because its segregation policy applies only [**1149]  in the
prison context.  We decline the invitation.  In Turner, we considered a claim by
Missouri prisoners that regulations restricting inmate marriages and
inmate-to-inmate correspondence were unconstitutional.   Id., at 81, 96 L. Ed.
2d 64, 107 S. Ct. 2254.  We rejected the prisoners' argument that the
regulations should be subject to strict scrutiny, asking instead whether the
regulation that burdened the prisoners'  [*510]  fundamental rights was
""reasonably related"" to ""legitimate penological interests.""  Id., at 89, 96 L.
Ed. 2d 64, 107 S. Ct. 2254.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR4A]  We have never applied Turner to racial
classifications. Turner itself did not involve any racial classification, and it
cast no doubt on Lee. We think this unsurprising, as we have applied Turner's
reasonable-relationship test only to rights that are ""inconsistent with proper
incarceration.""  Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U.S. 126, 131, 156 L. Ed. 2d 162, 123
S. Ct. 2162 (2003); see also  Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 822, 41 L. Ed. 2d
495, 94 S. Ct. 2800 (1974) (""[A] prison inmate retains those First Amendment
rights that are not inconsistent with his status as a prisoner or with the
legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system"").  This is because
certain privileges and rights must necessarily be limited in the prison context.
See  O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 348, 96 L. Ed. 2d 282, 107 S.
Ct. 2400 (1987) (""'[L]awful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal
or limitation of many privileges and rights, a retraction justified by the
considerations underlying our penal system'"" (quoting  Price v. Johnston, 334
U.S. 266, 285, 92 L. Ed. 1356, 68 S. Ct. 1049 (1948))).  Thus, for example, we
have relied on Turner in addressing  First Amendment challenges to prison
regulations, including restrictions on freedom of association,  Overton, supra;
limits on inmate correspondence,  Shaw v. Murphy, 532 U.S. 223, 149 L. Ed. 2d
420, 121 S. Ct. 1475 (2001); restrictions on inmates' access to courts,  Lewis
v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 135 L. Ed. 2d 606, 116 S. Ct. 2174 (1996); restrictions
on receipt of subscription publications,  Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401,
104 L. Ed. 2d 459, 109 S. Ct. 1874 (1989); and work rules limiting prisoners'
attendance at religious services,  Shabazz, supra. We have also applied Turner
to some due process claims, such as involuntary medication of mentally ill
prisoners,  Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 108 L. Ed. 2d 178, 110 S. Ct.
1028 (1990); and restrictions on the right to marry,  Turner, supra.

[***LEdHR4A]   [***LEdHR5] [5]  [HN4] The right not to be discriminated against
based on one's race is not susceptible to the logic of Turner. It is not a right
that need necessarily be compromised for the sake of proper prison
administration.  On the  [***962]  contrary, compliance with the Fourteenth
Amendment's ban on racial discrimination  [*511]  is not only consistent with
proper prison administration, but also bolsters the legitimacy of the entire
criminal justice system.  Race discrimination is ""especially pernicious in the
administration of justice.""  Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U.S. 545, 555, 61 L. Ed. 2d
739, 99 S. Ct. 2993 (1979).  And public respect for our system of justice is
undermined when the system discriminates based on race.  Cf.  Batson v. Kentucky
, 476 U.S. 79, 99, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712 (1986) (""[P]ublic respect
for our criminal justice system and the rule of law will be strengthened if we
ensure that no citizen is disqualified from jury service because of his race"").
When government officials are permitted to use race as a proxy for gang
membership and violence without demonstrating a compelling government interest
and proving that their means are narrowly tailored, society as a whole suffers.
For similar reasons, we have not used Turner to evaluate Eighth Amendment claims
of cruel and unusual punishment in prison. We judge violations [**1150]  of that
Amendment under the ""deliberate indifference"" standard, rather than Turner's
""reasonably related"" standard.  See  Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 738, 153 L.
Ed. 2d 666, 122 S. Ct. 2508 (2002) (asking whether prison officials displayed
""'deliberate indifference' to the inmates' health or safety"" where an inmate
claimed that they violated his rights under the Eighth Amendment (quoting
Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 8, 117 L. Ed. 2d 156, 112 S. Ct. 995 (1992))).
This is because the integrity of the criminal justice system depends on full
compliance with the Eighth Amendment.  See  Spain v. Procunier, 600 F.2d 189,
193-194 (CA9 1979) (Kennedy, J.) (""[T]he full protections of the eighth
amendment most certainly remain in force [in prison].  The whole point of the
amendment is to protect persons convicted of crimes.  . . .  Mechanical
deference to the findings of state prison officials in the context of the eighth
amendment would reduce that provision to a nullity in precisely the context
where it is most necessary"").

[***LEdHR1A]  In the prison context, when the government's power is at its apex,
we think that searching judicial review of racial classifications is necessary
to guard against invidious discrimination.   [*512]  Granting the CDC an
exemption from the rule that strict scrutiny applies to all racial
classifications would undermine our ""unceasing efforts to eradicate racial
prejudice from our criminal justice system.""  McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279,
309, 95 L. Ed. 2d 262, 107 S. Ct. 1756 (1987) (internal quotation marks
omitted).

The CDC argues that ""[d]eference to the particular expertise of prison officials
in the difficult task of managing daily prison operations"" requires a more
relaxed standard of review for its segregation policy.  Brief for Respondents
18.  But we have refused to defer to state officials' judgments on race in other
areas where those officials traditionally exercise substantial discretion.  For
example, we have held that, despite the broad discretion given to prosecutors
when they use their peremptory challenges, using those challenges to strike
jurors on the basis of their race is impermissible.  See  Batson, supra, at
89-96, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712.  Similarly, in  [***963]  the
redistricting context, despite the traditional deference given to States when
they design their electoral districts, we have subjected redistricting plans to
strict scrutiny when States draw district lines based predominantly on race.
Compare generally  Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U.S. 267, 158 L. Ed. 2d 546, 124 S.
Ct. 1769 (2004) (partisan gerrymandering), with  Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 125
L. Ed. 2d 511, 113 S. Ct. 2816 (1993) (racial gerrymandering).

We did not relax the standard of review for racial classifications in prison in
Lee, and we refuse to do so today.  Rather, we explicitly reaffirm what we
implicitly held in Lee:  [HN5] The ""necessities of prison security and
discipline,""  390 U.S., at 334, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1212, 88 S. Ct. 994, are a
compelling government interest justifying only those uses of race that are
narrowly tailored to address those necessities.  See  Grutter, 539 U.S., at 353,
156 L. Ed. 2d 304, 123 S. Ct. 2325 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part) (citing Lee for the principle that ""protecting prisoners
from violence might justify narrowly tailored racial discrimination"");  J. A.
Croson Co., 488 U.S., at 521, 102 L. Ed. 2d 854, 109 S. Ct. 706 (Scalia, J.,
concurring in judgment) (citing Lee for the proposition that ""only a social
emergency rising to the level of imminent danger to life and limb--for  [*513]
example, a prison race riot, requiring temporary segregation of inmates--can
justify an exception to the principle embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment that
'[o]ur Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes
among citizens'"" (quoting  [**1151]   Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 559, 41
L. Ed. 256, 16 S. Ct. 1138 (1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting))); see also  Pell,
417 U.S., at 823, 41 L. Ed. 2d 495, 94 S. Ct. 2800 (""[C]entral to all other
corrections goals is the institutional consideration of internal security within
the corrections facilities themselves"").

Justice Thomas would subject race-based policies in prisons to Turner's
deferential standard of review because, in his view, judgments about whether
race-based policies are necessary ""are better left in the first instance to the
officials who run our Nation's prisons.""  Post, at 542, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 982.
But Turner is too lenient a standard to ferret out invidious uses of race.
Turner requires only that the policy be ""reasonably related"" to ""legitimate
penological interests.""  482 U.S., at 89, 96 L. Ed. 2d 64, 107 S. Ct. 2254.
Turner would allow prison officials to use race-based policies even when there
are race-neutral means to accomplish the same goal, and even when the race-based
policy does not in practice advance that goal.  See, e.g.,  321 F.3d, at 803
(case below) (reasoning that, under Turner, the Court of Appeals did ""not have
to agree that the policy actually advances the CDC's legitimate interest, but
only [that] 'defendants might reasonably have thought that the policy would
advance its interests'"").  See also  Turner, supra, at 90, 96 L. Ed. 2d 64, 107
S. Ct. 2254 (warning that Turner is not a ""least restrictive alternative test""
(internal quotation marks omitted)).

For example, in Justice Thomas' world, prison officials could segregate visiting
areas on the ground that racial mixing would cause unrest in the racially
charged prison atmosphere.  Under Turner, ""[t]he prisoner would have to prove
that there would not be a riot[.]  [But] [i]t is certainly 'plausible' that such
a riot could ensue: our society, as well as our  [***964]  prisons, contains
enough racists that almost any interracial interaction could potentially lead to
conflict.""  336 F.3d, at  [*514]  1120 (case below) (Ferguson, J., dissenting
from denial of rehearing en banc).  Indeed, under Justice Thomas' view, there is
no obvious limit to permissible segregation in prisons. It is not readily
apparent why, if segregation in reception centers is justified, segregation in
the dining halls, yards, and general housing areas is not also permissible.  Any
of these areas could be the potential site of racial violence. If Justice
Thomas' approach were to carry the day, even the blanket segregation policy
struck down in Lee might stand a chance of survival if prison officials simply

On October 1, 1998, the City adopted a pay plan granting raises to all City
employees.  The stated purpose of the plan was to ""attract and retain qualified
people, provide incentive for performance, maintain competitiveness with other
public sector agencies and ensure equitable compensation to all employees
regardless of age, sex, race and/or disability."" 1 On May 1, 1999, a revision of
the plan, which was motivated, at least in part, by the City's desire to bring
the starting salaries of police officers up to the regional average, granted
raises to all police officers and police dispatchers.  Those who had less than
five years of tenure received proportionately greater raises when compared to
their former pay than those with more seniority. Although some officers over the
age of 40 had less than five years of service, most of the older officers had
more.

Petitioners are a group of older officers who filed suit under the ADEA claiming
both that the City deliberately discriminated against them because of their age
(the ""disparate-treatment"" claim) and that they were ""adversely affected"" by the
plan because of their age (the ""disparate-impact"" claim).  The District Court
granted summary judgment to the City on both [**1540]  claims.  The Court of
Appeals held that the ruling on the former claim was premature because
petitioners were entitled to further discovery on the issue of intent, but it
affirmed the dismissal of the disparate-impact claim.   351 F.3d 183 (CA5 2003).
Over one judge's dissent, the majority concluded that disparate-impact claims
are categorically unavailable under the ADEA.  Both the majority and the dissent
assumed that the facts alleged by petitioners would entitle them to relief under
the reasoning of Griggs.

[*232]   [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]  We granted the officers' petition for
certiorari, 541 U.S. 958, 158 L. Ed. 2d 398, 124 S. Ct. 1724 (2004), and now
hold that  [HN1] the ADEA does authorize recovery in ""disparate-impact"" cases
comparable to Griggs. Because, however, we conclude that petitioners have not
set forth a valid disparate-impact claim, we affirm.

During the deliberations that preceded the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, Congress considered and rejected proposed amendments that would have
included older workers among the classes protected from employment
discrimination. 2 General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U.S. 581,
587, 157 L. Ed. 2d 1094, 124 S. Ct. 1236 (2004).  Congress did, however, request
the Secretary of Labor to ""make a full and complete study of the factors which
might tend to result in discrimination in employment because of age and of the
consequences of such discrimination on the economy and individuals affected.""
[***417]  § 715, 78 Stat 265.  The Secretary's report, submitted in response to
Congress' request, noted that there was little discrimination arising from
dislike or intolerance of older people, but that ""arbitrary"" discrimination did
result from certain age limits.  Report of the Secretary of Labor, The Older
American Worker: Age Discrimination in Employment 5 (June 1965), reprinted in U.
S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Legislative History of the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act (1981), Doc. No. 5 (hereinafter Wirtz Report).
Moreover, the report observed that discriminatory effects resulted from
""[i]nstitutional arrangements that indirectly restrict the employment of older
workers."" Id., at 15.

 [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]  In response to that report Congress directed the

of 1966, Pub. L. 89-601, § 606, 80 Stat. 845, and  [*233]  then acted favorably
on his proposal.  As enacted in 1967, § 4(a)(2) of the ADEA, now codified as
[HN2] 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(2) [29 USCS § 623(a)(2)], provided that it shall be
unlawful for an employer ""to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any
way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment
opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because
of such individual's age . . . ."" 81 Stat 603.  Except for substitution of the
word ""age"" for the words ""race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,"" the
language of that provision in the ADEA is identical to that found in § 703(a)(2)
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII).  Other provisions of the ADEA also
parallel the earlier statute. 3 Unlike Title VII, however, § 4(f)(1) of the
ADEA81 Stat 603,  [**1541] contains language that significantly narrows its
coverage by permitting any ""otherwise prohibited"" action ""where the
differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age"" (hereinafter RFOA
provision).

In determining whether the ADEA authorizes disparate-impact claims, we begin
with the premise that  [HN4] when Congress uses the same language in two
statutes having similar purposes, particularly when one is enacted shortly after
the other, it is appropriate to presume that Congress intended that text to have
the same meaning in both statutes.   Northcross v. Board of Ed. of Memphis City
Schools, 412 U.S. 427, 428, 37 L. Ed. 2d 48, 93 S. Ct. 2201 (1973) (per curiam).
We have consistently applied  [*234]  that presumption to language in the ADEA
that was ""derived in haec verba from Title VII.""  Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S.
575, 584, 55 L. Ed. 2d 40, 98 S. Ct. 866 (1978). 4 Our unanimous  [***418]
interpretation of § 703(a)(2) of Title VII in Griggs is therefore a precedent of
compelling importance.

 In Griggs, a case decided four years after the enactment of the ADEA, we
considered whether § 703 of Title VII prohibited an employer ""from requiring a
high school education or passing of a standardized general intelligence test as
a condition of employment in or transfer to jobs when (a) neither standard is
shown to be significantly related to successful job performance, (b) both
requirements operate to disqualify Negroes at a substantially higher rate than
white applicants, and (c) the jobs in question formerly had been filled only by
white employees as part of a longstanding practice of giving preference to
whites.""  401 U.S., at 425-426, 28 L. Ed. 2d 158, 91 S. Ct. 849.  Accepting the
Court of Appeals' conclusion that the employer had adopted the diploma and test
requirements without any intent to discriminate, we held that good faith ""does
not redeem employment procedures or testing mechanisms that operate as 'built-in
headwinds' for minority groups and are unrelated to measuring job capability.""
Id., at 432, 28 L. Ed. 2d 158, 91 S. Ct. 849.

We explained that Congress had ""directed the thrust of the Act to the
consequences of employment practices, not simply the motivation."" Ibid. We
relied on the fact that history is ""filled with examples of men and women who
rendered highly effective performance without the conventional badges of
accomplishment in terms of certificates, diplomas, or degrees.  Diplomas and
tests are useful servants, but  [*235]  Congress has mandated the commonsense
proposition that they are not to become masters of reality.""  Id., at 433, 28 L.
Ed. 2d 158, 91 S. Ct. 849.  And we noted that the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC), which had enforcement responsibility, had issued guidelines
that accorded with our view.   Id., at 433-434, 28 L. Ed. 2d 158, 91 S. Ct. 849.
We thus squarely held that § 703(a)(2) of Title VII did not require a showing of
discriminatory intent. 5

5 The congressional purposes on which we relied in Griggs have a striking
parallel to two important points made in the Wirtz Report.  Just as the Griggs
opinion ruled out discrimination based on racial animus as a problem in that
case, the Wirtz Report concluded that there was no significant discrimination of
that kind so far as older workers are concerned.  Wirtz Report 6.  And just as
Griggs recognized that the high school diploma requirement, which was unrelated
to job performance, had an unfair impact on African-Americans who had received
inferior educational opportunities in segregated schools,  401 U.S., at 430, 28
L. Ed. 2d 158, 91 S. Ct. 849, the Wirtz Report identified the identical obstacle
to the employment of older workers.  ""Any formal employment standard which
requires, for example, a high school diploma will obviously work against the
employment of many older workers--unfairly if, despite his limited schooling, an
older worker's years of experience have given him the relevant equivalent of a
high school education."" Wirtz Report 3.  Thus, just as the statutory text is
identical, there is a remarkable similarity between the congressional goals we
cited in Griggs and those present in the Wirtz Report.

 [**1542]   While our opinion in Griggs relied primarily on the purposes of the
Act, buttressed by the fact that the EEOC had endorsed the same view, we have
subsequently noted that our holding represented the better reading of the
statutory text as well.  See  Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust,  [***419]  487
U.S. 977, 991, 101 L. Ed. 2d 827, 108 S. Ct. 2777 (1988).  Neither § 703(a)(2)
nor the comparable language in the ADEA simply prohibits actions that ""limit,
segregate, or classify"" persons; rather the language prohibits such actions that
""deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely
affect his status as an employee, because of such individual's"" race or age.
Ibid. (explaining that  [HN5] in disparate-impact cases, ""the employer's
practices may be said to 'adversely affect [an individual's status] as an
employee'"" (alteration in original) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(2) [42 USCS
§ 2000e-2(a)(2)])).   [*236]  Thus the text focuses on the effects of the action
on the employee rather than the motivation for the action of the employer. 6

6 In reaching a contrary conclusion, Justice O'Connor ignores key textual
differences between § 4(a)(1), which does not encompass-disparate-impact
liability, and § 4(a)(2).  Paragraph (a)(1) makes it unlawful for an employer
""to fail or refuse to hire . . . any individual . . . because of such
individual's age."" (Emphasis added.) The focus of the paragraph is on the
employer's actions with respect to the targeted individual.  Paragraph (a)(2),
however, makes it unlawful for an employer ""to limit . . . his employees in any
way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment
opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because
of such individual's age."" (Emphasis added.) Unlike in paragraph (a)(1), there
is thus an incongruity between the employer's actions--which are focused on his
employees generally--and the individual employee who adversely suffers because
of those actions.  Thus, an employer who classifies his employees without
respect to age may still be liable under the terms of this paragraph if such
classification adversely affects the employee because of that employee's
age--the very definition of disparate impact. Justice O'Connor is therefore
quite wrong to suggest that the textual differences between the two paragraphs
are unimportant.

 Griggs, which interpreted the identical text at issue here, thus strongly
suggests that a disparate-impact theory should be cognizable under the ADEA. 7
Indeed, for  [**1543]  over two decades  [*237]  after our decision in Griggs,
the Courts of Appeals uniformly interpreted the ADEA as authorizing recovery on
a ""disparate-impact"" theory in appropriate cases. 8 It was only after our
decision in  Hazen  [***420]  Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U.S. 604, 123 L. Ed. 2d
338, 113 S. Ct. 1701 (1993), that some of those courts concluded that the ADEA
did not authorize a disparate-impact theory of liability. 9 Our opinion in Hazen
Paper, however, did not address or comment on the issue we decide today.  In
that case, we held that an employee's allegation that he was discharged shortly
before his pension would have vested did not state a cause of action under a
disparate-treatment theory.  The motivating factor was not, we held, the
employee's age, but rather his years of service, a factor that the ADEA did not
prohibit an employer from considering when terminating  [*238]  an employee.
Id., at 612, 123 L. Ed. 2d 338, 113 S. Ct. 1701. 10 While we noted that
disparate treatment ""captures the essence of what Congress sought to prohibit in
the ADEA,""   id., at 610, 123 L. Ed. 338, 113 S. Ct. 1701, we were careful to
explain that we were not deciding ""whether a disparate impact theory of
liability is available under the ADEA . . . ,"" ibid. In sum, there is nothing in
our opinion in Hazen Paper that precludes an interpretation of the ADEA that
parallels our holding in Griggs.

7 Justice O'Connor reaches a contrary conclusion based on the text of the
statute, the legislative history, and the structure of the statute.  As we
explain above, n 6, supra, her textual reasoning is not persuasive.  Further,
while Congress may have intended to remedy disparate-impact-type situations
through ""noncoercive measures"" in part, there is nothing to suggest that it
intended such measures to be the sole method of achieving the desired result of
remedying practices that had an adverse effect on older workers.  Finally, we
agree that the differences between age and the classes protected in Title VII
are relevant, and that Congress might well have intended to treat the two
differently.  See  post, at 253, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 430 (O'Connor, J., concurring
in judgment).  However, Congress obviously considered those classes of
individuals to be sufficiently similar to warrant enacting identical
legislation, at least with respect to employment practices it sought to
prohibit.  While those differences, coupled with a difference in the text of the
statute such as the RFOA provision, may warrant addressing disparate-impact
claims in the two statutes differently, see  infra, at 240-241, 161 L. Ed. 2d,
at 431-432, it does not justify departing from the plain text and our settled
interpretation of that text.

The Court of Appeals' categorical rejection of disparate-impact liability, like
Justice O'Connor's, rested primarily on the RFOA provision and the majority's
analysis of legislative history. As we have already explained, we think the
history of the enactment of the ADEA, with particular reference to the Wirtz
Report, supports the pre-Hazen Paper consensus concerning disparate-impact
liability.  And Hazen Paper itself contains the response to the concern over the
RFOA provision.

[HN6] The RFOA provision provides that it shall not be unlawful for an employer
""to take any action otherwise prohibited under subsectio[n] (a) . . . where the
differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age discrimination . .
. ."" 81 Stat 603.   [**1544]  In most disparate-treatment cases, if an employer
in fact acted on a factor other than age, the action would not be prohibited
under subsection (a) in the first place.  See  Hazen Paper, 507 U.S., at 609,
123 L. Ed. 2d 338, 113 S. Ct. 1701 (""[T]here is no disparate treatment under the
ADEA when the factor motivating the employer is some feature other than the
employee's age"").  In those disparate-treatment cases, such as in Hazen Paper
itself, the RFOA provision is simply unnecessary to avoid liability under the
ADEA, since there was no prohibited action in the first place.  The RFOA
provision is not, as Justice O'Connor suggests, a ""safe harbor from liability,""
post, at 252, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 429 (emphasis deleted), since there would
[*239]  be no liability under § 4(a).  See  Texas Dep't of Community  [***421]
Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207, 101 S. Ct. 1089 (1981)
(noting, in a Title VII case, that an employer can defeat liability by showing
that the employee was rejected for ""a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason""
without reference to an RFOA provision).

In disparate-impact cases, however, the allegedly ""otherwise prohibited""
activity is not based on age.  Ibid.  [HN7] (""[C]laims that stress 'disparate
impact' [by contrast] involve employment practices that are facially neutral in
their treatment of different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one
group than another . . . "" (quoting  Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324,
335-336, n. 15, 52 L. Ed. 2d 396, 97 S. Ct. 1843 (1977))).   [HN8] It is,
accordingly, in cases involving disparate-impact claims that the RFOA provision
plays its principal role by precluding liability if the adverse impact was
attributable to a nonage factor that was ""reasonable."" Rather than support an
argument that disparate impact is unavailable under the ADEA, the RFOA provision
actually supports the contrary conclusion. 11

certainly could have done so.  For instance, in the Equal Pay Act of 1963, 29
U.S.C. § 206(d)(1) [29 USCS § 206(d)(1)], Congress barred recovery if a pay
differential was based ""on any other factor""--reasonable or unreasonable--""other
than sex."" The fact that Congress provided that employers could use only
reasonable factors in defending a suit under the ADEA is therefore instructive.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Finally, we note that both the Department of Labor, which initially drafted the
legislation, and the EEOC, which is the agency charged by Congress with
responsibility for implementing the statute, 29 U.S.C. § 628 [29 USCS § 628],
have consistently interpreted the ADEA to authorize relief on a disparate-impact
theory.  The initial regulations, while not mentioning disparate impact by name,
nevertheless permitted such claims if the employer relied on a factor that was
not related to age.  29 CFR § 860.103(f)(1)(i) (1970) (barring physical fitness
requirements that were not ""reasonably necessary for the specific  [*240]  work
to be performed"").  See also § 1625.7 (2004) (setting forth the standards for a
disparate-impact claim).

The text of the statute, as interpreted in Griggs, the RFOA provision, and the
EEOC regulations all support petitioners' view.  We therefore conclude that it
was error for the Court of Appeals to hold that the disparate-impact theory of
liability is categorically unavailable under the ADEA.

IV

[***LEdHR3] [3]   [HN9] Two textual differences between the ADEA and Title VII
make it clear that even though both statutes authorize recovery on a
disparate-impact theory, the scope of disparate-impact liability under ADEA is
narrower than under Title VII.  The first is the RFOA provision, which we have
already identified.  The second is the amendment to Title VII contained in the
[**1545]  Civil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat 1071.  One of the purposes of that
amendment was to modify the Court's holding in  Wards Cove Packing Co. v.
Atonio, 490 U.S. 642, 104 L. Ed. 2d 733, 109 S. Ct. 2115 (1989), a case in which
we narrowly construed the employer's exposure to liability on a disparate-impact
theory.  See Civil Rights Act of 1991, § 2, 105 Stat 1071.  While the relevant
1991 amendments expanded  [***422]  the coverage of Title VII, they did not
amend the ADEA or speak to the subject of age discrimination. Hence, Wards Cove'
s pre-1991 interpretation of Title VII's identical language remains applicable
to the ADEA.

Congress' decision to limit the coverage of the ADEA by including the RFOA
provision is consistent with the fact that age, unlike race or other
classifications protected by Title VII, not uncommonly has relevance to an
individual's capacity to engage in certain types of employment.  To be sure,
Congress recognized that this is not always the case, and that society may
perceive those differences to be larger or more consequential than they are in
fact.  However, as Secretary Wirtz noted in his report, ""certain circumstances .
. . unquestionably affect older workers more strongly,  as a  [*241]  group,
than they do younger workers."" Wirtz Report 11.  Thus, it is not surprising that
[HN10] certain employment criteria that are routinely used may be reasonable
despite their adverse impact on older workers as a group.  Moreover, intentional
discrimination on the basis of age has not occurred at the same levels as
discrimination against those protected by Title VII.  While the ADEA reflects
Congress' intent to give older workers employment opportunities whenever
possible, the RFOA provision reflects this historical difference.

[***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR4] [4] Turning to the case before us, we initially note
that petitioners have done little more than point out that the pay plan at issue
is relatively less generous to older workers than to younger workers.  They have
not identified any specific test, requirement, or practice within the pay plan
that has an adverse impact on older workers.  As we held in Wards Cove,  [HN11]
it is not enough to simply allege that there is a disparate impact on workers,
or point to a generalized policy that leads to such an impact.  Rather, the
employee is ""'responsible for isolating and identifying the specific employment
practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical
disparities.'""  490 U.S., at 656, 104 L. Ed. 2d 733, 109 S. Ct. 2115 (quoting
Watson, 487 U.S., at 994, 101 L. Ed. 2d 827, 108 S. Ct. 2777; (emphasis added))
Petitioners have failed to do so.  Their failure to identify the specific
practice being challenged is the sort of omission that could ""result in
employers being potentially liable for 'the myriad of innocent causes that may
lead to statistical imbalances . . . .'""  490 U.S., at 657, 104 L. Ed. 2d 733,
109 S. Ct. 2115.  In this case not only did petitioners thus err by failing to
identify the relevant practice, but it is also clear from the record that the
City's plan was based on reasonable factors other than age.

[***LEdHR2A]  The plan divided each of five basic positions--police officer,
master police officer, police sergeant, police lieutenant, and deputy police
chief--into a series of steps and half-steps.  The wage for each range was based
on a survey of comparable communities in the Southeast.  Employees were then
assigned a step (or half-step) within their position that corresponded  [*242]
to the lowest step that would still give the individual a 2% raise.  Most of the
officers were in the three lowest ranks; in each of those ranks there were
officers under age 40 and officers over 40.  In none did their age affect their
compensation.  The few officers in the two highest ranks are all over 40.  Their
raises, though higher in dollar amount than the raises given to  [**1546]
junior officers,  [***423]  represented a smaller percentage of their salaries,
which of course are higher than the salaries paid to their juniors.  They are
members of the class complaining of the ""disparate impact"" of the award.

Petitioners' evidence established two principal facts: First, almost two-thirds
(66.2%) of the officers under 40 received raises of more than 10% while less
than half (45.3%) of those over 40 did. 12 Second, the average percentage
increase for the entire class of officers with less than five years of tenure
was somewhat higher than the percentage for those with more seniority. 13
Because older officers tended to occupy more senior positions, on average they
received smaller increases when measured as a percentage of their salary. The
basic explanation for the differential was the City's perceived need to raise
the salaries of junior officers to make them competitive with comparable
positions in the market.

Thus, the disparate impact is attributable to the City's decision to give raises
based on seniority and position.  Reliance on seniority and rank is
unquestionably reasonable given the City's goal of raising employees' salaries
to match those in surrounding communities.  In sum"

This case presents the question whether Title III of the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 104 Stat. 353, 42 U.S.C. § 12181 et seq.  ,
applies to foreign-flag cruise ships in United States waters. The Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held Title III did not apply because of a
presumption, which it sought to derive from this Court's case law, that, absent
a clear indication of congressional intent, general statutes do not apply to
foreign-flag ships.   356 F.3d 641, 644-646 (2004).  The Court of Appeals for
the Eleventh Circuit, on the other hand, has held that the ADA does apply to
foreign-flag cruise ships in United States waters. See  Stevens v. Premier
Cruises, Inc., 215 F.3d 1237 (2000).  We granted certiorari to resolve the
conflict.   542 U.S. ___, 542 U.S. 965, 159 L. Ed. 2d 856, 125 S. Ct. 26 (2004).

Our cases hold that  [HN1] a clear statement of congressional intent is
necessary before a general statutory requirement can interfere with matters that
concern a foreign-flag vessel's internal affairs and operations, as contrasted
with statutory requirements [**2175]  that concern the security and well-being
of United States citizens or territory.  [HN2] While the clear statement rule
could limit Title III's application to foreign-flag cruise ships in some
instances, when it requires removal of physical barriers, it would appear the
rule is inapplicable to many other duties Title III might impose.  We therefore
reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that the ADA
is altogether inapplicable to foreign vessels; and we remand for further
proceedings.

[*126]  I

The respondent Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd.  (NCL), a Bermuda Corporation with a
principal place of business in Miami, Florida, operates cruise ships that depart
from, and return to, ports in the United States.  The ships are essentially
floating resorts.  They provide passengers with staterooms or cabins, food, and
entertainment.  The cruise ships stop at different ports of call where
passengers may disembark.  Most of the passengers on these cruises are United
States residents; under the  [***106]  terms and conditions of the tickets,
disputes between passengers and NCL are to be governed by United States law; and
NCL relies upon extensive advertising in the United States to promote its
cruises and increase its revenues.

Despite the fact that the cruises are operated by a company based in the United
States, serve predominately United States residents, and are in most other
respects United States-centered ventures, almost all of NCL's cruise ships are
registered in other countries, flying so-called flags of convenience.  The two
NCL cruise ships that are the subject of the present litigation, the Norwegian
Sea and the Norwegian Star, are both registered in the Bahamas.

The petitioners are disabled individuals and their companions who purchased
tickets in 1998 or 1999 for round-trip cruises on the Norwegian Sea or the
Norwegian Star, with departures from Houston, Texas.  Naming NCL as the
defendant, the petitioners filed a class action in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Texas on behalf of all persons similarly
situated.  They sought declaratory and injunctive relief under Title III of the
ADA, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability.  The petitioners
asserted that cruise ships are covered both by Title III's prohibition on
discrimination in places of ""public accommodation,"" § 12182(a), and by its
prohibition on discrimination in ""specified public transportation services,"" §
12184(a).   [HN3] Both provisions require covered entities to make ""reasonable
[*127]  modifications in policies, practices, or procedures"" to accommodate
disabled individuals, §§ 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii), 12184(b)(2)(A), and require removal
of ""architectural barriers, and communication barriers that are structural in
nature"" where such removal is ""readily achievable,"" §§ 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv) ,
12184(b)(2)(C).

The District Court held that, as a general matter, Title III applies to
foreign-flag cruise ships in United States territorial waters. Civ. Action No.
H-00-2649 (SD Tex., Sept. 10, 2002), App. to Pet. for Cert. 35a.  The District
Court found, however, that the petitioners' claims regarding physical barriers
to access could not go forward because the agencies charged with promulgating
architectural and structural guidelines for ADA compliance (the Architectural
and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, the Department of Transportation,
and the Department of Justice) had not done so for cruise ships. In these
circumstances, the court held, it is unclear what structural modifications NCL
would need to make.  Id., at 36a-42a.  The District Court granted NCL's motion
to dismiss [**2176]  the barrier-removal claims, but denied NCL's motion with
respect to all the other claims.  Id., at 47a.

The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in
part.  It reasoned that our cases, particularly  Benz v. Compania Naviera
Hidalgo, S. A., 353 U.S. 138, 1 L. Ed. 2d 709, 77 S. Ct. 699 (1957), and
McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros de Honduras, 372 U.S. 10, 9 L. Ed.
2d 547, 83 S. Ct. 671 (1963) , stand for the proposition that general statutes
do not apply to foreign-flag vessels in United States territory absent a clear
indication of congressional intent.  356 F.3d at 644 (""[T]o apply domestic law
to foreign vessels entering United States waters, there must be present the
affirmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed""  [***107]  (quoting
Benz, supra, at 147, 1 L. Ed. 2d 709, 77 S. Ct. 699 (internal quotation marks
omitted));  356 F.3d at 646 (Benz and McCulloch ""prohibit United States courts
from applying domestic statutes to foreign-flagged ships without specific
evidence  [*128]  of congressional intent"").  As Title III does not contain a
specific provision mandating its application to foreign-flag vessels, the Court
of Appeals sustained the District Court's dismissal of the petitioners'
barrier-removal claims on this alternative ground and reversed the District
Court on the remaining Title III claims.   356 F.3d at 650-651.

The action was ordered dismissed for failure to state a claim, Fed. Rule Civ.
Proc. 12(b)(6), before extensive discovery.  We cannot then discuss the specific
allegations in much detail but must confine our opinion to the relevant general
principles.  (On November 24, 2004, the responsible agencies finally did issue
draft guidelines for large passenger vessels and a Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking.  See  69 Fed. Reg. 69244, 69249.  These developments are not
dispositive of the legal question on which we granted certiorari, and we do not
address how they might affect the ultimate resolution of the petitioners'
claims.)

[HN4] Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination against the disabled in the
full and equal enjoyment of public accommodations, 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a), and
public transportation services, § 12184(a).   [HN5] The general prohibitions are
supplemented by various, more specific requirements.  Entities that provide
public accommodations or public transportation: (1) may not impose ""eligibility
criteria"" that tend to screen out disabled individuals, §§ 12182(b)(2)(A)(i),
12184(b)(1); (2) must make ""reasonable modifications in polices, practices, or
procedures, when such modifications are necessary"" to provide disabled
individuals full and equal enjoyment, §§ 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii), 12184(b)(2)(A); (3)
must provide auxiliary aids and services to disabled individuals, §§
12182(b)(2)(A)(iii), 12184(b)(2)(B); and (4) must remove architectural and
structural barriers, or if barrier removal is  [*129]  not readily achievable,
must ensure equal access for the disabled through alternative methods, §§
12182(b)(2)(A)(iv)-(v), 12184(b)(2)(C).  [HN6]

These specific requirements, in turn, are subject to important exceptions and
limitations.  Eligibility criteria that screen out disabled individuals are
permitted when ""necessary for the provision"" of the services or facilities being
offered, §§ 12182(b)(2)(A)(i), 12184(b)(1).  Policies, practices, and procedures
need not be modified, and auxiliary aids need not be provided, if doing so would
""fundamentally alter"" the services or accommodations being offered.  §§
12182(b)(2)(A)(ii)-(iii).  Auxiliary aids are also unnecessary when they would
""result in an undue burden,""  [**2177]  § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iii).  As we have
noted, moreover, the barrier removal and alternative access requirements do not
apply when these requirements are not ""readily achievable,"" §§
12182(b)(2)(A)(iv)-(v).  Additionally,  [HN7] Title III does not impose
nondiscrimination or accommodation requirements if, as a result, disabled
individuals would pose ""a significant risk to the health or safety of others
[***108]  that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or
procedures or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services,"" § 12182(b)(3).

[***LEdHR1] [1]  [***LEdHR2] [2] Although the statutory definitions of ""public
accommodation"" and ""specified public transportation"" do not expressly mention
cruise ships, there can be no serious doubt that the NCL cruise ships in
question fall within both definitions under conventional principles of
interpretation.  §§ 12181(7)(A)-(B),(I),(L), 12181(10).  The Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit, nevertheless, held that Title III does not apply to
foreign-flag cruise ships in United States waters because the statute has no
clear statement or explicit text mandating coverage for these ships.  [HN8] This
Court's cases, particularly Benz and McCulloch, do hold, in some circumstances,
that a general statute will not apply to certain aspects of the internal
operations of foreign vessels temporarily in United States waters, absent a
clear statement.  The  [*130]  broad clear statement rule adopted by the Court
of Appeals, however, would apply to every facet of the business and operations
of foreign-flag ships. That formulation is inconsistent with the Court's case
law and with sound principles of statutory interpretation.

2

[HN9] This Court has long held that general statutes are presumed to apply to
conduct that takes place aboard a foreign-flag vessel in United States territory
if the interests of the United States or its citizens, rather than interests
internal to the ship, are at stake.  See  Cunard S. S. Co. v. Mellon, 262 U.S.
100, 127, 67 L. Ed. 894, 43 S. Ct. 504, T.D. 3474 (1923) (holding that the
general terms of the National Prohibition Act apply to foreign-flag ships in
United States waters because ""[t]here is in the act no provision making it
inapplicable"" to such ships);  Uravic v. F. Jarka Co., 282 U.S. 234, 240, 75 L.
Ed. 312, 51 S. Ct. 111 (1931) (holding that ""general words"" should be ""generally
applied"" and that therefore there is ""no reason for limiting the liability for
torts committed [aboard foreign-flag ships in United States territory] when they
go beyond the scope of discipline and private matters that do not interest the
territorial power"").  The general rule that United States statutes apply to
foreign-flag ships in United States territory is subject only to a narrow
exception.  Absent a clear statement of congressional intent, general statutes
may not apply to foreign-flag vessels insofar as they regulate matters that
involve only the internal order and discipline of the vessel, rather than the
peace of the port. This qualification derives from the understanding that, as a
matter of international comity, ""all matters of discipline and all things done
on board which affec[t] only the vessel or those belonging to her, and [do] not
involve the peace or dignity of the country, or the tranquility of the port,
should be left by the local government to be dealt with by the authorities of
the nation to which the vessel belonged.""  Wildenhus's Case, 120 U.S. 1, 12, 30
L. Ed. 565, 7 S. Ct. 385 (1887).  This exception to the usual presumption,
however, does not extend beyond  [*131]  matters of internal order and
discipline.   [HN10] ""[I]f crimes are committed on board [a foreign-flag vessel]
of a character to disturb the peace and tranquility of the country to which the
vessel has been brought, the offenders have never by comity [**2178]  or usage
been entitled to any  [***109]  exemption from the operation of the local laws.""
Ibid.

The two cases in recent times in which the presumption against applying general
statutes to foreign vessels' internal affairs has been invoked, Benz and
McCulloch, concern labor relations. The Court held that the general terms of the
National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 49 Stat. 449, 29 U.S.C. § 151 et seq., did
not govern the respective rights and duties of a foreign ship and its crew
because the NLRA standards would interfere with the foreign vessel's internal
affairs in those circumstances.  These cases recognized a narrow rule,
applicable only to statutory duties that implicate the internal order of the
foreign vessel rather than the welfare of American citizens.   McCulloch, 372
U.S., at 21, 9 L. Ed. 2d 547, 83 S. Ct. 671 (holding that  [HN11] ""the law of
the flag state ordinarily governs the internal affairs of a ship"" (emphasis
added)); see also  Benz, 353 U.S., at 146-147, 1 L. Ed. 2d 709, 77 S. Ct. 699.
The Court held the NLRA inapplicable to labor relations between a foreign vessel
and its foreign crew not because foreign ships are generally exempt from the
NLRA, but because the particular application of the NLRA would interfere with
matters that concern only the internal operations of the ship. In contrast, the
Court held that the NLRA is fully applicable to labor relations between a
foreign vessel and American longshoremen because this relationship, unlike the
one between a vessel and its own crew, does not implicate a foreign ship's
internal order and discipline.   Longshoremen v. Ariadne Shipping Co., 397 U.S.
195, 198-201, 25 L. Ed. 2d 218, 90 S. Ct. 872 (1970).

This narrow clear statement rule is supported by sound principles of statutory
construction.  It is reasonable to presume Congress intends no interference with
matters that are primarily of concern only to the ship and the foreign state
[*132]  in which it is registered.  It is also reasonable, however, to presume
Congress does intend its statutes to apply to entities in United States
territory that serve, employ, or otherwise affect American citizens, or that
affect the peace and tranquility of the United States, even if those entities
happen to be foreign-flag ships.

Cruise ships flying foreign flags of convenience offer public accommodations and
transportation services to over 7 million United States residents annually,
departing from and returning to ports located in the United States.  Large
numbers of disabled individuals, many of whom have mobility impairments that
make other kinds of vacation travel difficult, take advantage of these cruises
or would like to do so.  To hold there is no Title III protection for disabled
persons who seek to use the amenities of foreign cruise ships would be a harsh
and unexpected interpretation of a statute designed to provide broad protection
for the disabled. § 12101.  The clear statement rule adopted by the Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, moreover,  would imply that other general federal
statutes--including, for example, Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78
Stat. 243, 42 U.S.C. § 2000a et seq--would not apply aboard foreign cruise ships
in United States waters. A clear statement rule with this sweeping application
is unlikely to reflect congressional intent.

The relevant category for which the Court demands a clear congressional
[***110]  statement, then, consists not of all applications of a statute to
foreign-flag vessels but only those applications that would interfere with the
foreign vessel's internal affairs. This proposition does not mean the clear
statement rule is irrelevant to the ADA, however.  If Title III by its terms
does impose duties that interfere with a foreign-flag cruise ship's internal
affairs, the lack [**2179]  of a clear congressional statement can mean that
those specific applications of Title III are precluded.  On remand, the Court of
Appeals may need to consider which, if any, Title III requirements interfere
[*133]  with the internal affairs of foreign-flag vessels. As we will discuss
further, however, Title III's own limitations and qualifications may make this
inquiry unnecessary.

B

1

The precise content of the category ""internal affairs"" (or, as it is variously
denoted in the case law, ""internal order"" or ""internal operations"") is difficult
to define with precision.  There is, moreover, some ambiguity in our cases as to
whether the relevant category of activities is restricted to matters that affect
only the internal order of the ship when there is no effect on United States
interests, or whether the clear statement rule further comes into play if the
predominant effect of a statutory requirement is on a foreign ship's internal
affairs but the requirement also promotes the welfare of United States residents
or territory. We need not attempt to define the relevant protected category with
precision.  It suffices to observe that the guiding principles in determining
whether the clear statement rule is triggered are the desire for international
comity and the presumed lack of interest by the territorial sovereign in matters
that bear no substantial relation to the peace and tranquility of the port.

It is plain that Title III might impose any number of duties on cruise ships
that have nothing to do with a ship's internal affairs. The pleadings and briefs
in this case illustrate, but do not exhaust, the ways a cruise ship might offend
such a duty.  The petitioners allege NCL charged disabled passengers higher
fares and required disabled passengers to pay special surcharges, Plaintiffs'
First Amended Original Complaint in No. H-00-2649 (SD Tex.), P 32, App. 15
(hereinafter Complaint); Brief for Petitioners 17-20; maintained evacuation
programs and equipment in locations not accessible to disabled individuals,
Complaint P 19, App. 12; Brief for Petitioners 21; required disabled
individuals, but  [*134]  not other passengers, to waive any potential medical
liability and to travel with a companion, id., at 8, 17-18; and reserved the
right to remove from the ship any disabled individual whose presence endangers
the ""comfort"" of other passengers, id., at 8, 20.  The petitioners also allege
more generally that NCL ""failed to make reasonable modifications in policies,
practices, and procedures"" necessary to ensure the petitioners' full enjoyment
of the services NCL offered.  Complaint P 30, App. 15.  These are bare
allegations, and their truth is not conceded.  We express no opinion on the
factual support for those claims.  We can say,  however, that none of these
alleged Title III violations implicate any requirement that would interfere with
the internal affairs  [***111]  and management of a vessel as our cases have
employed that term.

At least one subset of the petitioners' allegations, however, would appear to
involve requirements that might be construed as relating to the internal affairs
of foreign-flag cruise ships. These allegations concern physical barriers to
access on board.  For example, according to the petitioners, most of the cabins
on the respondent's cruise ships, including the most attractive cabins in the
most desirable locations, are not accessible to disabled passengers. Brief for
Petitioners 17-18; Complaint P 16, App. 11.  The petitioners also allege that
the ships' coamings--the raised edges around their doors--make many areas of
[**2180] the ships inaccessible to mobility-impaired passengers who use
wheelchairs or scooters.  Brief for Petitioners 24.  Removal of these and other
access barriers, the petitioners suggest, may be required by Title III's
structural barrier removal requirement, §§ 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv), 12184(b)(2)(C).

Although these physical barriers affect the passengers as well as the ship and
its crew, the statutory requirement could mandate a permanent and significant
alteration of a physical feature of the ship--that is, an element of basic ship
design  [*135]  and construction.  If so, these applications of the barrier
removal requirement likely would interfere with the internal affairs of foreign
ships. A permanent and significant modification to a ship's physical structure
goes to fundamental issues of ship design and construction, and it might be
impossible for a ship to comply with all the requirements different
jurisdictions might impose.  The clear statement rule would most likely come
into play if Title III were read to require permanent and significant structural
modifications to foreign vessels. It is quite a different question, however,
whether Title III would require this.  The Title III requirements that might
impose permanent and substantial changes to a ship's architecture and design,
are, like all of Title III's requirements, subject to the statute's own specific
limitations and qualifications.  These limitations may make resort to the clear
statement rule unnecessary.

2

[***LEdHR3] [3] Title III requires barrier removal if it is ""readily
achievable,"" § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv).  The statute defines that term as ""easily
accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense,"" §
12181(9). Title III does not define ""difficulty"" in § 12181(9), but use of the
disjunctive--""easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much
difficulty or expense""--indicates that it extends to considerations in addition
to cost.  Furthermore, Title III directs that the ""readily achievable""
determination take into account ""the impact . . . upon the operation of the
facility,"" § 12181(9)(B).

[***LEdHR4] [4] Surely a barrier removal requirement under Title III that would
bring a vessel into noncompliance with the International Convention for the
Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), Nov. 1, 1974, [1979-1980],  32 U. S. T. 47, T. I.
A. S. No. 9700, or any other international legal obligation, would create
serious difficulties for the vessel and would have a substantial impact  [*136]
on its operation, and thus would not be ""readily achievable."" This understanding
of the statute, urged by the United States, is eminently reasonable.  Brief as
Amicus [***112]  Curiae 27-28; ADA Title III Technical Assistance Manual
III-1.2000(D) (Supp 1994), available at
http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/ada/taman3up.html (as visited May 31, 2005, and
available in Clerk of Court's case file);  56 Fed. Reg. 45600 (1991).  If,
moreover, Title III's ""readily achievable"" exemption were not to take conflicts
with international law into account, it would lead to the anomalous result that
American cruise ships are obligated to comply with Title III even if doing so
brings them into noncompliance with SOLAS, whereas foreign ships--which unlike
American ships have the benefit of the internal affairs clear statement
rule--would not be so obligated.  Congress could not have intended this result.

It is logical and proper to conclude, moreover, that whether a barrier
modification is ""readily achievable"" under Title III must take into
consideration the modification's effect on shipboard safety.  A separate
provision of Title III mandates [**2181]  that the statute's nondiscrimination
and accommodation requirements do not apply if disabled individuals would pose
""a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated
by a modification of policies, practices, or procedures or by the provision of
auxiliary aids or services,"" § 12182(b)(3).  This reference is to a safety
threat posed by a disabled individual, whereas here the question would be
whether the structural modification itself may pose the safety threat.  It would
be incongruous, nevertheless, to attribute to Congress an intent to require
modifications that threaten safety to others simply because the threat comes not
from the disabled person but from the accommodation itself.  The anomaly is
avoided by concluding that a structural modification is not readily achievable
within the meaning of § 12181(9) if it would pose a direct threat to the health
or safety of others.

[*137]  3

Because Title III does not require structural modifications that would conflict
with international legal obligations or pose any real threat to the safety of
the crew or other passengers, it may well follow--though we do not decide the
question here--that Title III does not require any permanent and significant
structural modifications that interfere with the internal affairs of any cruise
ship, foreign flag or domestic. If that is indeed the case, recourse to the
clear statement rule would not be necessary.

Cases may arise, however, where it is prudent for a court to turn first to the
internal affairs clear statement rule rather than deciding the precise scope and
operation of the statute.  Suppose, for example, it is a difficult question
whether a particular Title III barrier removal requirement is readily
achievable, but the requirement does entail a permanent and significant
structural modification, interfering with a foreign ship's internal affairs. In
that case a court sensibly could invoke the clear statement rule without
determining whether Title III actually imposes the requirement.  On the other
hand, there may be many cases where it is not obvious that a particular physical
modification relates to a vessel's basic architecture and construction, but it
is clear the modification would conflict with SOLAS or some other international
legal obligation.  In those cases, a court may deem it appropriate  [***113]  to
hold that the physical barrier modification in question is not readily
achievable, without resort to the clear statement rule.

III

A

In light of the preceding analysis, it is likely that under a proper
interpretation of ""readily achievable"" Title III would impose no requirements
that interfere with the internal affairs of foreign-flag cruise ships. If Title
III did impose a duty that required cruise ships to make permanent and
significant  [*138]  structural modifications that did not conflict with
international law or threaten safety, or if the statute otherwise interfered
with a foreign ship's internal affairs, the clear statement rule recognized in
Benz and McCulloch would come into play at that point.  The Title III
requirement in question, however, would still apply to domestic cruise ships,
and Title III requirements having nothing to do with internal affairs would
continue to apply to domestic and foreign ships alike.

This application-by-application use of the internal affairs clear statement rule
is consistent with how the rule has traditionally operated.  In Benz and
McCulloch, the Court concluded that the NLRA did not apply to labor relations
between a foreign-flag ship and its foreign crew because of interference with
the foreign [**2182]  ships' internal affairs. In Ariadne Shipping, however, the
Court held that the NLRA does apply to labor relations between a foreign-flag
ship and American longshoremen.  Ariadne Shipping acknowledged the clear
statement rule invoked in Benz and McCulloch but held that the ""considerations
that informed the Court's construction of the statute in [those cases] are
clearly inapplicable"" to the question whether the statute applies to foreign
ships' labor relations with American longshoremen.   397 U.S., at 199, 25 L. Ed.
2d 218, 90 S. Ct. 872.  Ariadne Shipping held that the longshoremen's
""short-term, irregular and casual connection with the [foreign] vessels plainly
belied any involvement on their part with the ships' 'internal discipline and
order.'""  Id., at 200, 25 L. Ed. 2d 218, 90 S. Ct. 872.  Therefore, application
of the NLRA to foreign ships' relations with American longshoremen ""would have
threatened no interference in the internal affairs of foreign-flag ships."" Ibid.
If the clear statement rule restricts some applications of the NLRA to foreign
ships (e.g., labor relations with the foreign crew), but not others (e.g., labor
relations with American longshoremen), it follows that the case-by-case
application is also required under Title III of the ADA.  The rule, where it is
even necessary to invoke it, would restrict  [*139]  some applications of Title
III to foreign ships (e.g., certain structural barrier modification
requirements), but not others (e.g., the prohibition on discriminatory ticket
pricing).

The internal affairs clear statement rule is an implied limitation on otherwise
unambiguous general terms of the statute.  It operates much like the principle
that general statutes are construed not to apply extraterritorially,  EEOC v.
Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 260, 113 L. Ed. 2d 274, 111 S. Ct. 1227
(1991), or the rule that general statutes are presumed not to impose monetary
liability on nonconsenting States,  Atascadero State Hospital v.  [***114]

"            THOMAS JOE MILLER-EL, Petitioner v. DOUG DRETKE, DIRECTOR,                TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL                              INSTITUTIONS DIVISION",545 U.S. 231,"

 [**2322]  [*235]   Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A] Two years ago, we ordered that a certificate of appealability,
under 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c), be issued to habeas petitioner Miller-El, affording
review of the District Court's rejection of the claim that prosecutors  [***211]
in his capital murder trial made peremptory strikes of potential jurors based on
race.  Today we find Miller-El entitled to prevail on that claim and order
relief under § 2254.

I

In the course of robbing a Holiday Inn in Dallas, Texas, in late 1985, Miller-El
and his accomplices bound and gagged  [*236]  two hotel employees, whom
Miller-El then shot, killing one and severely injuring the other.  During jury
selection in Miller-El's trial for capital murder, prosecutors used peremptory
strikes against 10 qualified black venire members.  Miller-El objected that the
strikes were based on race and could not be presumed legitimate,  given a
history of excluding black members from criminal juries by the Dallas County
District Attorney's Office.  The trial court received evidence of the practice
alleged but found no ""systematic exclusion of blacks as a matter of policy"" by
that office, App. 882-883, and therefore no entitlement to relief under  Swain
v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 202, 13 L. Ed. 2d 759, 85 S. Ct. 824 (1965), the case then
defining and marking the limits of relief from racially biased jury selection.
The court denied Miller-El's request to pick a new jury, and the trial ended
with his death sentence for capital murder.

While an appeal was pending, this Court decided  Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S.
79, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712 (1986), which replaced  Swain's threshold
requirement to prove systemic discrimination under a Fourteenth Amendment jury
claim, with the rule that discrimination by the [**2323]  prosecutor in
selecting the defendant's jury sufficed to establish the constitutional
violation.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals then remanded the matter to the
trial court to determine whether Miller-El could show that prosecutors in his
case peremptorily struck prospective black jurors because of race.   Miller-El
v. State, 748 S.W.2d 459 (1988) (en banc).

The trial court found no such demonstration.  After reviewing the voir dire
record of the explanations given for some of the challenged strikes, and after
hearing one of the prosecutors, Paul Macaluso, give his justification for those
previously unexplained, the trial court accepted the stated race-neutral reasons
for the strikes, which the judge called ""completely credible [and] sufficient""
as the grounds for a finding of ""no purposeful discrimination."" Findings of Fact
and Conclusions of Law Upon Remand from the Court of Criminal Appeals in State
v. Miller-El, No. 8668-NL (5th Crim. Dist. Ct., Dallas County, Tex., Jan. 13,
1989), pp 5-6,  [*237]  App. 928-929.  The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed,
stating it found ""ample support"" in the voir dire record for the race-neutral
explanations offered by prosecutors for the peremptory strikes.  Miller-El v.
State, No. 69,677 (Sept. 16, 1992) (per curiam), p 2, App. 931.

Miller-El then sought habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2254, again pressing his
Batson claim, among others not now before us.   The District Court denied
relief,  Miller-El v. Johnson, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7763, Civil No.
3:96-CV-1992-H (ND Tex., June 5, 2000), App. 987, and the Court of Appeals for
the Fifth Circuit precluded appeal by denying a certificate of appealability,
Miller-El v. Johnson, 261 F.3d 445 (2001).  We granted certiorari to consider
whether Miller-El was entitled to review on the Batson claim,  Miller-El
[***212]  v. Cockrell, 534 U.S. 1122, 151 L. Ed. 2d 963, 122 S. Ct. 981 (2002),
and reversed the Court of Appeals.  After examining the record of Miller-El's
extensive evidence of purposeful discrimination by the Dallas County District
Attorney's Office before and during his trial, we found an appeal was in order,
since the merits of the Batson claim were, at the least, debatable by jurists of
reason.   Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 154 L. Ed. 2d 931, 123 S. Ct.
1029 (2003).  After granting a certificate of appealability, the Fifth Circuit
rejected Miller-El's Batson claim on the merits.   361 F.3d 849 (2004).  We
again granted certiorari,  542 U.S. 936, 542 U.S. 936, 159 L. Ed. 2d 811, 124 S.
Ct. 2908 (2004), and again we reverse.

[HN1] ""It is well known that prejudices often exist against particular classes
in the community, which sway the judgment of jurors, and which, therefore,
operate in some cases to deny to persons of those classes the full enjoyment of
that protection which others enjoy.""  Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303,
309, 25 L. Ed. 664 (1880); see also  Batson v. Kentucky, supra, at 86, 90 L. Ed.
2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712.  Defendants are harmed, of course, when racial
discrimination in jury selection compromises the right of trial by impartial
jury,  Strauder v. West Virginia, supra, at 308, 25 L. Ed. 664, but racial
minorities are harmed more generally, for prosecutors  [*238]  drawing racial
lines in picking juries establish ""state-sponsored group stereotypes rooted in,
and reflective of, historical prejudice,""  J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B.,
511 U.S. 127, 128, 128 L. Ed. 2d 89, 114 S. Ct. 1419 (1994).

Nor is the harm confined to minorities.  When the government's choice of jurors
is tainted with racial bias, that ""overt wrong . . . casts doubt over the
obligation of the parties, the jury, and [**2324]  indeed the court to adhere to
the law throughout the trial . . . .""  Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 412, 113 L.
Ed. 2d 411, 111 S. Ct. 1364 (1991).  That is, the very integrity of the courts
is jeopardized when a prosecutor's discrimination ""invites cynicism respecting
the jury's neutrality,"" ibid., and undermines public confidence in adjudication,
Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U.S. 42, 49, 120 L. Ed. 2d 33, 112 S. Ct. 2348 (1992);
Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U.S. 614, 628, 114 L. Ed. 2d 660, 111 S.
Ct. 2077 (1991);  Batson v. Kentucky, supra, at 87, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct.
1712.  So, ""[f]or more than a century, this Court consistently and repeatedly
has reaffirmed that racial discrimination by the State in jury selection offends
the Equal Protection Clause.""  Georgia v. McCollum, supra, at 44, 120 L. Ed. 2d
33, 112 S. Ct. 2348; see  Strauder v. West Virginia, supra, at 308, 310, 25 L.
Ed. 664;  Norris v. Alabama, 294 U.S. 587, 596, 79 L. Ed. 1074, 55 S. Ct. 579
(1935);  Swain v. Alabama, supra, at 223-224, 13 L. Ed. 2d 759, 85 S. Ct. 824;
Batson v. Kentucky, supra, at 84, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712;  Powers v.
Ohio, supra, at 404, 113 L. Ed. 2d 411, 111 S. Ct. 1364.

The rub has been the practical difficulty of ferreting out discrimination in
selections discretionary by nature, and choices subject to myriad legitimate
influences, whatever the race of the individuals on the panel from which jurors
are selected.  In Swain v. Alabama, we tackled the problem  [***213]  of ""the
quantum of proof necessary"" to show purposeful discrimination,  380 U.S., at
205, 13 L. Ed. 2d 759, 85 S. Ct. 824 with an eye to preserving each side's
historical prerogative to make a peremptory strike or challenge, the very nature
of which is traditionally ""without a reason stated,""  id., at 220, 13 L. Ed. 2d
759, 85 S. Ct. 824.  The Swain Court tried to relate peremptory challenge to
equal protection by presuming the legitimacy of prosecutors' strikes except in
the face of a longstanding pattern of discrimination: when ""in case after case,
whatever the circumstances,"" no blacks served on juries,  [*239]  then ""giving
even the widest leeway to the operation of irrational but trial-related
suspicions and antagonisms, it would appear that the purposes of the peremptory
challenge [were] being perverted.""  Id., at 223-224, 13 L. Ed. 2d 759, 85 S. Ct.
824.

Swain's demand to make out a continuity of discrimination over time, however,
turned out to be difficult to the point of unworkable, and in Batson v. Kentucky
, we recognized that this requirement to show an extended pattern imposed a
""crippling burden of proof"" that left prosecutors' use of peremptories ""largely
immune from constitutional scrutiny.""  476 U.S., at 92-93, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106
S. Ct. 1712.  By Batson's day, the law implementing equal protection elsewhere
had evolved into less discouraging standards for assessing a claim of purposeful
discrimination,  id., at 93-95, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712 (citing, e.g.,
Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 48 L. Ed. 2d 597, 96 S. Ct. 2040 (1976), and
Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 50 L.
Ed. 2d 450, 97 S. Ct. 555 (1977)), and we accordingly held that  [HN2] a
defendant could make out a prima facie case of discriminatory jury selection by
""the totality of the relevant facts"" about a prosecutor's conduct during the
defendant's own trial.   Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S., at 94, 96, 90 L. Ed. 2d
69, 106 S. Ct. 1712.  ""Once the defendant makes a prima facie showing, the
burden shifts to the State to come forward with a neutral explanation for
challenging . . . jurors"" within an arguably targeted class.   Id., at 97, 90 L.
Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712.  Although there may be ""any number of bases on which
a prosecutor reasonably [might] believe that it is desirable to strike a juror
who is not excusable for cause . . ., the prosecutor must give a clear and
reasonably specific explanation of his legitimate reasons for exercising the
challeng[e].""  Id., at 98, n. 20, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712 [**2325]
(internal quotation marks omitted).  ""The trial court then will have the duty to
determine if the defendant has established purposeful discrimination.""  Id., at
98, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712.

Although the move from Swain to Batson left a defendant free to challenge the
prosecution without having to cast Swain's wide net, the net was not entirely
consigned to history, for Batson's individualized focus came with a weakness
[*240]  of its own owing to its very emphasis on the particular reasons a
prosecutor might give.  If any facially neutral reason sufficed to answer a
Batson challenge, then Batson would not amount to much more than Swain. Some
stated reasons are false, and although some false reasons are shown up within
the four corners of a given case, sometimes a court may not be sure unless it
looks beyond the case at  [***214]  hand.  Hence Batson's explanation that a
defendant may rely on ""all relevant circumstances"" to raise an inference of
purposeful discrimination.   476 U.S., at 96-97, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct.
1712.

B

This case comes to us on review of a denial of habeas relief sought under 28
U.S.C. § 2254, following the Texas trial court's prior determination of fact
that the State's race-neutral explanations were true, see  Purkett v. Elem, 514
U.S. 765, 769, 131 L. Ed. 2d 834, 115 S. Ct. 1769 (1995) (per curiam);  Batson
v. Kentucky, supra, at 98, n. 21, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712.

[HN3] Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 ,
Miller-El may obtain relief only by showing the Texas conclusion to be ""an
unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in
the State court proceeding."" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2).  Thus we presume the Texas
court's factual findings to be sound unless Miller-El rebuts the ""presumption of
correctness by clear and convincing evidence."" § 2254(e)(1).  The standard is
demanding but not insatiable; as we said the last time this case was here,
""[d]eference does not by definition preclude relief.""  Miller-El v. Cockrell,
537 U.S., at 340, 154 L. Ed. 2d 931, 123 S. Ct. 1029.

III

A

[***LEdHR1A] [1B] The numbers describing the prosecution's use of peremptories
are remarkable.  Out of 20 black members of the 108-person venire panel for
Miller-El's trial, only 1 served.  Although 9 were excused for cause or by
agreement, 10 were  [*241]  peremptorily struck by the prosecution.   Id., at
331, 154 L. Ed. 2d 931, 123 S. Ct. 1029.  ""The prosecutors used their peremptory
strikes to exclude 91% of the eligible African-American venire members . . . .
Happenstance is unlikely to produce this disparity.""  Id., at 342, 154 L. Ed. 2d
931, 123 S. Ct. 1029.

[***LEdHR2] [2]  [***LEdHR3A] [3A] More powerful than these bare statistics,
however, are side-by-side comparisons of some black venire panelists who were
struck and white panelists allowed to serve.   [HN4] If a prosecutor's proffered
reason for striking a black panelist applies just as well to an
otherwise-similar nonblack who is permitted to serve, that is evidence tending
to prove purposeful discrimination to be considered at Batson's third step.  Cf.
Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 147, 147 L. Ed. 2d
105, 120 S. Ct. 2097 (2000) (in employment discrimination cases, ""[p]roof that
the defendant's explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form of
circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination, and it
may be quite persuasive"").  While we did not develop a comparative juror
analysis last time, we did note that the prosecution's reasons for exercising
peremptory strikes against some black panel members appeared [**2326]  equally
on point as to some white jurors who served.   Miller-El v. Cockrell, supra, at
343, 154 L. Ed. 2d 931, 123 S. Ct. 1029. 1 [***215]  The details of two panel
member comparisons bear this out. 2

1 While many of these explanations were offered contemporaneously, ""the state
trial court had no occasion to judge the credibility of these explanations at
that time because our equal protection jurisprudence then, dictated by Swain,
did not require it.""  Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S., at 343, 154 L. Ed. 2d
931, 123 S. Ct. 1029.  Other evidence was presented in the  Batson v. Kentucky,
476 U.S. 79, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712 (1986), hearing, but this was
offered two years after trial and ""was subject to the usual risks of imprecision
and distortion from the passage of time.""  537 U.S., at 343, 154 L. Ed. 2d 931,
123 S. Ct. 1029.

2  [***LEdHR3A] [3B] The dissent contends that comparisons of black and nonblack
venire panelists, along with Miller-El's arguments about the prosecution's
disparate questioning of black and nonblack panelists and its use of jury
shuffles, are not properly before this Court, not having been ""put before the
Texas courts.""  Post, at 279, 162 L. Ed. 2d, 196, 238-239 (opinion of Thomas,
J.).  But the dissent conflates the difference between evidence that must be
presented to the state courts to be considered by federal courts in habeas
proceedings and theories about that evidence.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2)
(state-court factfinding must be assessed ""in light of the evidence presented in
the State court proceeding"");  Miller-El v. Cockrell, supra, at 348 (habeas
petitioner must show unreasonability ""in light of the record before the [state]
court"").  There can be no question that the transcript of voir dire, recording
the evidence on which Miller-El bases his arguments and on which we base our
result, was before the state courts, nor does the dissent contend that Miller-El
did not ""fairly presen[t]"" his Batson claim to the state courts.   Picard v.
Connor, 404 U.S. 270, 275, 30 L. Ed. 2d 438, 92 S. Ct. 509 (1971). Only as to
the juror questionnaires and information cards is there question about what was
before the state courts.  Unlike the dissent, see  post, at 281 - 282, 162 L.
Ed. 2d, at 224, we reach no decision about whether the limitation on evidence in

 [*242]    [***LEdHR4A] [4A] The prosecution used its second peremptory strike
to exclude Billy Jean Fields, a black man who expressed unwavering support for
the death penalty. On the questionnaire filled out by all panel members before
individual examination on the stand, Fields said that he believed in capital
punishment, Joint Lodging 14, and during questioning he disclosed his belief
that the State acts on God's behalf when it imposes the death penalty.
""Therefore, if the State exacts death, then that's what it should be."" App. 174.
He testified that he had no religious or philosophical reservations about the
death penalty and that the death penalty deterred crime.  Id., at 174-175.  He
twice averred, without apparent hesitation, that he could sit on Miller-El's
jury and make a decision to impose this penalty.  Id., at 176-177.

Although at one point in the questioning, Fields indicated that the possibility
of rehabilitation might be relevant to the likelihood that a defendant would
commit future acts of violence, id., at 183, he responded to ensuing questions
by saying that although he believed anyone could be rehabilitated, this belief
would not stand in the way of a decision to impose the death penalty:


     ""[B]ased on what you [the prosecutor] said as far as the crime goes,
     there are only two things that could be rendered, death or life in
     prison.  If for some reason the testimony didn't warrant death, then
     life imprisonment  [*243]  would give an individual an opportunity to
     rehabilitate.  But, you know, you said that the jurors didn't have the
     opportunity to make a personal decision in the matter with reference
     to what I thought or felt, but it was just based on the questions
     according to the way the law has been handed down."" Id., at 185
     (alteration omitted).



 [**2327]  Fields also noted on his questionnaire that his brother had a
criminal history.  Joint Lodging 13.  During questioning, the prosecution went
into this, too:  [***216]


     ""Q Could you tell me a little bit about that?

     ""A He was arrested and convicted on [a] number of occasions for
     possession of a controlled substance.

     ""Q Was that here in Dallas?

     ""A Yes.

     ""Q Was he involved in any trials or anything like that?

     ""A I suppose of sorts.  I don't really know too much about it.

     ""Q Was he ever convicted?

     ""A Yeah, he served time.

     ""Q Do you feel that that would in any way interfere with your service
     on this jury at all?

     ""A No."" App. 190. (alteration omitted).



Fields was struck peremptorily by the prosecution, with prosecutor James Nelson
offering a race-neutral reason:


     ""[W]e . . . have concern with reference to some of his statements as
     to the death penalty in that he said that he could only give death if
     he thought a person could not be rehabilitated and he later made the
     comment that any person could be rehabilitated if they find God or are
     introduced to God and the fact that we have a concern that his
     religious feelings may affect his jury service in this case."" Id., at
     197 (alteration omitted).



 [*244]  Thus, Nelson simply mischaracterized Fields's testimony.  He
represented that Fields said he would not vote for death if rehabilitation was
possible, whereas Fields unequivocally stated that he could impose the death
penalty regardless of the possibility of rehabilitation. Perhaps Nelson
misunderstood, but unless he had an ulterior reason for keeping Fields off the
jury we think he would have proceeded differently.  In light of Fields's
outspoken support for the death penalty, we expect the prosecutor would have
cleared up any misunderstanding by asking further questions before getting to
the point of exercising a strike.

[***LEdHR4A] [4B]  [***LEdHR5A] [5A] If, indeed, Fields's thoughts on
rehabilitation did make the prosecutor uneasy, he should have worried about a
number of white panel members he accepted with no evident reservations.  Sandra
Hearn said that she believed in the death penalty ""if a criminal cannot be
rehabilitated and continues to commit the same type of crime."" Id., at 429. 3
Hearn went so far as to express doubt that at the penalty phase of a capital
case she could conclude that a convicted murderer ""would probably commit some
criminal acts of violence in the future."" Id., at 440.  ""People change,"" she
said, making it hard to assess the risk of someone's future dangerousness.
""[T]he evidence would have to be awful strong."" Ibid. But the prosecution did
not respond to Hearn the way it did to Fields, and without delving into her
views about rehabilitation with any further question, it raised no objection to
her serving on the jury.  White panelist Mary Witt said she would take the
possibility of rehabilitation into account in deciding at the penalty phase of
the trial about a defendant's probability of future dangerousness, 6 Record of
[***217]  Voir Dire 2433 (hereinafter Record), but the prosecutors asked her no
further question about her views on reformation, and [**2328]  they  [*245]
accepted her as a juror, id., at 2464-2465. 4 Latino venireman Fernando
Gutierrez, who served on the jury, said that he would consider the death penalty
for someone who could not be rehabilitated, App. 777, but the prosecutors did
not question him further about this view.  In sum, nonblack jurors whose remarks
on rehabilitation could well have signaled a limit on their willingness to
impose a death sentence were not questioned further and drew no objection, but
the prosecution expressed apprehension about a black juror's belief in the
possibility of reformation even though he repeatedly stated his approval of the
death penalty and testified that he could impose it according to state legal
standards even when the alternative sentence of life imprisonment would give a
defendant (like everyone else in the world) the opportunity to reform. 5

3 Hearn could give the death penalty for murder if the defendant had committed a
prior offense of robbery, in which case she would judge ""according to the
situation,"" App. 430, and she thought the death penalty might be appropriate for
offenses like ""[e]xtreme child abuse,"" ibid.

4  [***LEdHR5A] [5B] Witt ultimately did not serve because she was peremptorily
struck by the defense.  6 Record 2465. The fact that Witt and other venire
members discussed here were peremptorily struck by the defense is not relevant
to our point.  For each of them, the defense did not make a decision to exercise
a peremptory until after the prosecution decided whether to accept or reject, so
each was accepted by the prosecution before being ultimately struck by the
defense.  And the underlying question is not what the defense thought about
these jurors but whether the State was concerned about views on rehabilitation
when the venireperson was not black. The dissent offers other reasons why these
nonblack panel members who expressed views on rehabilitation similar to Fields's
were otherwise more acceptable to the prosecution than he was.  See  post, at
293 - 296, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 247-249.  In doing so, the dissent focuses on
reasons the prosecution itself did not offer.  See  infra, at 252, 162 L. Ed.
2d, at 222.

5 Prosecutors did exercise peremptory strikes on Penny Crowson and Charlotte
Whaley, who expressed views about rehabilitation similar to those of Witt and
Gutierrez.  App. 554, 715.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  [***LEdHR4A] [4C] The unlikelihood that his position on rehabilitation had
anything to do with the peremptory strike of Fields is underscored by the
prosecution's response after Miller-El's lawyer pointed out that the prosecutor
had misrepresented Fields's responses on the subject.  A moment earlier the
prosecutor  [*246]  had finished his misdescription of Fields's views on
potential rehabilitation with the words, ""Those are our reasons for exercising
our . . . strike at this time."" Id., at 197.  When defense counsel called him on
his misstatement, he neither defended what he said nor withdrew the strike.  Id.
, at 198.  Instead, he suddenly came up with Fields's brother's prior conviction
as another reason for the strike.  Id., at 199.

It would be difficult to credit the State's new explanation, which reeks of
afterthought.  While the Court of Appeals tried to bolster it with the
observation that no seated juror was in Fields's position with respect to his
brother,  361 F.3d at 859-860, the court's readiness to accept the State's
substitute reason ignores not only its pretextual timing but the other reasons
rendering it implausible.  Fields's testimony indicated he was not close to his
brother,  App. 190 (""I don't really know too much about it""), and the
prosecution asked nothing further about the influence his brother's history
might have had on Fields, as it probably would have done if the family history
had actually mattered.  See, e.g.,  Ex parte Travis, 776 So. 2d 874, 881 (Ala.
2000) (""[T]he  [HN5] State's failure to engage in any meaningful voir dire
[***218]  examination on a subject the State alleges it is concerned about is
evidence suggesting that the explanation is a sham and a pretext for
discrimination"").  There is no good reason to doubt that the State's
afterthought about Fields's brother was anything but makeweight.

[**2329]  The Court of Appeals's judgment on the Fields strike is unsupportable
for the same reason the State's first explanation is itself unsupportable.  The
Appeals Court's description of Fields's voir dire testimony mentioned only his
statements that everyone could be rehabilitated, failing to note that Fields
affirmed that he could give the death penalty if the law and evidence called for
it, regardless of the possibility of divine grace.  The Court of Appeals made no
mention of the fact that the prosecution mischaracterized Fields as  [*247]
saying he could not give death if rehabilitation were possible.   361 F.3d at
856.

[***LEdHR1A] [1C]  [***LEdHR6A] [6A] In sum, when we look for nonblack jurors
similarly situated to Fields, we find strong similarities as well as some
differences. 6 But the differences seem far from significant, particularly when
we read Fields's voir dire testimony in its entirety.  Upon that reading, Fields
should have been an ideal juror in the eyes of a prosecutor seeking a death
sentence, and the prosecutors' explanations for the strike cannot reasonably be
accepted.  See  Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S., at 339, 154 L. Ed. 2d 931, 123
S. Ct. 1029  [HN6] (the credibility of reasons given can be measured by ""how
reasonable, or how improbable, the explanations are; and by whether the
proffered rationale has some basis in accepted trial strategy"").

6  [***LEdHR6A] [6B] The dissent contends that there are no white panelists
similarly situated to Fields and to panel member Joe Warren because
""'""[s]imilarly situated"" does not mean matching any one of several reasons the
prosecution gave for striking a potential juror--it means matching all of
them.'""  Post, at 291, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 246 (quoting  Miller-El v. Cockrell,
537 U.S., at 362-363, 154 L. Ed. 2d 931, 123 S. Ct. 1029 (Thomas, J.,
dissenting)).  None of our cases announces a rule that no comparison is
probative unless the situation of the individuals compared is identical in all
respects, and there is no reason to accept one.  Nothing in the combination of
Fields's statements about rehabilitation and his brother's history discredits
our grounds for inferring that these purported reasons were pretextual.  A per
se rule that a defendant cannot win a Batson claim unless there is an exactly
identical white juror would leave Batson inoperable; potential jurors are not
products of a set of cookie cutters.

  [***LEdHR7A] [7A] The prosecution's proffered reasons for striking Joe Warren,
another black venireman, are comparably unlikely.  Warren gave this answer when
he was asked what the death penalty accomplished:


     ""I don't know.  It's really hard to say because I know sometimes you
     feel that it might help to deter crime and then you feel that the
     person is not really suffering.  You're taking the suffering away from
     him.  So it's like I said, sometimes you have mixed feelings about
     whether or not this is punishment or, you know, you're  [*248]
     relieving personal punishment."" App. 205; 3 Record 1532.



The prosecution said nothing about these remarks when it struck Warren from the
panel, but prosecutor Paul Macaluso referred to this answer as the first of his
reasons when he testified at the later Batson hearing:


     ""I thought [Warren's statements on voir dire] were inconsistent
     responses.  At one point he says,  [***219]  you know, on a
     case-by-case basis and at another point he said, well, I think--I got
     the impression, at least, that he suggested that the death penalty was
     an easy way out, that they should be made to suffer more."" App. 909.



On the face of it, the explanation is reasonable from the State's point of view,
but its plausibility is severely undercut by the prosecution's failure to object
to other panel members who expressed views much like Warren's.  Kevin Duke, who
served on the jury, said, ""sometimes death would be better to me than--being in
prison would be like dying every d"

 [*377]  [**2460]   Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A] This case calls for specific application of the standard of
reasonable competence required on the part of defense counsel by the Sixth
Amendment.  We hold that even when a capital defendant's family members and the
defendant himself have suggested that no mitigating evidence is available, his
lawyer is bound to make reasonable efforts to obtain and review material that
counsel knows the prosecution will probably rely on as evidence of aggravation
at the sentencing phase of trial.

I

On the morning of January 14, 1988, James Scanlon was discovered dead in a bar
he ran in Allentown, Pennsylvania, his body having been stabbed repeatedly and
set on fire.  Ronald Rompilla was indicted for the murder and related offenses,
and the Commonwealth gave notice of intent to ask  [*378]  for the death
penalty. Two public defenders were assigned to the case.

The jury at the guilt phase of trial found Rompilla guilty on all counts, and
during the ensuing penalty phase, the prosecutor sought to prove three
aggravating factors to justify a death sentence: that the murder was committed
in the course of another felony; that the murder was committed by torture; and
that Rompilla had a significant history of felony convictions indicating the use
or threat of violence. See 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. §§ 9711(d)(6), (8), (9) (2002).
The Commonwealth presented evidence on all three aggravators, and the jury found
all proven.  Rompilla's evidence in mitigation consisted of relatively brief
testimony: five of his family members argued in effect for residual doubt, and
beseeched the jury for mercy, saying that they believed Rompilla was innocent
and a good man.  Rompilla's 14-year-old son testified that he [**2461]  loved
his father and would visit him in prison. The jury acknowledged this evidence to
the point of finding, as two factors in mitigation, that Rompilla's son had
testified on his behalf and that rehabilitation  [***370]  was possible.  But
the jurors assigned the greater weight to the aggravating factors, and sentenced
Rompilla to death.  The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed both conviction
and sentence.  Commonwealth v. Rompilla, 539 Pa. 499, 653 A.2d 626 (1995).

In December 1995, with new lawyers,  Rompilla filed claims under the
Pennsylvania Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 9541 et seq.
(2004), including ineffective assistance by trial counsel in failing to present
significant mitigating evidence about Rompilla's childhood, mental capacity and
health, and alcoholism.  The postconviction court found that trial counsel had
done enough to investigate the possibilities of a mitigation case, and the
Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the denial of relief.  Commonwealth v.
Rompilla, 554 Pa. 378, 721 A.2d 786 (1998).

[*379]  Rompilla then petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. §
2254 in Federal District Court, raising claims that included inadequate
representation.  The District Court found that the State Supreme Court had
unreasonably applied Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674,
104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984), as to the penalty phase of the trial, and granted relief
for ineffective assistance of counsel.  The court found that in preparing the
mitigation case the defense lawyers had failed to investigate ""pretty obvious
signs"" that Rompilla had a troubled childhood and suffered from mental illness
and alcoholism,  and instead had relied unjustifiably on Rompilla's own
description of an unexceptional background.  Rompilla v. Horn, No. CIV.A.99-737
(ED Pa., July 11, 2000), App. 1307-1308.

A divided Third Circuit panel reversed.  Rompilla v. Horn, 355 F.3d 233 (2004).
The majority found nothing unreasonable in the state court's application of
Strickland, given defense counsel's efforts to uncover mitigation material,
which included interviewing Rompilla and certain family members, as well as
consultation with three mental health experts.  Although the majority noted that
the lawyers did not unearth the ""useful information"" to be found in Rompilla's
""school, medical, police, and prison records,"" it thought the lawyers were
justified in failing to hunt through these records when their other efforts gave
no reason to believe the search would yield anything helpful.  355 F.3d at 252.
The panel thus distinguished Rompilla's case from Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S.
510, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471, 123 S. Ct. 2527 (2003).  Whereas Wiggins's counsel
failed to investigate adequately, to the point even of ignoring the leads their
limited enquiry yielded, the Court of Appeals saw the Rompilla investigation as
going far enough to leave counsel with reason for thinking further efforts would
not be a wise use of the limited resources they had.  But Judge Sloviter's
dissent stressed that trial counsel's failure to obtain relevant records on
Rompilla's background was owing to the lawyers' unreasonable reliance on  [*380]
family members and medical experts to tell them what records might be useful.
The Third Circuit denied rehearing en banc by a vote of 6 to 5.  Rompilla v.
Horn, 359 F.3d 310 (2004).

[***371]  We granted certiorari, 542 U.S. 966, 159 L. Ed. 2d 857, 125 S. Ct. 27
(2004), and now reverse. 1

129 L. Ed. 2d 133, 114 S. Ct. 2187 (1994).  It is enough to say that any retrial
of Rompilla's sentence will be governed by the Simmons line of cases.

 [**2462]  II

[HN1]  [***LEdHR2] [2] Under 28 U.S.C. § 2254, Rompilla's entitlement to federal
habeas relief turns on showing that the state court's resolution of his claim of
ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, supra,
""resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable
application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme
Court of the United States,"" § 2254(d)(1).  An ""unreasonable application"" occurs
when a state court ""'identifies the correct governing legal principle from this
Court's decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts' of
petitioner's case.""  Wiggins v. Smith, supra, at 520, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471, 123 S.
Ct. 2527 (quoting Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 413, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389, 120
S. Ct. 1495 (2000) (opinion of O'Connor, J.)).  That is, ""the state court's
decision must have been [not only] incorrect or erroneous [but] objectively
unreasonable.""  Wiggins v. Smith, supra, at 520-521, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471, 123 S.
Ct. 2527 (quoting Williams v. Taylor, supra, at 409, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389, 120 S.
Ct. 1495 (internal quotation marks omitted)).

[HN2]  [***LEdHR3] [3] Ineffective assistance under Strickland is deficient
performance by counsel resulting in prejudice, 466 U.S., at 687, 80 L. Ed. 2d
674, 104 S. Ct. 2052, with performance being measured against an ""objective
standard of reasonableness,"" id., at 688, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 104 S. Ct. 2052
""under prevailing professional norms,"" ibid.; Wiggins v. Smith, supra, at 521,
156 L. Ed. 2d 471, 123 S. Ct. 2527.  This case, like some others recently, looks
[HN3] to norms of adequate investigation in preparing for the sentencing phase
of a capital trial, when defense counsel's job is to counter the  [*381]
State's evidence of aggravated culpability with evidence in mitigation. In
judging the defense's investigation, as in applying Strickland generally,
hindsight is discounted by pegging adequacy to ""counsel's perspective at the
time"" investigative decisions are made, 466 U.S., at 689, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 104
S. Ct. 2052, and by giving a ""heavy measure of deference to counsel's
judgments,"" id., at 691, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 104 S. Ct. 2052.

A

[HN4] A standard of reasonableness applied as if one stood in counsel's shoes
spawns few hard-edged rules, and the merits of a number of counsel's choices in
this case are subject to fair debate.  This is not a case in which defense
counsel simply ignored their obligation to find mitigating evidence, and their
workload as busy public defenders did not keep them from making a number of
efforts, including interviews with Rompilla and some members of his family, and
examinations of reports by three mental health experts who gave opinions at the
guilt phase.  None of the sources proved particularly helpful.

Rompilla's own contributions to any mitigation case were minimal.  Counsel found
him uninterested in  [***372]  helping, as on their visit to his prison to go
over a proposed mitigation strategy, when Rompilla told them he was ""bored being
here listening"" and returned to his cell.  App. 668.  To questions about
childhood and schooling, his answers indicated they had been normal, ibid., save
for quitting school in the ninth grade, id., at 677.  There were times when
Rompilla was even actively obstructive by sending counsel off on false leads.
Id., at 663-664.

The lawyers also spoke with five members of Rompilla's family (his former wife,
two brothers, a sister-in-law, and his son),  [**2463] id., at 494, and counsel
testified that they developed a good relationship with the family in the course
of their representation, id., at 669, 729.  The state postconviction court found
that counsel spoke to the relatives in a ""detailed manner,"" attempting to
unearth mitigating information, id., at 264, although the weight of this finding
is qualified by the  [*382]  lawyers' concession that ""the overwhelming response
from the family was that they didn't really feel as though they knew him all
that well since he had spent the majority of his adult years and some of his
childhood years in custody,"" id., at 495; see also id., at 669.  Defense counsel
also said that because the family was ""coming from the position that [Rompilla]
was innocent . . . they weren't looking for reasons for why he might have done
this."" Id., at 494.

The third and final source tapped for mitigating material was the cadre of three
mental health witnesses who were asked to look into Rompilla's mental state as
of the time of the offense and his competency to stand trial.  Id., at 473-474,
476. But their reports revealed ""nothing useful"" to Rompilla's case, id., at
1358, and the lawyers consequently did not go to any other historical source
that might have cast light on Rompilla's mental condition.

When new counsel entered the case to raise Rompilla's postconviction claims,
however, they identified a number of likely avenues the trial lawyers could
fruitfully have followed in building a mitigation case.  School records are one
example, which trial counsel never examined in spite of the professed
unfamiliarity of the several family members with Rompilla's childhood, and
despite counsel's knowledge that Rompilla left school after the ninth grade.
Id., at 677.  Other examples are records of Rompilla's juvenile and adult
incarcerations, which counsel did not consult, although they were aware of their
client's criminal record.  And while counsel knew from police reports provided
in pretrial discovery that Rompilla had been drinking heavily at the time of his
offense, Lodging to App. 111-120 (hereinafter Lodging), and although one of the
mental health experts reported that Rompilla's troubles with alcohol merited
further investigation, App. 723-724, counsel did not look for evidence of a
history of dependence on alcohol that might have extenuating significance.

[***LEdHR1A] [1B] Before us, trial counsel and the Commonwealth respond to these
unexplored possibilities by emphasizing this Court's  [*383]  recognition that
[HN5] the duty to investigate does not force defense lawyers to scour the globe
on the off chance something will turn up; reasonably diligent counsel may draw a
line when they have good reason to think further investigation would be a waste.
See Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S., at 525, 156 L. Ed.  [***373]  2d 471, 123 S. Ct.
2527 (further investigation excusable where counsel has evidence suggesting it
would be fruitless); Strickland v. Washington, supra, at 699, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674,
104 S. Ct. 2052 (counsel could ""reasonably surmise . . . that character and
psychological evidence would be of little help""); Burger v. Kemp, 483 U.S. 776,
794, 97 L. Ed. 2d 638, 107 S. Ct. 3114 (1987) (limited investigation reasonable
because all witnesses brought to counsel's attention provided predominantly
harmful information).  The Commonwealth argues that the information trial
counsel gathered from Rompilla and the other sources gave them sound reason to
think it would have been pointless to spend time and money on the additional
investigation espoused by postconviction counsel, and we can say that there is
room for debate about trial counsel's obligation to follow at least some of
those potential lines of enquiry.  There is no need to say more, however, for a
further point is clear and dispositive: the lawyers were deficient in failing to
examine the court file on Rompilla's prior conviction.

[**2464]  B

There is an obvious reason that the failure to examine Rompilla's prior
conviction file fell below the level of reasonable performance.  Counsel knew
that the Commonwealth intended to seek the death penalty by proving Rompilla had
a significant history of felony convictions indicating the use or threat of
violence, an aggravator under state law.  Counsel further knew that the
Commonwealth would attempt to establish this history by proving Rompilla's prior
conviction for rape and assault, and would emphasize his violent character by
introducing a transcript of the rape victim's testimony given in that earlier
trial.  App. 665-666.  There is no question that defense counsel were on notice,
since they acknowledge that a ""plea letter,"" written by one of them four days
[*384]  prior to trial, mentioned the prosecutor's plans.  Ibid. It is also
undisputed that the prior conviction file was a public document, readily
available for the asking at the very courthouse where Rompilla was to be tried.

[***LEdHR1A] [1C]  [***LEdHR4A] [4A] It is clear, however, that defense counsel
did not look at any part of that file, including the transcript, until warned by
the prosecution a second time.  In a colloquy the day before the evidentiary
sentencing phase began, the prosecutor again said he would present the
transcript of the victim's testimony to establish the prior conviction.


     ""[DEFENSE]: I would also like to review whatever he's going to read
     from.

     ""[PROSECUTOR]: Well, I told you that I was going to do this a long
     time ago.  You certainly had the opportunity to review the Transcript.

     . . . . .

     ""[DEFENSE]: Well, I would like a copy of this.

     ""[PROSECUTOR]: I don't think that's my duty to provide you with a
     copy.  That's a public record, and you could have gotten that
     Transcript at any time prior to this Trial.  I made one copy for
     myself, and I'd like to have it now.

     ""[DEFENSE]: Well, Judge, then I'm going to need to get a copy of
     [***374]  it.  I'm going to need to get a copy of it.""  Id., at 32,
     36.2

2 A similar exchange took place at the same hearing about the indictment in the
record of Rompilla's prior conviction. ""[DEFENSE]: Well, I think we need to look
at the Indictment then.  If he's charged with committing the Burglary-- . . . .
. ""[PROSECUTOR]: I had a copy, and I forgot to bring it up with me. ""[COURT]:
All right. ""[DEFENSE]: Can we see it, Judge? ""[COURT]: Sure, he's going to get
it. ""[PROSECUTOR]: It's a public record . . . you could have gone over [sic]
lunch and looked at it just like I did."" App. 28.

 [*385]   At the postconviction evidentiary hearing, Rompilla's lawyer confirmed
that she had not seen the transcript before the hearing in which this exchange
took place, id., at 506-507, and crucially, even after obtaining the transcript
of the victim's testimony on the eve of the sentencing hearing, counsel
apparently examined none of the other material in the file. 3

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - Footnotes - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

3  [***LEdHR4A] [4B] Defense counsel also stated at the postconviction hearing
that she believed at some point she had looked at some files regarding that
prior conviction and that she was familiar with the particulars of the case.
But she could not recall what the files were or how she obtained them.  Id., at
507-508.  In addition, counsel apparently obtained Rompilla's rap sheet, which
showed that he had prior convictions, including the one for rape. Id., at 664.
At oral argument, the United States, arguing as an amicus in support of
Pennsylvania, maintained that counsel had fulfilled their obligations to
investigate the prior conviction by obtaining the rap sheet.  Tr. of Oral Arg.
44-45.  But this cannot be so.  The rap sheet would reveal only the charges and
dispositions, being no reasonable substitute for the prior conviction file.  The
dissent nonetheless concludes on this evidence that counsel knew all they needed
to know about the prior conviction. Post, at 401, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 384 (opinion
of Kennedy, J.).  Given counsel's limited investigation into the prior
conviction, the dissent's parsing of the record seems generous to a fault.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  [***LEdHR1A] [1D]  [***LEdHR4A] [4C] With every effort to view the facts as a
defense lawyer would have done at the time, it is difficult to see how counsel
could have failed to realize that without examining the readily available file
they were seriously compromising their opportunity to respond to a case for
aggravation. The prosecution was going to use the dramatic facts of a similar
prior offense, and Rompilla's counsel had a duty to make all reasonable efforts
to learn what they could about the offense.  Reasonable efforts certainly
included obtaining the Commonwealth's own readily available file on the prior
conviction to learn what the Commonwealth knew about the crime, to discover any
mitigating evidence the Commonwealth would downplay, and to anticipate the
details of the aggravating  [*386]  evidence the Commonwealth would emphasize. 4
Without making reasonable efforts to review the file, defense counsel could have
had no hope of knowing whether the prosecution was quoting selectively from the
transcript, or whether there were circumstances extenuating the behavior
described by the victim.  The obligation to get the file was particularly
pressing here owing to the similarity of the violent prior offense to the crime
charged and Rompilla's sentencing strategy stressing residual doubt. Without
making efforts  [***375]  to learn the details and rebut the relevance of the
earlier crime, a convincing argument for residual doubt was certainly beyond any
hope. 5

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - Footnotes - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

4 The ease with which counsel could examine the entire file makes application of
this standard correspondingly easy.  Suffice it to say that when the State has
warehouses of records available in a particular case, review of counsel's
performance will call for greater subtlety.

5  [***LEdHR4A] [4D] This requirement answers the dissent's and the United
States's contention that defense counsel provided effective assistance with
regard to the prior conviction file because it argued that it would be
prejudicial to allow the introduction of the transcript.  Post, at 402, 162 L.
Ed. 2d, at 386-387; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29.   [HN6]
Counsel's obligation to rebut aggravating evidence extended beyond arguing it
ought to be kept out.  As noted above, supra this page, counsel had no way of
knowing the context of the transcript and the details of the prior conviction
without looking at the file as a whole.  Counsel could not effectively rebut the
aggravation case or build their own case in mitigation. Nor is there any merit
to the United States's contention that further enquiry into the prior conviction
file would have been fruitless because the sole reason the transcript was being
introduced was to establish the aggravator that Rompilla had committed prior
violent felonies. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 30.  The Government
maintains that because the transcript would incontrovertibly establish the fact
that Rompilla had committed a violent felony, the defense could not have
expected to rebut that aggravator through further investigation of the file.
That analysis ignores the fact that the sentencing jury was required to weigh
aggravating factors against mitigating factors.  We may reasonably assume that
the jury could give more relative weight to a prior violent felony aggravator
where defense counsel missed an opportunity to argue that circumstances of the
prior conviction were less damning than the prosecution's characterization of
the conviction would suggest.

 [*387]    [***LEdHR1A] [1E] The notion that defense counsel must obtain
information that the State has and will use against the defendant is not simply
a matter of common sense.  As the District Court points out, the American Bar
Association Standards for Criminal Justice in circulation at the time of
Rompilla's trial describes the obligation in terms no one [**2466]  could
misunderstand in the circumstances of a case like this one:


      [HN7] ""It is the duty of the lawyer to conduct a prompt investigation
     of the circumstances of the case and to explore all avenues leading to
     facts relevant to the merits of the case and the penalty in the event
     of conviction.  The investigation should always include efforts to
     secure information in the possession of the prosecution and law
     enforcement authorities.  The duty to investigate exists regardless of
     the accused's admissions or statements to the lawyer of facts
     constituting guilt or the accused's stated desire to plead guilty."" 1

6 The new version of the Standards now reads that any ""investigation should
include efforts to secure information in the possession of the prosecution and
law enforcement authorities"" whereas the version in effect at the time of
Rompilla's trial provided that the ""investigation"" should always include such
efforts.  ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Prosecution Function and Defense
Function 4-4.1 (3d ed. 1993).  We see no material difference between these two
phrasings, and in any case cannot think of any situation in which defense
counsel should not make some effort to learn the information in the possession
of the prosecution and law enforcement authorities.

7 In 1989, shortly after Rompilla's trial, the ABA promulgated a set of
guidelines specifically devoted to setting forth the obligations of defense
counsel in death penalty cases.  ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and
Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases (1989) (hereinafter 1989 ABA
Guidelines or Guideline).  Those Guidelines applied the clear requirements for
investigation set forth in the earlier Standards to death penalty cases and
imposed a similarly forceful directive: ""Counsel should make efforts to secure
information in the possession of the prosecution or law enforcement authorities,
including police reports."" Guideline 11.4.1.D.4.  When the United States argues
that Rompilla's defense counsel complied with these Guidelines, it focuses its
attentions on a different Guideline, 11.4.1.D.2.  Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 20-21.  Guideline 11.4.1.D.2 concerns practices for working with
the defendant and potential witnesses, and the United States contends that it
imposes no requirement to obtain any one particular type of record or
information.  Ibid. But this argument ignores the subsequent Guideline quoted
above, which is in fact reprinted in the appendix to the United States's brief,
that requires counsel to ""'make efforts to secure information in the possession
of the prosecution or law enforcement authorities.'"" App. to id., at 4a. Later,
and current, ABA Guidelines relating to death penalty defense are even more
explicit:  [HN9] ""Counsel must . . . investigate prior convictions . . . that
could be used as aggravating circumstances or otherwise come into evidence.  If
a prior conviction is legally flawed, counsel should seek to have it set aside.
Counsel may also find extenuating circumstances that can be offered to lessen
the weight of a conviction."" ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance
of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases 10.7, comment. (rev. ed. 2003),
reprinted in 31 Hofstra L. Rev. 913, 1027 (2003) (footnotes omitted). Our
decision in Wiggins made precisely the same point in citing the earlier 1989 ABA
Guidelines.  539 U.S., at 524, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471, 123 S. Ct. 2527 (""The ABA
Guidelines provide that  [HN10] investigations into mitigating evidence 'should
comprise efforts to discover all reasonably available mitigating evidence and
evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence that may be introduced by the
prosecutor'"" (quoting 1989 ABA Guideline 11.4.1.C; emphasis in original)).  For
reasons given in the text, no such further investigation was needed to point to
the reasonable duty to look in the file in question here.

 [*388]    [***LEdHR5A] [5A]  [***LEdHR6A] [6A] At argument the most that
Pennsylvania (and the United States as amicus) could [**2467]  say was that
defense counsel's efforts to find mitigating evidence by other means excused
them from looking at the prior conviction file.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 37-39, 45-46.
And that, of course, is the position taken by the state postconviction courts.
Without specifically discussing the prior case file, they too found that defense
counsel's  [*389]  efforts were enough to free them from any obligation to
enquire further.  Commonwealth v. Rompilla, No. 682/1988 (Pa. Ct. Common Pleas,
Aug. 23, 1996), App. 263-264, 272-273.

[***LEdHR5A] [5B]  [***LEdHR6A] [6B] We think this conclusion of the state court
fails to answer the considerations we have set out, to the point of being an
objectively unreasonable conclusion.  It flouts prudence to deny that a defense
lawyer should try to look at a file he knows the prosecution will cull for
aggravating evidence, let alone when the file is sitting in the trial
courthouse, open for the asking.  No reasonable lawyer would forgo examination
of the file thinking he could do as well by asking the defendant or family
relations whether they recalled anything helpful or damaging in the prior
victim's testimony.  Nor would a reasonable lawyer compare possible searches for
school reports, juvenile records, and evidence of drinking habits to the
opportunity to take a look at a file disclosing what the prosecutor knows and
even plans to read from in his case.  Questioning a few more family members and
searching for old records can promise less than looking for a needle in a
haystack, when a lawyer truly has  [***377]  reason to doubt there is any needle
there.  E.g.,  Strickland, supra, at 699, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 104 S. Ct. 2052.
But looking at a file the prosecution says it will use is a sure bet: whatever
may be in that file is going to tell defense counsel something about what the
prosecution can produce.

[***LEdHR6A] [6C] The dissent thinks this analysis creates a ""rigid, per se""
rule that requires defense counsel to do a complete review of the file on any
prior conviction introduced, post, at 404, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 386 (opinion of
Kennedy, J.), but that is a mistake.  Counsel fell short here because they
failed to make reasonable efforts to review the prior conviction file, despite
knowing that the prosecution intended to introduce Rompilla's prior conviction
not merely by entering a notice of conviction into evidence but by quoting
damaging testimony of the rape victim in that case.  The unreasonableness of
attempting no more than they did was heightened by the easy availability of the
file  [*390]  at the trial courthouse, and the great risk that testimony about a
similar violent crime would hamstring counsel's chosen defense of residual
doubt. It is owing to these circumstances that the state courts were objectively
unreasonable in concluding that counsel could reasonably decline to make any
effort to review the file.  Other situations, where a defense lawyer is not
charged with knowledge that the prosecutor intends to use a prior conviction in
this way, might well warrant a different assessme"

 [*15]  [**1257]   Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court, except as
to Part III.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A]  [***LEdHR2] [2] Title 18 U.S.C. § 924(e) (2000 ed. and Supp.
II) [18 USCS § 924(e)], popularly known as the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA),
mandates a minimum 15-year prison sentence for anyone possessing a firearm after
three prior convictions for serious drug offenses or violent felonies.  The Act
makes burglary a violent  [*16]  felony only if committed in a building or
enclosed space (""generic burglary""), not in a boat or motor vehicle.  In  Taylor
v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607, 110 S. Ct. 2143 (1990), we
held that  [HN1] a court sentencing under the ACCA could look to statutory
elements, charging documents, and jury instructions to determine whether an
earlier conviction after trial was for generic burglary. The question here is
whether a sentencing court can look to police reports or complaint applications
to determine whether an earlier guilty plea necessarily admitted, and supported
a conviction for, generic burglary. We hold that it may not, and that a later
court determining the character of an admitted burglary is generally limited to
examining the statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement,
transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge
to which the defendant assented.

I

Petitioner Reginald Shepard was indicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) [18 USCS §
922(g)(1)], barring felons from possessing a firearm, and pleaded guilty. At
sentencing the Government claimed that Shepard's prior convictions raised his
sentencing range from between 30 and 37 months (under the United States
[***212]  Sentencing Guidelines) to the 15-year minimum required by § 924(e),
pointing to four prior convictions entered upon Shepard's pleas of guilty under
one of Massachusetts's two burglary statutes. 1 Whereas the Government said that
each conviction represented a predicate ACCA offense of generic burglary, the
District Court ruled that Taylor barred counting any of the prior convictions as
predicates for the mandatory minimum.   125 F. Supp. 2d 562, 569 (Mass. 2000).

failing to obtain adequate documentation about this conviction the Government
focused on the other four.

  [***LEdHR3] [3] In Taylor we read the listing of ""burglary"" as a predicate
""violent felony"" (in the ACCA) to refer to what we called  [*17]  ""generic
burglary,"" an ""unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building
or structure, with intent to commit a crime.""  495 U.S., at 599, 109 L. Ed. 2d
607, 110 S. Ct. 2143.  Because statutes in some States (like Massachusetts)
define burglary more broadly, as by extending it to entries into boats and cars,
we had to consider how a later court sentencing under the ACCA might tell
whether a prior burglary conviction was for the generic offense. 2 We held
[**1258]  that the ACCA generally prohibits the later court from delving into
particular facts disclosed by the record of conviction, thus leaving the court
normally to ""look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of
the prior offense.""  Id., at 602, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607, 110 S. Ct. 2143.  We
recognized an exception to this ""categorical approach"" only for ""a narrow range
of cases where a jury [in a State with a broader definition of burglary] was
actually required to find all the elements of"" the generic offense.  Ibid. We
held the exception applicable ""if the indictment or information and jury
instructions show that the defendant was charged only with a burglary of a
building, and that the jury necessarily had to find an entry of a building to
convict . . . ."" Ibid. Only then might a conviction under a ""nongeneric""
burglary statute qualify as an ACCA predicate.

2 Although Taylor involved prior burglaries, as this case does, our holding in
Taylor covered other predicate ACCA offenses.   495 U.S., at 600, 109 L. Ed. 2d
607, 110 S. Ct. 2143.

In this case, the offenses charged in state complaints were broader than generic
burglary, and there were of course no jury instructions that might have narrowed
the charges to the generic limit.  The Government nonetheless urged the District
Court to examine reports submitted by the police with applications for issuance
of the complaints, as a way of telling whether Shepard's guilty pleas went to
generic burglaries notwithstanding the broader descriptions of the offenses in
the complaints, descriptions that tracked the more expansive definition in
Massachusetts law.  The court concluded that Taylor forbade this,  and that
investigation within the Taylor limits failed to show that Shepard had  [*18]
three generic burglary convictions.  The court accordingly refused to consider
the 15-year mandatory minimum, though it did sentence Shepard somewhat above the
standard level under the Sentencing Guidelines, on the ground that his criminal
history category under the Guidelines did not do justice to his ample criminal
record.

On appeal the First Circuit, following its earlier decision in  United  [***213]
States v. Harris, 964 F.2d 1234 (1992), vacated the sentence and ruled that
complaint applications and police reports may count as ""sufficiently reliable
evidence for determining whether a defendant's plea of guilty constitutes an
admission to a generically violent crime,""  231 F.3d 56, 67 (2000).  As to each
of Shepard's prior convictions, the court remanded the case for the District
Court to determine whether there was ""sufficiently reliable evidence that the
government and the defendant shared the belief that the defendant was pleading
guilty to a generically violent crime.""  Id., at 70.

The District Court again declined to impose the 15-year mandatory minimum,  even
though the Government supplemented its earlier submission with police reports or
complaint applications on two additional burglary convictions.  The District
Judge noted that the only account of what occurred at each of the prior plea
hearings came from an affidavit submitted by Shepard, who stated ""that none of
the details in th[e police] reports w[as] ever mentioned at his pleas,"" that
""the reports themselves were never read by the judge to him during the plea
colloquy,"" and that at no time ""was he ever asked if the information contained
in the . . . [r]eports w[as] true.""  181 F. Supp. 2d 14, 19 (Mass. 2002).
Shepard further swore that ""with respect to each report: [he] did not admit the
truth of the information contained in the . . . [r]eport as part of [his] plea
and [had] never admitted in court the facts alleged in the report . . . .""  Id.,
at 19-20 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Based on this, the District Court
found that the Government [**1259]  had failed to carry  [*19]  its burden to
demonstrate that Shepard had pleaded to three generic burglaries.

The Court of Appeals again vacated the sentence. After observing that Shepard
had never ""seriously disputed"" that he did in fact break into the buildings
described in the police reports or complaint applications,  348 F.3d 308, 311
(CA 1, 2003), the court rejected the District Court's conclusion that the
Government had not shown the requisite predicate offenses for the 15-year
minimum sentence,  id., at 314.  The case was remanded with instructions to
impose that sentence.

We granted certiorari, 542 U.S. 918, 159 L. Ed. 2d 775, 124 S. Ct. 2871 (2004),
to address divergent decisions in the Courts of Appeals applying Taylor when
prior convictions stem from guilty pleas, not jury verdicts.  We now reverse.

II

[***LEdHR4] [4] We agree with the First Circuit (and every other Court of
Appeals to speak on the matter) that  [HN2] guilty pleas may establish ACCA
predicate offenses and that Taylor's reasoning controls the identification of
generic convictions following pleas, as well as convictions on verdicts, in
States with nongeneric offenses.  See  348 F.3d at 312, n. 4 (citing cases).
Shepard wisely refrains from challenging this position, for the ACCA nowhere
provides that convictions in tried and pleaded cases are to be regarded
differently.  It drops no hint that Congress contemplated different standards
for establishing the fact of prior convictions, turning on the basis of trial or
plea.  Nothing to that effect is suggested, after all, by the language imposing
the categorical approach, which refers to predicate offenses in terms not of
prior conduct  [***214]  but of prior ""convictions"" and the ""element[s]"" of
crimes.   Taylor, Supra, at 600-601, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607, 110 S. Ct. 2143 (citing
18 U.S.C. § 924(e) [18 USCS § 924(e)]).  Nor does the ACCA's legislative history
reveal a lesser congressional preference for a categorical, as distinct from
fact-specific, approach to recognizing ACCA predicates in cases resolved by
plea.   Taylor, Supra, at 601, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607, 110 S. Ct. 2143.  And  [*20]
certainly, ""the practical difficulties and potential unfairness of a factual
approach are daunting,"" ibid., no less in pleaded than in litigated cases.
Finally, nothing in Taylor's rationale limits it to prior jury convictions; our
discussion of the practical difficulties inherent in looking into underlying
circumstances spoke specifically of ""cases where the defendant pleaded guilty,
[in which] there often is no record of the underlying facts."" Ibid. Our job,
then, is to find the right analogs for applying the Taylor rule to pleaded
cases.

The Taylor Court drew a pragmatic conclusion about the best way to identify
generic convictions in jury cases, while respecting Congress's adoption of a
categorical criterion that avoids subsequent evidentiary enquiries into the
factual basis for the earlier conviction.  The Court held that generic burglary
could be identified only by referring to charging documents filed in the court
of conviction, or to recorded judicial acts of that court limiting convictions
to the generic category, as in giving instruction to the jury.

The Court did not, however, purport to limit adequate judicial record evidence
strictly to charges and instructions,  id., at 602, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607, 110 S.
Ct. 2143 (discussing the use of these documents as an ""example""), since a
conviction might follow trial to a judge alone or a plea of guilty.  In cases
tried without a jury, the closest analogs to jury instructions would be a
bench-trial judge's formal rulings of law and findings of fact, and in pleaded
cases they would be the statement of factual basis for the charge, Fed. Rule
Crim. Proc. 11(a)(3), shown by a transcript of plea colloquy or by written
[**1260]  plea agreement presented to the court, or by a record of comparable
findings of fact adopted by the defendant upon entering the plea. 3 With  [*21]
such material in a pleaded case, a later court could generally tell whether the
plea had ""necessarily"" rested on the fact identifying the burglary as generic,
Taylor, supra, at 602, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607, 110 S. Ct. 2143, just as the details
of instructions could support that conclusion in the jury case, or the details
of a generically limited charging document would do in any sort of case.

3 Several Courts of Appeals have taken a similar view, approving the use of some
or all of these documents.   United States v. Bonat, 106 F.3d 1472, 1476-1477
(CA9 1997);  United States v. Maness, 23 F.3d 1006, 1009-1010 (CA6 1994);
United States v. Smith, 10 F.3d 724, 733-734 (CA10 1993) (per curiam)
(construing United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual § 4B1.2 (Nov.
1990)).

The Government argues for a wider evidentiary cast, however, going beyond
conclusive records made or used in adjudicating guilt and looking to documents
submitted to lower courts even prior to charges.  It argues for considering a
police report submitted to a local court as grounds for issuing a complaint
under a nongeneric statute; if that report alleges facts that would satisfy the
elements of a generic statute, the report  [***215]  should suffice to show that
a later plea and conviction were for a predicate offense under the ACCA.  There
would be no reason for concern about unavailable witnesses or stale memories,
the Government points out, and such limited enquiry would be consistent with
Taylor because ""[t]he underlying purpose [would be] the same as in examining the
charging paper and jury instructions (which the Court endorsed in Taylor): to
determine the nature of the offense of which petitioner was convicted, rather
than to determine what he actually did."" Brief for United States 22-23.  The
Government stresses three points.

First, it says that the more accommodating view of evidence competent to prove
that the plea was to a generic offense will yield reliable conclusions.
Although the records of Shepard's pleas with their notations that he
""[a]dmit[ted] suff[icient] facts"" do not necessarily show that he admitted
entering buildings or structures, as would be true under a generic burglary
statute or charge, the police reports suffice to show that the record of
admitting sufficient facts ""can only have plausibly rested on petitioner's entry
of a building."" Id., at 25.

Second, the Government pulls a little closer to Taylor's demand for certainty
when identifying a generic offense by  [*22]  emphasizing that the records of
the prior convictions used in this case are in each instance free from any
inconsistent, competing evidence on the pivotal issue of fact separating generic
from nongeneric burglary. ""[T]here is nothing in the record to indicate that
petitioner had pleaded guilty based on entering a ship or vehicle on any of the
occasions at issue."" Brief for United States 16.

Finally, the Government supports its call for a more inclusive standard of
competent evidence by invoking the virtue of a nationwide application of a
federal statute unaffected by idiosyncrasies of record keeping in any particular
State.  A bar on review of documents like police reports and complaint
applications would often make the ACCA sentencing enhancement ""hinge on the
happenstance of state court record-keeping practices and the vagaries of state
prosecutors' charging practices."" Brief in Opposition 13 (internal quotation
marks omitted).

On each point, however, the Government's position raises an uncomfortable
[**1261]  implication: every one of its arguments could have been pressed in
favor of an enquiry beyond what Taylor allows when a jury conviction follows
nongeneric instructions, and each is therefore as much a menace to Taylor as a
justification for an expansive approach to showing whether a guilty plea
admitted the generic crime.  If the transcript of a jury trial showed testimony
about a building break, one could say that the jury's verdict rested on a
finding to that effect.  If the trial record showed no evidence of felonious
entrance to anything but a building or structure, the odds that the offense
actually committed was generic burglary would be a turf accountant's dream.
And, again, if it were significant that vagaries of abbreviated plea records
could limit the application of the ACCA, the significance would be no less when
the disputed, predicate conviction followed a jury trial and the stenographic
notes of the charge had been thrown away.

[*23]  The Government's position thus  [***216]  amounts to a call to ease away
from the Taylor conclusion, that respect for congressional intent and avoidance
of collateral trials require that evidence of generic conviction be confined to
records of the convicting court approaching the certainty of the record of
conviction in a generic crime State.  But that limitation was the heart of the
decision, and we cannot have Taylor and the Government's position both.

[***LEdHR5] [5]  [***LEdHR6] [6]  [***LEdHR7A] [7A] There is not, however, any
sufficient justification for upsetting precedent here.  We are, after all,
dealing with an issue of statutory interpretation, see, e.g.,  Taylor, 495 U.S.,
at 602, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607, 110 S. Ct. 2143, and  [HN3] the claim to adhere to
case law is generally powerful once a decision has settled statutory meaning,
see  Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 172-173, 105 L. Ed. 2d 132,
109 S. Ct. 2363 (1989) (""Considerations of stare decisis have special force in
the area of statutory interpretation, for here, unlike in the context of
constitutional interpretation, the legislative power is implicated, and Congress
remains free to alter what we have done"").  In this instance, time has enhanced
even the usual precedential force, nearly 15 years having passed since Taylor
came down,  without any action by Congress to modify the statute as subject to
our understanding that it allowed only a restricted look beyond the record of
conviction under a nongeneric statute. 4

4  [***LEdHR7A] [7B] Like the Government, the dissent would allow district
courts to examine a wider range of documents than we approve today, and its
proposal is no more consistent with Taylor than the Government's.   [HN4] Taylor
is clear that any enquiry beyond statute and charging document must be narrowly
restricted to implement the object of the statute and avoid evidentiary
disputes.  In the case before it, the Court drew the line after allowing courts
to review documents showing ""that the jury necessarily had to find an entry of a
building to convict.""  495 U.S., at 602, 109 L. Ed. 607, 110 S. Ct. 2143; see
also ibid. (permitting a sentencing court to look beyond the state statute ""in a
narrow range of cases where a jury was actually required to find all the
elements of generic burglary"").  As we say in the text, there are certainly jury
trials with record documents like those at issue here, never introduced at trial
but ""uncontradicted,""  post, at 31, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 221 (opinion of O'Connor,
J.), and ""internally consistent,"" ibid., with the evidence that came in.  The
dissent would presumably permit examination of such documents, but Taylor
assuredly does not.

The only way to reconcile the dissent's approach with Taylor is to say that in
Taylor the prior convictions followed jury verdicts while in this case each
prior conviction grew out of a guilty plea. See  post, at 36, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at
224 (""Taylor itself set no rule for guilty pleas"").   [HN5] But Taylor has no
suggestion that its reasoning would not apply in plea cases, and its discussion
of the practical difficulties specifically referred to prior guilty pleas.  495
U.S., at 601, 109 L. Ed. 607, 110 S. Ct. 2143.  Moreover, as we have noted, see
supra, at 19, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 213, and as the dissent nowhere disputes, the
ACCA provides no support for such a distinction.  We decline to create a
distinction that Congress evidently had no desire to draw, that Taylor did not
envision, and that we would be hard pressed to explain.

 [**1262]  [*24]    III

Developments in the law since Taylor, and since the First Circuit's decision in
Harris, provide a further reason to adhere to the demanding requirement that any
sentence under the ACCA rest on a showing that a prior conviction ""necessarily""
involved (and a prior plea necessarily admitted) facts equating to generic
burglary. The Taylor Court, indeed, was prescient in its discussion of problems
that would follow from allowing a broader evidentiary enquiry. ""If the
sentencing court were to conclude, from its own review of the record, that the
defendant [who was convicted under a nongeneric  [***217]  burglary statute]
actually committed a generic burglary, could the defendant challenge this
conclusion as abridging his right to a jury trial?""  Taylor, supra, 495 U.S. at
601, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607, 110 S. Ct. 2143.  The Court thus anticipated the very
rule later imposed for the sake of preserving the Sixth Amendment right, that
any fact other than a prior conviction sufficient to raise the limit of the
possible federal sentence must be found by a jury, in the absence of any waiver
of rights by the defendant.   Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 243, n. 6,
143 L. Ed. 2d 311, 119 S. Ct. 1215 (1999); see also  Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530
U.S. 466, 490, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435, 120 S. Ct. 2348 (2000).

The Government dismisses the relevance of the Jones-Apprendi implementation of
the jury right here by describing  [*25]  the determination necessary to apply
the ACCA as ""involv[ing] only an assessment of what the state court itself
already has been 'required to find' in order to find the defendant guilty.""
Brief for United States 38 (quoting  Taylor, supra, at 602, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607,
110 S. Ct. 2143).  But it is not that simple.  The problem is that ""what the
state court . . . has been 'required to find'"" is debatable.  In a nongeneric
State, the fact necessary to show a generic crime is not established by the
record of conviction as it would be in a generic State when a judicial finding
of a disputed prior conviction is made on the authority of  Almendarez-Torres v.
United States, 523 U.S. 224, 140 L. Ed. 2d 350, 118 S. Ct. 1219 (1998).  The
state statute requires no finding of generic burglary, and without a charging
document that narrows the charge to generic limits, the only certainty of a
generic finding lies in jury instructions, or bench-trial findings and rulings,
or (in a pleaded case) in the defendant's own admissions or accepted findings of
fact confirming the factual basis for a valid plea.  In this particular pleaded
case, the record is silent on the generic element, there being no plea agreement
or recorded colloquy in which Shepard admitted the generic fact.

Instead, the sentencing judge considering the ACCA enhancement would (on the
Government's view) make a disputed finding of fact about what the defendant and
state judge must have understood as the factual basis of the prior plea, and the
dispute raises the concern underlying Jones and Apprendi: the Sixth and
Fourteenth Amendments guarantee a jury standing between a defendant and the
power of the State, and they guarantee a jury's finding of any disputed fact
essential to increase the ceiling of a potential sentence. While the disputed
fact here can be described as a fact about a prior conviction, it is too far
removed from the conclusive significance of a prior judicial record, and too
much like the findings subject to Jones and Apprendi, to say that
Almendarez-Torres clearly authorizes a judge to resolve the dispute.   [HN6] The
rule of reading [**1263]  statutes to avoid serious risks of
unconstitutionality, see  Jones, supra, at 239, 143 L. Ed. 2d 311, 119 S. Ct.
1215, therefore  [*26]  counsels us to limit the scope of judicial factfinding
on the disputed generic character of a prior plea, just as Taylor constrained
judicial findings about the generic implication of a jury's verdict. 5

5 The dissent charges that our decision may portend the extension of  Apprendi
v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435, 120 S. Ct. 2348 (2000), to proof
of prior convictions, a move which (if it should occur) ""surely will do no
favors for future defendants in Shepard's shoes.""  Post, at 38, 161 L. Ed. 2d,
at 225.  According to the dissent, the Government, bearing the burden of proving
the defendant's prior burglaries to the jury, would then have the right to
introduce evidence of those burglaries at trial, and so threaten severe
prejudice to the defendant.  It is up to the future to show whether the dissent
is good prophesy, but the dissent's apprehensiveness can be resolved right now,
for if the dissent turns out to be right that Apprendi will reach further, any
defendant who feels that the risk of prejudice is too high can waive the right
to have a jury decide questions about his prior convictions.

 [***218]   IV

[***LEdHR1A] [1B] We hold that  [HN7] enquiry under the ACCA to determine
whether a plea of guilty to burglary defined by a nongeneric statute necessarily
admitted elements of the generic offense is limited to the terms of the charging
document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge
and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the
defendant, or to some comparable judicial record of this information.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings.

It is so ordered.

defendant's] sentence beyond the sentence that could have  [*27]  lawfully been
imposed by reference to facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant.""
United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 317-318, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621, 125 S. Ct.
738 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting in part).  Yet that is what the Armed Career
Criminal Act,  18 U.S.C. § 924(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. II) [18 USCS § 924(e)],
permits in this case.  Petitioner Reginald Shepard pleaded guilty to being a
felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) [18 USCS
§ 922(g)(1)], which exposed him to a maximum sentence of 10 years under §
924(a)(2) and a Federal Sentencing Guidelines range of 30-to-37 months.
However, § 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp II) mandated a minimum 15-year sentence if
Shepard had three previous convictions for ""a violent felony or a serious drug
offense."" Shepard has never conceded that his prior state-court convictions
qualify as violent felonies or serious drug offenses under § 924(e).  Even so,
the Court of Appeals resolved this contested factual matter by ordering the
District Court to impose the enhancement on remand.

The constitutional infirmity of § 924(e)(1) as applied to Shepard makes today's
decision an unnecessary exercise.  Nevertheless, the plurality today refines the
rule of  Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607, 110 S. Ct.
2143 (1990), and further instructs district courts on the evidence they may
consider in determining whether prior state convictions are § 924(e) predicate
offenses.  Taylor and today's decision thus explain to lower courts how to
conduct factfinding that is, according to the logic of this Court's intervening
[**1264]  precedents, unconstitutional in  [***219]  this very case.  The need
for further refinement of Taylor endures because this Court has not yet
reconsidered  Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 140 L. Ed. 2d
350, 118 S. Ct. 1219 (1998), which draws an exception to the Apprendi line of
cases for judicial factfinding that concerns a defendant's prior convictions.
See  Apprendi, supra, at 487-490, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435, 120 S. Ct. 2348.

Almendarez-Torres, like Taylor, has been eroded by this Court's subsequent Sixth
Amendment jurisprudence, and a majority of the Court now recognizes that
Almendarez-Torres was wrongly decided.  See  523 U.S., at 248-249, 140 L. Ed. 2d
350, 118 S. Ct. 1219 [*28]  (Scalia, J., joined by Stevens, Souter, and
Ginsburg, JJ., dissenting);  Apprendi, supra, at 520-521, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435, 120
S. Ct. 2348 (Thomas, J., concurring).  The parties do not request it here, but
in an appropriate case, this Court should consider Almendarez-Torres' continuing
viability.  Innumerable criminal defendants have been unconstitutionally
sentenced under the flawed rule of Almendarez-Torres, despite the fundamental
""imperative that the Court maintain absolute fidelity to the protections of the
individual afforded by the notice, trial by jury, and beyond-a-reasonable-doubt
requirements.""  Harris v. United States, 536 U.S. 545, 581-582, 153 L. Ed. 2d
524, 122 S. Ct. 2406 (2002) (Thomas, J., dissenting).

In my view, broadening the evidence judges may consider when finding facts under
Taylor--by permitting sentencing courts to look beyond charging papers, jury
instructions, and plea agreements to an assortment of other documents such as
complaint applications and police reports--would not give rise to constitutional
doubt, as the plurality believes.  See  ante, at 24-26, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at
216-217.  It would give rise to constitutional error, no less than does the
limited factfinding that Taylor's rule permits.  For this reason, as well as
those set forth in Parts I, II, and IV of the Court's opinion, the Court
correctly declines to broaden the scope of the evidence judges may consider
under Taylor. But because the factfinding procedure the Court rejects gives rise
to constitutional error, not doubt, I cannot join Part III of the opinion.

"           JILL L. BROWN, WARDEN, Petitioner v. WILLIAM CHARLES PAYTON",544 U.S. 133,"

 [*135]  [**1435]   Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]  The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit, convening en banc, granted habeas relief to respondent William Payton.
It held that the jury instructions in the penalty phase of his trial for capital
murder did not permit consideration of all the mitigation evidence Payton
presented.  The error, the court determined, was that the general mitigation
instruction did not make it clear to the jury that it could consider evidence
concerning Payton's postcrime religious conversion and the prosecutor was
allowed  [*136]  to urge this erroneous interpretation.  We granted the petition
for certiorari,  541 U.S. 1062, 541 U.S. 1062, 158 L. Ed. 2d 962, 124 S. Ct.
2388 (2004), to decide whether the Ninth Circuit's decision was contrary to the
limits on federal habeas review imposed by 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).  We now reverse.

I

In 1980,  while spending the night at a boarding house, Payton raped another
boarder, Pamela Montgomery, and then used a butcher knife to stab her to death.
Payton proceeded to enter the bedroom of the house's patron, Patricia Pensinger,
and to stab her as she slept aside her 10-year-old son, Blaine.  When Blaine
resisted, Payton started to stab him as well.  Payton's knife blade bent, and he
went to the [**1436]  kitchen to retrieve another.  Upon the intervention of
other boarders, Payton dropped the second knife and fled.

Payton was arrested and tried for the first-degree murder and rape of Pamela
Montgomery and for the attempted murders of Patricia and Blaine Pensinger.
Payton presented no evidence in the guilt phase of the trial and was convicted
on all counts.  The trial proceeded to the penalty phase, where the prosecutor
introduced evidence of a prior incident when Payton stabbed a girlfriend; a
prior conviction for rape; a prior drug-related felony conviction; and evidence
of jailhouse conversations in which Payton admitted he had an ""urge to kill"" and
a ""severe problem with sex and women"" that caused him to view all women as
potential victims to ""stab . . . and rape.""   People v. Payton, 3 Cal. 4th 1050,
1058, 839 P.2d 1035, 1040, 13 Cal. Rptr. 2d 526 (1992) (internal quotation marks
omitted).

Defense counsel concentrated on Payton's postcrime behavior and presented
evidence from eight witnesses.  They testified that in the year and nine months
Payton spent in prison since his arrest, he had made a sincere commitment to
God, participated in prison Bible study classes and a prison ministry, and had a
calming effect on other prisoners.

[*137]  Before the penalty phase closing arguments, the judge held an
in-chambers conference with counsel to discuss jury instructions.  He proposed
to give--and later did give--an  [***342]  instruction which followed verbatim
the text of a California statute.  Cal. Penal Code Ann. § 190.3 (West 1988).
The instruction set forth 11 different factors, labeled (a) through (k), for the
jury to ""consider, take into account and be guided by"" in determining whether to
impose a sentence of life imprisonment or death.  1 Cal. Jury Instr., Crim., No.
8.84.1 (4th rev. ed. 1979).

The in-chambers conference considered in particular the last instruction in the
series, the so-called factor (k) instruction.  Factor (k) was a catchall
instruction, in contrast to the greater specificity of the instructions that
preceded it.  As set forth in the statute, and as explained to the jury, it
directed jurors to consider ""[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the
gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime."" Cal.
Penal Code Ann. § 190.3 (West 1988).  (The statute has since been amended.)

Defense counsel objected to the instruction and asked that it be modified to
direct the jury, in more specific terms, to consider evidence of the defendant's
character and background.  The prosecution, on the other hand, indicated that in
its view factor (k) was not intended to encompass evidence concerning a
defendant's background or character.  The court agreed with defense counsel that
factor (k) was a general instruction covering all mitigating evidence. It
declined, however, to modify the wording, in part because the instruction
repeated the text of the statute.  In addition, the court stated: ""I assume you
gentlemen, as I said, in your argument can certainly relate--relate back to
those factors and certainly can argue the defendant's character, background,
history, mental condition, physical condition; certainly fall into category 'k'
and certainly make a clear argument to the jury."" App. 59.

[*138]  The judge prefaced closing arguments by instructing the jury that what
it would hear from counsel was ""not evidence but argument"" and ""[you] should
rely on your own recollection of the evidence."" Id., at 62.  In his closing, the
prosecutor offered jurors his opinion that factor (k) did not allow them to
consider anything that happened ""after the [crime] or later."" Id., at 68.  The
parties do not now dispute [**1437]  that this was a misstatement of law.  The
defense objected to the comment and moved for a mistrial, which the trial court
denied.  The court admonished the jury that the prosecutor's comments were
merely argument, but it did not explicitly instruct the jury that the
prosecutor's interpretation was incorrect. Id., at 69-70.

Although the prosecutor again told the jury several times that, in his view, the
jury had not heard any evidence of mitigation, he proceeded to argue that the
circumstances and facts of the case, coupled with Payton's prior violent acts,
outweighed the mitigating effect of Payton's newfound Christianity.  Id., at 70
.  He discussed the mitigation evidence in considerable detail and concluded by
urging that the circumstances of the case and Payton's prior violent acts
outweighed his religious conversion. Id., at 75-76.  In his closing, defense
counsel argued to the jury that, although it might be awkwardly worded, factor
(k) was a catchall instruction designed to cover precisely the kind of evidence
Payton had presented.

The trial court's final instructions  [***343]  to the jury included the factor
(k) instruction, as well as an instruction directing the jury to consider all
evidence presented during the trial.  Id., at 94.  The jury found the special
circumstance of murder in the course of committing rape and returned a verdict
recommending a death sentence. The judge sentenced Payton to death for murder
and to 21 years and 8 months for rape and attempted murder.

On direct appeal to the California Supreme Court, Payton argued that his penalty
phase jury incorrectly was led to  [*139]  believe it could not consider the
mitigating evidence of his postconviction conduct in determining whether he
should receive a sentence of life imprisonment or death, in violation of the
Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution .   Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586,
602-609, 57 L. Ed. 2d 973, 98 S. Ct. 2954 (1978) (plurality opinion).  The text
of the factor (k) instruction, he maintained, was misleading, and rendered more
so in light of the prosecutor's argument.

In a 5-to-2 decision, the California Supreme Court rejected Payton's claims and
affirmed his convictions and sentence.  3 Cal. 4th 1050, 839 P. 2d 1035, 13 Cal.
Rptr. 2d 526 (1992).  Applying  Boyde v. California, 494 U.S. 370, 108 L. Ed. 2d
316, 110 S. Ct. 1190 (1990), which had considered the constitutionality of the
same factor (k) instruction, the state court held that in the context of the
proceedings there was no reasonable likelihood that Payton's jury believed it
was required to disregard his mitigating evidence.  3 Cal. 4th, at 1070-1071,
839 P. 2d, at 1048.  Payton sought review of the California Supreme Court's
decision here.  We declined to grant certiorari.   Payton v. California, 510
U.S. 1040, 126 L. Ed. 2d 649, 114 S. Ct. 682 (1994).

Payton filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States
District Court for the Central District of California, reiterating that the jury
was prevented from considering his mitigation evidence.  The District Court held
that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110
Stat. 1214, did not apply to Payton's petition because he had filed a motion for
appointment of counsel before AEDPA's effective date, even though he did not
file the petition until after that date.  The District Court considered his
claims de novo and granted the petition.

On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, a divided panel
reversed.   Payton v. Woodford, 258 F.3d 905 (2001).  The Court of Appeals
granted Payton's petition for rehearing en banc and, by a 6-to-5 vote, affirmed
the District [**1438]  Court's order granting habeas relief.   Payton v.
Woodford, 299 F.3d 815 (2002).  The en banc panel, like the District Court, held
that AEDPA did not govern Payton's petition.   [*140]  It, too, conducted a de
novo review of his claims, and concluded that postcrime mitigation evidence was
not encompassed by the factor (k) instruction, a view it found to have been
reinforced by the prosecutor's arguments.

The State petitioned for certiorari.  Pursuant to   Woodford v. Garceau, 538
U.S. 202, 155 L. Ed. 2d 363, 123 S. Ct. 1398 (2003), which held that a request
for appointment of counsel did not suffice to make ""pending"" a habeas petition
filed after AEDPA's effective date, we granted the State's petition,  Woodford
v. Payton, 538 U.S. 975, 155 L. Ed. 2d 662, 123 S. Ct. 1785 (2003)  [***344]  ,
and remanded to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration of its decision under
AEDPA's deferential standards.  See  Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 146 L.
Ed. 2d 389, 120 S. Ct. 1495 (2000).

On remand, the en banc panel affirmed the District Court's previous grant of
habeas relief by the same 6-to-5 vote.   Payton v. Woodford, 346 F.3d 1204 (CA9
2003).  In light of Garceau, the Court of Appeals purported to decide the case
under the deferential standard AEDPA mandates.  It concluded, however, that the
California Supreme Court had unreasonably applied this Court's precedents in
holding the factor (k) instruction was not unconstitutionally ambiguous in
Payton's case.

The Court of Appeals relied, as it had in its initial decision, on the
proposition that Boyde concerned precrime, not postcrime, mitigation evidence.
Boyde, in its view, reasoned that a jury would be unlikely to disregard
mitigating evidence as to character because of the long-held social belief that
defendants who commit criminal acts attributable to a disadvantaged background
may be less culpable than defendants who have no such excuse.  As to postcrime
mitigating evidence, however, the Court of Appeals concluded that ""there is
reason to doubt that a jury would similarly consider post-crime evidence of a
defendant's religious conversion and good behavior in prison.""  346 F.3d, at
1212.  It cited no precedent of this Court to support that supposition.

In addition, it reasoned that unlike in Boyde the prosecutor in Payton's case
misstated the law and the trial court did  [*141]  not give a specific
instruction rejecting that misstatement, relying instead on a general admonition
that counsel's arguments were not evidence.  These two differences, the Court of
Appeals concluded, made Payton's case unlike Boyde.  346 F.3d, at 1216.  In its
view, the factor (k) instruction was likely to have misled the jury and it was
an unreasonable application of this Court's cases for the California Supreme
Court to have concluded otherwise.

II

[***LEdHR3] [3]   [HN1] AEDPA provides that, when a habeas petitioner's claim
has been adjudicated on the merits in state-court proceedings, a federal court
may not grant relief unless the state court's adjudication of the claim
""resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable
application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme
Court of the United States."" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) [28 USCS § 2254(d)(1)].  A
state-court decision is contrary to this Court's clearly established precedents
if it applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in our cases,
or if it confronts a set of facts that is materially indistinguishable from a
decision of this Court but reaches a different result.   Williams v. Taylor,
supra, at 405, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389, 120 S. Ct. 1495;  Early v. Packer, 537 U.S. 3,
8, 154 L. Ed. 2d 263, 123 S. Ct. 362 (2002)  [**1439] (per curiam).  A
state-court decision involves an unreasonable application of this Court's
clearly established precedents if the state court applies this Court's
precedents to the facts in an objectively unreasonable manner.    Williams v.
Taylor, supra, at 405, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389, 120 S. Ct. 1495;  Woodford v.
Visciotti, 537 U.S. 19, 24-25, 154 L. Ed. 2d 279, 123 S. Ct. 357 (2002) (per
curiam). These  [***345]  conditions for the grant of federal habeas relief have
not been established.

A

The California Supreme Court was correct to identify Boyde as the starting point
for its analysis.  Boyde involved a challenge to the same instruction at issue
here, factor (k).  As to the text of factor (k), Boyde established that it does
[*142]  not limit the jury's consideration of extenuating circumstances solely
to circumstances of the crime.  See  494 U.S., at 382, 108 L. Ed. 2d 316, 110 S.
Ct. 1190.  In so holding, we expressly rejected the suggestion that factor (k)
precluded the jury from considering evidence pertaining to a defendant's
background and character because those circumstances did not concern the crime
itself.  Boyde instead found that factor (k), by its terms, directed the jury to
consider any other circumstance that might excuse the crime, including factors
related to a defendant's background and character.  We held:


     ""The [factor (k)] instruction did not, as petitioner seems to suggest,
     limit the jury's consideration to 'any other circumstance of the crime
     which extenuates the gravity of the crime.' The jury was directed to
     consider any other circumstance that might excuse the crime, which
     certainly includes a defendant's background and character."" Ibid.
     (emphasis in original).



The California Supreme Court read Boyde as establishing that the text of factor
(k) was broad enough to accommodate the postcrime mitigating evidence Payton
presented.   People v. Payton, 3 Cal. 4th, at 1070, 839 P. 2d, at 1048.  The
Court of Appeals held Boyde's reasoning did not control Payton's case because
Boyde concerned precrime, not postcrime, mitigation evidence.   346 F.3d, at
1211-1212.

[***LEdHR1A]  We do not think that, in light of Boyde, the California Supreme
Court acted unreasonably in declining to distinguish between precrime and
postcrime mitigating evidence. After all, Boyde held that factor (k) directed
consideration of any circumstance that might excuse the crime, and it is not
unreasonable to believe that a postcrime character transformation could do so.
Indeed, to accept the view that such evidence could not because it occurred
after the crime, one would have to reach the surprising conclusion that remorse
could never serve to lessen or excuse a crime.  But remorse, which by definition
can only be experienced after a crime's  [*143]  commission, is something
commonly thought to lessen or excuse a defendant's culpability.

B

That leaves respondent to defend the decision of the Court of Appeals on grounds
that, even if it was at least reasonable for the California Supreme Court to
conclude that the text of factor (k) allowed the jury to consider the postcrime
evidence, it was unreasonable to conclude that the prosecutor's argument and
remarks did not mislead the jury into believing it could not consider Payton's
mitigation evidence.  As we shall explain, however, the California Supreme
Court's conclusion that the jury was not reasonably likely to have accepted the
prosecutor's narrow view of factor (k) was an application of Boyde to similar
but not identical facts.  Even on the assumption that its conclusion was
incorrect, it was [**1440]  not unreasonable, and is therefore  [***346]  just
the type of decision that AEDPA shields on habeas review.

[***LEdHR4] [4] The following language from Boyde should be noted at the outset:



     ""We think the proper inquiry in such a case is whether there is a
     reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged
     instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of
     constitutionally relevant evidence.  . . .  Jurors do not sit in
     solitary isolation booths parsing instructions for subtle shades of
     meaning in the same way that lawyers might.  Differences among them in
     interpretation of instructions may be thrashed out in the deliberative
     process, with commonsense understanding of the instructions in the
     light of all that has taken place at the trial likely to prevail over
     technical hairsplitting.""  494 U.S., at 380-381, 108 L. Ed. 2d 316,
     110 S. Ct. 1190 (footnote omitted).



Unlike in Boyde the prosecutor here argued to jurors during his closing that
they should not consider Payton's mitigation evidence, evidence which concerned
postcrime as opposed  [*144]  to precrime conduct.  Because Boyde sets forth a
general framework for determining whether a challenged instruction precluded
jurors from considering a defendant's mitigation evidence, however, the
California Supreme Court was correct to structure its own analysis on the
premises that controlled Boyde. The Boyde analysis applies here, and, even if it
did not dictate a particular outcome in Payton's case, it refutes the conclusion
of the Court of Appeals that the California Supreme Court was unreasonable.

[***LEdHR2A]  The prosecutor's mistaken approach appears most prominently at
three different points in the penalty phase. First, in chambers and outside the
presence of the jury he argued to the judge that background and character
(whether of precrime or postcrime) was simply beyond the ambit of the
instruction.  Second, he told the jurors in his closing statement that factor
(k) did not allow them to consider what happened ""after the [crime] or later.""
App. 68.  Third, after defense counsel objected to his narrow view, he argued to
the jury that it had not heard any evidence of mitigation. Id., at 70. Boyde,
however, mandates that the whole context of the trial be considered.  And
considering the whole context of the trial, it was not unreasonable for the
state court to have concluded that this line of prosecutorial argument did not
put Payton's mitigating evidence beyond the jury's reach.

The prosecutor's argument came after the defense presented eight witnesses,
spanning two days of testimony without a single objection from the prosecution
as to its relevance. As the California Supreme Court recognized, like in Boyde,
for the jury to have believed it could not consider Payton's mitigating
evidence, it would have had to believe that the penalty phase served virtually
no purpose at all.  Payton's counsel recognized as much, arguing to the jury
that ""[t]he whole purpose for the second phase [of the] trial is to decide the
proper punishment to be imposed.  Everything that was presented by the defense
relates directly to  [*145]  that."" App. 88.  He told the jury that if the
evidence Payton presented was not entitled to consideration, and therefore ""all
the evidence we presented [would not be] applicable, why didn't we hear any
objections to its relevance?"" Ibid. The prosecutor  [***347]  was not given an
opportunity to rebut defense counsel's argument that factor (k) required the
jury to consider Payton's mitigating evidence.

For his part, the prosecutor devoted specific attention to disputing the
sincerity of Payton's evidence, stating that ""everybody [**1441]  seems to get
religion in jail when facing the death penalty"" and that ""[s]tate prison is full
of people who get religion when they are in jail."" Id., at 74.  Later, he
intimated the timing of Payton's religious conversion was suspect, stating ""he
becomes a newborn Christian, after he's in custody"" after ""he gets caught.""
Ibid. As the California Supreme Court reasonably surmised, this exercise would
have been pointless if the jury believed it could not consider the evidence.

Along similar lines, although the prosecutor characterized Payton's evidence as
not being evidence of mitigation, he devoted substantial attention to
discounting its importance as compared to the aggravating factors.  He said:


     ""The law in its simplicity is that the aggravating--if the aggravating
     factors outweigh the mitigating, the sentence the jury should vote for
     should be the death penalty. How do the factors line up?  The
     circumstances and facts of the case, the defendant's other acts
     showing violence . . ., the defendant's two prior convictions line up
     against really nothing except [the] defendant's newborn Christianity
     and the fact that he's 28 years old.  This is not close.  You haven't
     heard anything to mitigate what he's done.  If you wanted to
     distribute a thousand points over the factors, 900 would have to go to
     what he did to [the victim], and I really doubt if [defense counsel]
     would dispute that breakdown of the facts."" Id., at 76.



 [*146]  Indeed, the prosecutor characterized testimony concerning Payton's
religious conversion as ""evidence"" on at least four separate occasions.  Id., at
68, 70, 73.  In context, it was not unreasonable for the state court to conclude
that the jury believed Payton's evidence was neither credible nor sufficient to
outweigh the aggravating factors, not that it was not evidence at all.

To be sure, the prosecutor advocated a narrow interpretation of factor (k), an
interpretation that neither party accepts as correct.  There is, however, no
indication that the prosecutor's argument was made in bad faith, nor does Payton
suggest otherwise.  In addition, the first time the jury was exposed to the
prosecutor's narrow and incorrect view of factor (k), it had already heard the
entirety of Payton's mitigating evidence. Defense counsel immediately objected
to the prosecutor's narrow characterization, and the trial court, noting at a
side bar that one could ""argue it either way,"" admonished the jury that ""the
comments by both the prosecution and the defense are not evidence.  You've heard
the evidence and, as I said, this is argument.  And it's to be placed in its
proper perspective."" Id., at 69-70.

The trial judge, of course, should have advised the jury that it could consider
Payton's evidence under factor (k), and allowed counsel simply to argue the
evidence's persuasive force instead of the meaning of the instruction itself.
The judge is, after all, the one responsible for instructing the jury on the
law, a responsibility that may not be abdicated to  [***348]  counsel.  Even in
the face of the trial court's failure to give an instant curative instruction,
however, it was not unreasonable to find that the jurors did not likely believe
Payton's mitigation evidence beyond their reach.  The jury was not left without
any judicial direction.  Before it began deliberations as to what penalty was
appropriate, the court instructed it to consider all evidence received ""during
any part of the trial in this case, except as you may be hereafter instructed,""
id., at 94 , and it was not thereafter instructed  [*147]  to disregard
anything.  It was also instructed as to factor (k) which, as we held in Boyde,
by [**1442]  its terms directs jurors to consider any other circumstance that
might lessen a defendant's culpability.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]  Testimony about a religious conversion spanning one
year and nine months may well have been considered altogether insignificant in
light of the brutality of the crimes, the prior offenses, and a proclivity for
committing violent acts against women.  It was not unreasonable for the state
court to determine that the jury most likely believed that the evidence in
mitigation, while within the reach of the factor (k) instruction, was simply too
insubstantial to overcome the arguments for imposing the death penalty; nor was
it unreasonable for the state court to rely upon Boyde to support its analysis.
Even were we to assume the ""'relevant state-court decision applied clearly
established federal law erroneously or incorrectly,'""  Lockyer v. Andrade, 538
U.S. 63, 76, 155 L. Ed. 2d 144, 123 S. Ct. 1166 (2003) (quoting   Williams v.
Taylor, 529 U.S., at 411, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389, 120 S. Ct. 1495), there is no basis
for further concluding that the application of our precedents was ""objectively
unreasonable,""  Lockyer, supra, at 76, 155 L. Ed. 2d 144, 123 S. Ct. 1166.  The
Court of Appeals made this last mentioned assumption, and it was in error to do
so.  The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed.

It is so ordered.

The Chief Justice took no part in the decision of this case.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring.

I join the Court's opinion, which correctly holds that the California Supreme
Court's decision was not ""contrary to"" or ""an unreasonable application of"" our
cases.  28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) [28 USCS § 2254(d)(1)].  Even if our review were
not circumscribed by statute, I would adhere to my view that limiting a jury's
discretion to consider all mitigating evidence does not violate  [*148]  the
Eighth Amendment.  See   Walton v. Arizona, 497 U.S. 639, 673, 111 L. Ed. 2d
511, 110 S. Ct. 3047 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment).

Justice Breyer, concurring.

In my view, this is a case in which Congress' instruction to defer to the
reasonable conclusions of state-court judges makes a critical difference.  See
28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) [28 USCS § 2254(d)(1)].  Were I a California state judge,
I would likely hold that Payton's penalty-phase proceedings violated the Eighth
Amendment.  In a death case, the Constitution requires sentencing juries to
consider  [***349]  all mitigating evidence. See, e.g.,  Penry v. Lynaugh, 492
U.S. 302, 319, 106 L. Ed. 2d 256, 109 S. Ct. 2934 (1989).  And here, there might
well have been a ""reasonable likelihood"" that Payton's jury interpreted factor
(k), 1 Cal. Jury Instr., Crim., No. 8.84.1(k) (4th rev. ed. 1979), ""in a way
that prevent[ed]"" it from considering ""constitutionally relevant"" mitigating
evidence--namely, evidence of his postcrime religious conversion.   Boyde v.
California, 494 U.S. 370, 380, 108 L. Ed. 2d 316, 110 S. Ct. 1190 (1990).

Unlike Boyde, the prosecutor here told the jury repeatedly--and
incorrectly--that factor (k) did not permit it to take account of Payton's
postcrime religious conversion. See  post, at 154-155, 159-160, 161 L. Ed. 2d,
at 352-354, 355-356 (Souter, J., dissenting).  Moreover, the trial judge--also
incorrectly--did nothing to correct the record, likely leaving the jury with the
impression that it could not do that which the Constitution says it must. See
ante, at 146, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 347 (majority opinion);  post, at 159-160, 161
L. Ed. 2d, at 356.  Finally, factor (k) is ambiguous as to whether it
encompassed Payton's mitigation case.  Factor (k)'s text focuses on evidence
that reduces a defendant's moral culpability for committing the offense.  And
evidence of postcrime conversion is less obviously related to moral culpability
[**1443]  than is evidence of precrime background and character.  See  Boyde,
supra, at 382, n. 5, 108 L. Ed. 2d 316, 110 S. Ct. 1190 (suggesting a
distinction between precrime and postcrime evidence).  For all these reasons,
one could conclude that the jury here might have thought factor (k) barred
[*149]  its consideration of mitigating evidence, even if the jury in Boyde
would not there have reached a similar conclusion.

Nonetheless, in circumstances like the present, a federal judge must leave in
place a state-court decision unless the federal judge believes that it is
""contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established
Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States."" §
2254(d)(1).  For the reasons that the Court discusses, I cannot say that the
California Supreme Court decision fails this deferential test.  I therefore join
the Court's opinion.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

From a time long before William Payton's trial, it has been clear law under the
Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments that a sentencing jury in a capital case must
be able to consider and give effect to all relevant mitigating evidence a
defendant offers for a sentence less than death.  The prosecutor in Payton's
case effectively negated this principle in arguing repeatedly to the jury that
the law required it to disregard Payton's mitigating evidence of postcrime
religious conversion and rehabilitation.  The trial judge utterly failed to
correct these repeated misstatements or in any other way to honor his duty to
give the jury an accurate definition of legitimate mitigation. It was reasonably
likely in these circumstances that the jury failed to consider Payton's
mitigating evidence, and in concluding otherwise, the Supreme Court of
California unreasonably applied settled law, with substantially injurious
effect.   [***350]  The Court of Appeals wa"

 [*465]  [***805]  [**1891]    Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the
Court.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]  These consolidated cases present challenges to
state laws regulating the sale of wine from out-of-state wineries to consumers
in Michigan and New York.  The details and mechanics  [*466]  of the two
regulatory schemes differ, but the object and effect of the laws are the same:
to allow in-state wineries to sell wine directly to  [**1892] consumers in that
State but to prohibit out-of-state wineries from doing so, or, at the least, to
make direct sales impractical from an economic standpoint.  It is evident that
the object and design of the Michigan and New York statutes is to grant in-state
wineries a competitive advantage over wineries located beyond the States'
borders.

We hold that the laws in both States discriminate against interstate commerce in
violation of the Commerce Clause, Art. I, § 8, cl. 3, and that the
discrimination is neither authorized nor permitted by the Twenty-first Amendment
.  Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit, which invalidated the Michigan laws; and we reverse the judgment of the
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which upheld the New York laws.

I

Like many other States, Michigan and New York regulate the sale and importation
of alcoholic beverages, including wine, through a three-tier distribution
system.  Separate licenses are required for producers, wholesalers, and
retailers. See FTC, Possible Anticompetitive Barriers to E-Commerce: Wine 5-7
(July 2003) (hereinafter FTC Report), available at
http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/07/winereport2.pdf (all Internet materials as visited
May 11, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).  The three-tier
scheme is preserved by a complex set of overlapping state and federal
regulations. For example, both state and federal laws limit vertical integration
between tiers.  Id., at 5; 27 USC § 205 [27 USCS § 205]; see, e.g.,  Bainbridge
v. Turner, 311 F.3d 1104, 1106 (CA11 2002).  We have held previously that States
can mandate a three-tier distribution scheme in the exercise of their authority
under the Twenty-first Amendment.   North Dakota v. United States, 495 U.S. 423,
432, 109 L. Ed. 2d 420, 110 S. Ct. 1986 (1990);  id., at 447, 109 L. Ed. 2d 420,
110 S. Ct. 1986 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  As relevant to today's
cases, though,  [*467]  the three-tier system is, in broad terms and with
refinements to be discussed, mandated by Michigan and New York only for sales
from out-of-state wineries. In-state wineries, by contrast, can obtain a license
for direct sales to consumers. The differential treatment between in-state and
out-of-state wineries constitutes explicit discrimination against interstate
commerce.

This discrimination substantially limits the direct sale of wine to consumers,
an otherwise emerging and  [***806]  significant business.  FTC Report 7.  From
1994 to 1999, consumer spending on direct wine shipments doubled, reaching $500
million per year, or three percent of all wine sales.  Id., at 5.  The expansion
has been influenced by several related trends.  First, the number of small
wineries in the United States has significantly increased.  By some estimates
there are over 3,000 wineries in the country, WineAmerica, The National
Association of American Wineries, Wine Facts 2004,
http://www.americanwineries.org/newsroom/winefacts04.htm, more than three times
the number 30 years ago, FTC Report 6.  At the same time, the wholesale market
has consolidated.  Between 1984 and 2002, the number of licensed wholesalers
dropped from 1,600 to 600.  Riekhof & Sykuta, Regulating Wine by Mail, 27
Regulation, No. 3, pp. 30, 31 (Fall 2004), available at
http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv27n3/v27n3-3.pdf.  The increasing
winery-to-wholesaler ratio means that many small wineries do not produce enough
wine or have sufficient consumer demand for their wine to make it economical for
wholesalers to carry their products.  FTC Report 6.  This has led many small
wineries to rely on direct shipping to reach new markets.  [**1893]
Technological improvements,  in particular the ability of wineries to sell wine
over the Internet, have helped make direct shipments an attractive sales
channel.

Approximately 26 States allow some direct shipping of wine, with various
restrictions.  Thirteen of these States have reciprocity laws, which allow
direct shipment from wineries  [*468]  outside the State, provided the State of
origin affords similar nondiscriminatory treatment.  Id., at 7-8.  In many parts
of the country, however, state laws that prohibit or severely restrict direct
shipments deprive consumers of access to the direct market.  According to the
Federal Trade Commission (FTC), ""[s]tate bans on interstate direct shipping
represent the single largest regulatory barrier to expanded e-commerce in wine.""
Id., at 3.

The wine producers in the cases before us are small wineries that rely on direct
consumer sales as an important part of their businesses.  Domaine Alfred, one of
the plaintiffs in the Michigan suit, is a small winery located in San Luis
Obispo, California.  It produces 3,000 cases of wine per year.  Domaine Alfred
has received requests for its wine from Michigan consumers but cannot fill the
orders because of the State's direct-shipment ban.  Even if the winery could
find a Michigan wholesaler to distribute its wine, the wholesaler's markup would
render shipment through the three-tier system economically infeasible.

Similarly, Juanita Swedenburg and David Lucas, two of the plaintiffs in the New
York suit, operate small wineries in Virginia (the Swedenburg Estate Vineyard)
and California (the Lucas Winery).  Some of their customers are tourists, from
other States, who purchase wine while visiting the wineries. If these customers
wish to obtain Swedenburg or Lucas wines after they return home, they will be
unable to do so if they reside in a State with restrictive direct-shipment laws.
For example, Swedenburg and Lucas are unable to fill orders from New York, the
Nation's second-largest wine market, because of the limits that  [***807]  State
imposes on direct wine shipments.

A

We first address the background of the suit challenging the Michigan
direct-shipment law.  Most alcoholic beverages in Michigan are distributed
through the State's three-tier  [*469]  system.  Producers or distillers of
alcoholic beverages, whether located in state or out of state, generally may
sell only to licensed in-state wholesalers. Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §§ 436.1109(1)
, 436.1305, 436.1403, 436.1607(1) (West 2000); Mich. Admin. Code Rules 436.1705
(1990), 436.1719 (2000).  Wholesalers, in turn, may sell only to in-state
retailers. Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §§ 436.1113(7), 436.1607(1) (West 2001).
Licensed retailers are the final link in the chain, selling alcoholic beverages
to consumers at retail locations and, subject to certain restrictions, through
home delivery.  §§ 436.1111(5), 436.1203(2)-(4).

Under Michigan law, wine producers, as a general matter, must distribute their
wine through wholesalers. There is, however, an exception for Michigan's
approximately 40 in-state wineries, which are eligible for ""wine maker"" licenses
that allow direct shipment to in-state consumers. § 436.1113(9) (West 2001); §§
436.1537(2)-(3) (West Supp. 2004); Mich. Admin. Code Rule 436.1011(7)(b) (2003).
The cost of the license varies with the size of the winery. For a small winery,
the license is $25.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 436.1525(1)(d) (West Supp. 2004).
Out-of-state wineries can apply for a $300 ""outside seller of wine"" license, but
this license only allows them to sell to in-state wholesalers.  [**1894]  §§
436.1109(9) (West 2001), 436.1525(1)(e) (West Supp. 2004); Mich.  Admin. Code
Rule 436.1719(5) (2000).

Some Michigan residents brought suit against various state officials in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.  Domaine
Alfred, the San Luis Obispo winery, joined in the suit.  The plaintiffs
contended that Michigan's direct-shipment laws discriminated against interstate
commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause.  The trade association Michigan
Beer & Wine Wholesalers intervened as a defendant.  Both the State and the
wholesalers argued that the ban on direct shipment from out-of-state wineries is
a valid exercise of Michigan's power under § 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment.

[*470]  On cross-motions for summary judgment the District Court sustained the
Michigan scheme.  The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed.   Heald
v. Engler, 342 F.3d 517 (2003).  Relying on  Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468
U.S. 263, 82 L. Ed. 2d 200, 104 S. Ct. 3049 (1984), the court rejected the
argument that the Twenty-first Amendment immunizes all state liquor laws from
the strictures of the Commerce Clause,  342 F.3d, at 524, and held the Michigan
scheme was unconstitutional because the defendants failed to demonstrate the
State could not meet its proffered policy objectives through nondiscriminatory
means,  id., at 527.

B

New York's licensing scheme is somewhat different.  It channels most wine sales
through the three-tier system, but it too makes exceptions for in-state
wineries. As in Michigan, the result is to allow local wineries to make direct
sales to consumers in  [***808]  New York on terms not available to out-of-state
wineries. Wineries that produce wine only from New York grapes can apply for a
license that allows direct shipment to in-state consumers. N. Y. Alco. Bev.
Cont. Law Ann. § 76-a(3) (West Supp. 2005) (hereinafter N. Y. ABC Law).  These
licensees are authorized to deliver the wines of other wineries as well, §
76-a(6)(a), but only if the wine is made from grapes ""at least seventy-five
percent the volume of which were grown in New York state,"" § 3(20-a).  An
out-of-state winery may ship directly to New York consumers only if it becomes a
licensed New York winery, which requires the establishment of ""a branch factory,
office or storeroom within the state of New York."" § 3(37).

Juanita Swedenburg and David Lucas, joined by three of their New York customers,
brought suit in the Southern District of New York against the officials
responsible for administering New York's Alcoholic Beverage Control Law seeking,
inter alia, a declaration that the State's limitations on the direct shipment of
out-of-state wine violate the Commerce Clause.  New York liquor wholesalers and
representatives  [*471]  of New York liquor retailers intervened in support of
the State.

The District Court granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs.   232 F. Supp. 2d
135 (2002).  The court first determined that, under established Commerce Clause
principles, the New York direct-shipment scheme discriminates against
out-of-state wineries.  Id., at 146-147.  The court then rejected the State's
Twenty-first Amendment argument, finding that the ""[d]efendants have not shown
that New York's ban on the direct shipment of out-of-state wine, and
particularly the in-state exceptions to the ban, implicate the State's core
concerns under the Twenty-first Amendment.""  Id., at 148.

The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed.   358 F.3d 223 (2004).
The court ""recognize[d] that the physical presence requirement could create
substantial dormant  Commerce Clause problems [**1895]  if this licensing scheme
regulated a commodity other than alcohol.""  Id., at 238.  The court nevertheless
sustained the New York statutory scheme because, in the court's view, ""New
York's desire to ensure accountability through presence is aimed at the
regulatory interests directly tied to the importation and transportation of
alcohol for use in New York,"" ibid. As such, the New York direct shipment laws
were ""within the ambit of the powers granted to states by the Twenty-first
Amendment.""  Id., at 239.

C

We consolidated these cases and granted certiorari on the following question:
""'Does a State's regulatory scheme that permits in-state wineries directly to
ship alcohol to consumers but restricts the ability of out-of-state wineries to
do so violate the dormant Commerce Clause in light of § 2 of the Twenty-first
Amendment?'""  541 U.S. 1062, 158 L. Ed. 2d 962, 124 S. Ct. 2389 (2004).

For ease of exposition, we refer to the respondents from the Michigan challenge
(Nos. 03-1116 and 03-1120) and the petitioners in the New York challenge (No.
03-1274) collectively  [*472]  as the wineries. We refer to their opposing
parties--Michigan, New York, and the wholesalers and retailers--simply as the
States.

[***LEdHR3A]  Time and again this Court has held that,  [HN1] in all but the
narrowest circumstances, state laws violate the Commerce Clause if they mandate
""differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that
benefits the former and burdens the latter.""  Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v.
Department of Environmental Quality of Ore., 511 U.S. 93, 99, 128 L. Ed. 2d 13,
114 S. Ct. 1345 (1994).  See also  New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U.S.
269, 274, 100 L. Ed. 2d 302, 108 S. Ct. 1803 (1988).  This rule is essential to
the foundations of the Union.  The mere fact of nonresidence should not
foreclose a producer in one State from access to markets in other States.   H.
P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U.S. 525, 539, 93 L. Ed. 865, 69 S. Ct. 657
(1949).  States may not enact laws that burden out-of-state producers or
shippers simply to give a competitive advantage to in-state businesses.  This
mandate ""reflect[s] a central concern of the Framers that was an immediate
reason for calling the Constitutional Convention: the conviction that in order
to succeed, the new Union would have to avoid the tendencies toward economic
Balkanization that had plagued relations among the Colonies and later among the
States under the Articles of Confederation.""  Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U.S. 322,
325-326, 60 L. Ed. 2d 250, 99 S. Ct. 1727 (1979).

[***LEdHR4] [4] The rule prohibiting state discrimination against interstate
commerce follows also from the principle that States should not be compelled to
negotiate with each other regarding favored or disfavored status for their own
citizens.  States do not need, and may not attempt, to negotiate with other
States regarding their mutual economic interests.  Cf. U.S. Const., Art. I, §
10, cl. 3.  Rivalries among the States are thus kept to a minimum, and a
proliferation of trade zones is prevented.  See  C & A Carbone, Inc. v.
Clarkstown, [*473]  511 U.S. 383, 390, 128 L. Ed. 2d 399, 114 S. Ct. 1677 (1994)
(citing The Federalist No. 22, pp. 143-145 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton);
Madison, Vices of the Political System of the United States, in 2 Writings of
James Madison 362-363 (G. Hunt ed. 1901)).

[***LEdHR1A]   [**1896]  Laws of the type at issue in the instant cases
contradict these principles.  They deprive citizens of their right to have
access to the markets of other States on equal terms.  The perceived necessity
for reciprocal sale privileges risks generating the trade rivalries and
animosities, the alliances and exclusivity, that the Constitution and, in
particular, the Commerce Clause were designed to avoid.  State laws that protect
local wineries have led to the enactment of statutes under which some States
condition the right of out-of-state wineries to make direct wine sales to
in-state consumers on a reciprocal right in the shipping State.  California, for
example, passed a reciprocity law in 1986, retreating from the State's previous
regime that allowed unfettered direct shipments from out-of-state wineries.
Riekhof & Sykuta, 27 Regulation, No. 3, at 30.  Prior to 1986, all but three
States prohibited direct shipments of wine. The obvious aim of the California
statute was to open the interstate direct-shipping market for the State's many
wineries. Ibid. The current patchwork of laws--with some States banning direct
shipments altogether, others doing so only for  [***810]  out-of-state wines,
and still others requiring reciprocity--is essentially the product of an
ongoing, low-level trade war.  Allowing States to discriminate against
out-of-state wine ""invite[s] a multiplication of preferential trade areas
destructive of the very purpose of the Commerce Clause.""  Dean Milk Co. v.
Madison, 340 U.S. 349, 356, 95 L. Ed. 329, 71 S. Ct. 295 (1951). See also
Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U.S. 511, 521-523, 79 L. Ed. 1032, 55 S.
Ct. 497 (1935).

The discriminatory character of the Michigan system is obvious.  Michigan allows
in-state wineries to ship directly to consumers, subject only to a licensing
requirement.  Out-of-state  [*474]  wineries, whether licensed or not, face a
complete ban on direct shipment. The differential treatment requires all
out-of-state wine, but not all in-state wine, to pass through an in-state
wholesaler and retailer before reaching consumers. These two extra layers of
overhead increase the cost of out-of-state wines to Michigan consumers. The cost
differential, and in some cases the inability to secure a wholesaler for small
shipments, can effectively bar small wineries from the Michigan market.

The New York regulatory scheme differs from Michigan's in that it does not ban
direct shipments altogether.  Out-of-state wineries are instead required to
establish a distribution operation in New York in order to gain the privilege of
direct shipment. N. Y. ABC Law §§ 3(37), 96 (West Supp. 2005)..  This, though,
is just an indirect way of subjecting out-of-state wineries, but not local ones,
to the three-tier system.  New York and those allied with its interests defend
the scheme by arguing that an out-of-state winery has the same access to the
State's consumers as in-state wineries: All wine must be sold through a licensee
fully accountable to New York; it just so happens that in order to become a
licensee, a winery must have a physical presence in the State.  There is some
confusion over the precise steps out-of-state wineries must take to gain access
to the New York market, in part because no winery has run the State's regulatory
gauntlet.  New York's argument, in any event, is unconvincing.

[***LEdHR5] [5] The New York scheme grants in-state wineries access to the
State's consumers on preferential terms.  The suggestion of a limited exception
for direct shipment from out-of-state wineries does nothing to eliminate the
discriminatory nature of New York's regulations. In-state producers, with the
applicable licenses, can [**1897]  ship directly to consumers from their
wineries. §§ 76-a(3), 76(4), and 77(2)(West 2000) (West 2000).  Out-of-state
wineries must open a branch office and warehouse in New York, additional steps
that drive up the cost  [*475]  of their wine. §§ 3(37), 96 (West Supp. 2005).
See also App. in No. 03-1274, pp. 159-160 (Affidavit of Thomas G. McKeon,
General Counsel to the New York State Liquor Authority).  For most wineries, the
expense of establishing a bricks-and-mortar distribution operation in 1 State,
let alone all 50, is prohibitive.  It comes as no surprise that not a single
out-of-state winery has availed itself of New York's direct-shipping privilege.
We have ""viewed with particular suspicion state statutes requiring business
operations to be performed in the home State that could more efficiently be
performed  [***811]  elsewhere.""  Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137, 145,
25 L. Ed. 2d 174, 90 S. Ct. 844 (1970).  New York's in-state presence
requirement runs contrary to our admonition that  [HN2] States cannot require an
out-of-state firm ""to become a resident in order to compete on equal terms.""
Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. v. Reily, 373 U.S. 64, 72, 10 L. Ed. 2d 202,
83 S. Ct. 1201 (1963).  See also  Ward v. Maryland, 79 U.S. 418, 12 Wall. 418,
20 L. Ed. 449 (1871).

[***LEdHR1A]  In addition to its restrictive in-state presence requirement, New
York discriminates against out-of-state wineries in other ways.  Out-of-state
wineries that establish the requisite branch office and warehouse in New York
are still ineligible for a ""farm winery"" license, the license that provides the
most direct means of shipping to New York consumers. N. Y. ABC Law § 76-a(5)
(West Supp. 2005) (""No licensed farm winery shall manufacture or sell any wine
not produced exclusively from grapes or other fruits or agricultural products
grown or produced in New York state"").  Out-of-state wineries may apply only for
a commercial winery license. See §§ 3(37), 76.  Unlike farm wineries, however,
commercial wineries must obtain a separate certificate from the state liquor
authority authorizing direct shipments to consumers, § 77(2) (West 2000); and,
of course, for out-of-state wineries there is the additional requirement of
maintaining a distribution operation in New York.  New York law also allows
in-state wineries without direct-shipping licenses to distribute their wine
through other wineries that have the  [*476]  applicable licenses. § 76(5) (West
Supp 2005).  This is another privilege not afforded out-of-state wineries.

We have no difficulty concluding that New York, like Michigan, discriminates
against interstate commerce through its direct-shipping laws.

III

[HN3]  [***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR3A]  State laws that discriminate against
interstate commerce face ""a virtually per se rule of invalidity.""  Philadelphia
v. New Jersey, 437 U.S. 617, 624, 57 L. Ed. 2d 475, 98 S. Ct. 2531 (1978).  The
Michigan and New York laws by their own terms violate this proscription.  The
two States, however, contend their statutes are saved by § 2 of the Twenty-first
Amendment, which provides:


      [HN4] ""The transportation or importation into any State, Territory,
     or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of
     intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby
     prohibited.""



The States' position is inconsistent with our precedents and with the
Twenty-first Amendment's history.   [HN5] Section 2 does not allow States to
regulate the direct shipment of wine on terms that discriminate in favor of
in-state producers.

A

Before 1919, the temperance movement fought to curb the sale of alcoholic
beverages [**1898]  one State at a time.  The movement made progress, and many
States passed laws restricting or prohibiting the sale of alcohol. This Court
upheld state laws banning the production and sale of alcoholic beverages,
Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623, 31 L. Ed. 205, 8 S. Ct. 273 (1887), but was less
solicitous of laws aimed at imports. In a series of cases before ratification of
the Eighteenth Amendment the Court, relying on  [***812]  the Commerce Clause,
invalidated a number of state liquor regulations.

These cases advanced two distinct principles.  First, the Court held that the
Commerce Clause prevented States from discriminating against imported liquor.
Scott v. Donald, [*477]  165 U.S. 58, 41 L. Ed. 632, 17 S. Ct. 265 (1897);
Walling v. Michigan, 116 U.S. 446, 29 L. Ed. 691, 6 S. Ct. 454 (1886);  Tiernan
v. Rinker, 102 U.S. 123, 26 L. Ed. 103 (1880).  In Walling, for example, the
Court invalidated a Michigan tax that discriminated against liquor imports by
exempting sales of local products.  The Court held that States were not free to
pass laws burdening only out-of-state products:


     ""A discriminating tax imposed by a State operating to the disadvantage
     of the products of other States when introduced into the first
     mentioned State, is, in effect, a regulation in restraint of commerce
     among the States, and as such is a usurpation of the power conferred
     by the Constitution upon the Congress of the United States.""  116
     U.S., at 455, 29 L. Ed. 691, 6 S. Ct. 454.



Second, the Court held that the Commerce Clause prevented States from passing
facially neutral laws that placed an impermissible burden on interstate
commerce.  Rhodes v. Iowa, 170 U.S. 412, 42 L. Ed. 1088, 18 S. Ct. 664 (1898);
Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Co., 170 U.S. 438, 42 L. Ed. 1100, 18 S. Ct. 674
(1898);  Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U.S. 100, 34 L. Ed. 128, 10 S. Ct. 681, 12 Ky. L.
Rptr. 123 (1890);  Bowman v. Chicago & Northwestern R. Co., 125 U.S. 465, 31 L.
Ed. 700, 8 S. Ct. 689 (1888).  For example, in Bowman, the Court struck down an
Iowa statute that required all liquor importers to have a permit.  Bowman and
its progeny rested in part on the since-rejected original-package doctrine.
Under this doctrine goods shipped in interstate commerce were immune from state
regulation while in their original package.  As the Court explained in Vance:


     ""The power to ship merchandise from one State into another carries
     with it, as an incident, the right in the receiver of the goods to
     sell them in the original packages, any state regulation to the
     contrary notwithstanding; that is to say, that the goods received by
     Interstate Commerce remain under the shelter of the Interstate
     Commerce clause of the Constitution, until by a sale in the original
     package they have been commingled with  [*478]  the general mass of
     property in the State.""  170 U.S., at 444-445, 42 L. Ed. 1100, 18 S.
     Ct. 674.



Bowman reserved the question whether a State could ban the sale of imported
liquor altogether.   125 U.S., at 499-500, 31 L. Ed. 700, 8 S. Ct. 689.  Iowa
responded to Bowman by doing just that but was thwarted once again.  In  Leisy,
supra, the Court held that Iowa could not ban the sale of imported liquor in its
original package.

Leisy left the States in a bind.  They could ban the production of domestic
liquor,  Mugler, supra, but these laws were ineffective because out-of-state
liquor was immune from any state regulation as long as it remained in its
original package,  Leisy, supra. To resolve the matter, Congress passed the
Wilson Act (so named for Senator Wilson of Iowa), which empowered [**1899]  the
States to regulate  [***813]  imported liquor on the same terms as domestic
liquor:


     ""That all fermented, distilled, or other intoxicating liquors or
     liquids transported into any State or Territory or remaining therein
     for use, consumption, sale or storage therein, shall upon arrival in
     such State or Territory be subject to the operation and effect of the
     laws of such State or Territory enacted in the exercise of its police
     powers, to the same extent and in the same manner as though such
     liquids or liquors had been produced in such State or Territory, and
     shall not be exempt therefrom by reason of being introduced therein in
     original packages or otherwise."" Ch 728, 26 Stat 313 (codified at 27
     USC § 121 [27 USCS § 121]).



By its own terms, the Wilson Act did not allow States to discriminate against
out-of-state liquor; rather, it allowed States to regulate imported liquor only
""to the same extent and in the same manner"" as domestic liquor.

The Court confirmed this interpretation in  Scott, supra. Scott involved a
constitutional challenge to South Carolina's dispensary law, 1895 SC Acts p.
721, which required that  [*479]  all liquor sales be channeled through the
state liquor commissioner.   165 U.S., at 92, 41 L. Ed. 632, 17 S. Ct. 265.  The
statute discriminated against out-of-state manufacturers in two primary ways.
First, § 15 required the commissioner to ""purchase his supplies from the brewers
and distillers in this State when their product reaches the standard required by
this Act: Provided, Such supplies can be purchased as cheaply from such brewers
and distillers in this State as elsewhere."" 1895 SC Acts p. 732.  Second, § 23
of the statute limited the State's markup on locally produced wines to a
10-percent profit but provided ""no such limitation of charge in the case of
imported wines.""  165 U.S., at 93, 41 L. Ed. 632, 17 S. Ct. 265.  Based on these
discriminatory provisions, the Court rejected the argument that the South
Carolina dispensary law was authorized by the Wilson Act.  Id., at 100, 41 L.
Ed. 632, 17 S. Ct. 265.  It explained that the Wilson Act was ""not intended to
confer upon any State the power to discriminate injuriously against the products
of other States in articles whose manufacture and use are not forbidden, and
which are therefore the subjects of legitimate commerce."" Ibid. To the contrary,
the Court said, the Wilson Act mandated ""equality or uniformity of treatment
under state laws,"" ibid., and did not allow South Carolina to provide ""an unjust
preference"" to its products ""as against similar products of the other States,""
id., at 101, 41 L. Ed. 632, 17 S. Ct. 265.  The dissent also understood the
validity of the dispensary law to turn in large part on §§ 15 and 23, but argued
that even if these provisions were discriminatory the correct remedy was to
sever them from the rest of the Act.   Id., at 104-106, 41 L. Ed. 632, 17 S. Ct.
265 (opinion of Brown, J.).

Although the Wilson Act increased the States' authority to police liquor
imports, it did not solve all their problems.  In Vance and Rhodes--two cases
decided soon after Scott--the Court made clear that the Wilson Act did not
authorize States to prohibit direct shipments for personal use. In Vance, the
Court characterized Scott as embodying two distinct holdings: First, the South
Carolina dispensary law ""amount[ed] to an  [***814]  unjust discrimination
against liquors, the  [*480]  products of other St"
"            METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER STUDIOS, INC., et al., Petitioners v.                              GROKSTER, LTD., et al.",545 U.S. 913,"

 [***790]  [*918]  [**2770]     Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the
Court.

[***LEdHR1A]  The question is under what circumstances the distributor of a
product capable of both lawful and unlawful use is liable  [*919]  for acts of
copyright infringement by third parties using the product.  We hold that  [HN1]
one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe
copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to
foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third
parties.

Respondents, Grokster, Ltd., and StreamCast Networks, Inc., defendants in the

other types shows up in their substantial and growing popularity.  Because they
need no central computer server to mediate the exchange of information or files
among users, the high-bandwidth communications capacity for a server may be
dispensed with, and the need for costly server storage space is eliminated.
Since copies of a file (particularly a popular one) are available on many users'
computers, file requests and retrievals may be faster than on other types of
networks, and since file exchanges do not travel through a server,
communications can take place between any computers that remain connected to the
network without risk that a glitch in the server will disable the network in its
entirety.  Given these benefits in security, cost, and efficiency, peer-to-peer
networks are employed to store and distribute electronic files by universities,
government agencies, corporations, and libraries,  among others. 1

1 Peer-to-peer networks have disadvantages as well.  Searches on peer-to-peer
networks may not reach and uncover all available files because search requests
may not be transmitted to every computer on the network. There may be redundant
copies of popular files.  The creator of the software has no incentive to
minimize storage or bandwidth consumption, the costs of which are borne by every
user of the network. Most relevant here, it is more difficult to control the
content of files available for retrieval and the behavior of users.

Other users of peer-to-peer networks include individual recipients of Grokster's
and StreamCast's software, and although [**2771]  the networks that they enjoy
through using the software can be used to share any type of digital file, they
have prominently employed those networks in sharing copyrighted music and video
files without authorization.  A group of copyright holders (MGM for short, but
including motion picture studios, recording companies, songwriters, and music
publishers)  sued Grokster and StreamCast for their users' copyright
infringements, alleging that they  [*921]  knowingly and intentionally
distributed their software to enable users to reproduce and distribute the
copyrighted works in violation of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.
(2000 ed. and Supp. II). [***791]  2 MGM sought damages and an injunction.

Discovery during the litigation revealed the way the software worked, the
business aims of each defendant company, and the predilections of the users.
Grokster's eponymous software employs what is known as FastTrack technology, a
protocol developed by others and licensed to Grokster.  StreamCast distributes a
very similar product except that its software, called Morpheus, relies on what
is known as Gnutella technology. 3 A user who downloads and installs either
software possesses the protocol to send requests for files directly to the
computers of others using software compatible with FastTrack or Gnutella.  On
the FastTrack network opened by the Grokster software, the user's request goes
to a computer given an indexing capacity by the software and designated a
supernode, or to some other computer with comparable power and capacity to
collect temporary indexes of the files available on the computers of users
connected to it.  The supernode (or indexing computer) searches its own index
and may  communicate the search request to other supernodes.  If the file is
found, the supernode discloses its location to the computer requesting it, and
the requesting user can download the file directly from the computer located.
The copied file is placed in a designated sharing folder on the requesting
user's computer, where it is available for other users to download in turn,
along with any other file in that folder.

3 Subsequent versions of Morpheus, released after the record was made in this
case, apparently rely not on Gnutella but on a technology called Neonet.  These
developments are not before us.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 [*922]   In the Gnutella network made available by Morpheus, the process is
mostly the same, except that in some versions of the Gnutella protocol there are
no supernodes.  In these versions, peer computers using the protocol communicate
directly with each other.  When a user enters a search request into the Morpheus
software, it sends the request to computers connected with it, which in turn
pass the request along to other connected peers.  The search results are
communicated to the requesting computer, and the user can download desired files
directly from peers' computers.  As this description indicates, Grokster and
StreamCast use no servers to intercept the content of the search requests or to
mediate the file transfers conducted by users of the software, there being no
central point through which the substance of the communications passes in either
direction. 4

4 There is some evidence that both Grokster and StreamCast previously operated
supernodes, which compiled indexes of files available on all of the nodes
connected to them.  This evidence, pertaining to previous versions of the
defendants' software, is not before us and would not affect our conclusions in
any event.

  [**2772]  Although Grokster and StreamCast do not therefore know when
particular files are copied, a few searches using their software would show what
is available on the networks the software reaches.  MGM commissioned a
statistician to conduct a systematic search, and his study showed that nearly
90% of the files available for download on the  [***792]  FastTrack system were
copyrighted works. 5 Grokster and StreamCast dispute this figure, raising
methodological problems and arguing that free copying even of copyrighted works
may be authorized by the rightholders.  They also argue that potential
noninfringing uses of their software are significant in kind, even if infrequent
in practice.  Some musical performers, for example, have gained new audiences by
distributing  [*923]  their copyrighted works for free across peer-to-peer
networks, and some distributors of unprotected content have used peer-to-peer
networks to disseminate files, Shakespeare being an example.  Indeed, StreamCast
has given Morpheus users the opportunity to download the briefs in this very
case, though their popularity has not been quantified.

5 By comparison, evidence introduced by the plaintiffs in A&M Records, Inc. v.
Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004 (CA9 2001), showed that 87% of files available on
the Napster filesharing network were copyrighted, id., at 1013.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 As for quantification, the parties' anecdotal and statistical evidence entered
thus far to show the content available on the FastTrack and Gnutella networks
does not say much about which files are actually downloaded by users, and no one
can say how often the software is used to obtain copies of unprotected material.
But MGM's evidence gives reason to think that the vast majority of users'
downloads are acts of infringement, and because well over 100 million copies of
the software in question are known to have been downloaded, and billions of
files are shared across the FastTrack and Gnutella networks each month, the
probable scope of copyright infringement is staggering.

Grokster and StreamCast concede the infringement in most downloads, Brief for
Respondents 10, n 6, and it is uncontested that they are aware that users employ
their software primarily to download copyrighted files, even if the
decentralized FastTrack and Gnutella networks fail to reveal which files are
being copied, and when.  From time to time, moreover, the companies have learned
about their users' infringement directly, as from users who have sent e-mail to
each company with questions about playing copyrighted movies they had
downloaded, to whom the companies have responded with guidance. 6 App. 559-563,
808-816, 939-954.  And MGM notified the companies of 8 million copyrighted files
that could be obtained using their software.

read them fully.  App. 77, 769.

Grokster and StreamCast are not, however, merely passive recipients of
information about infringing use.  The record is replete with evidence that from
the moment Grokster  [*924]  and StreamCast began to distribute their free
software, each one clearly voiced the objective that recipients use it to
download copyrighted  works, and each took active steps to encourage
infringement.

After the notorious file-sharing service, Napster, was sued by copyright holders
for facilitation of copyright infringement, A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.,
114 F. Supp. 2d 896 (ND Cal. 2000), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 239 F.3d 1004
(CA9 2001), StreamCast gave away a software program of a kind known as OpenNap,
[**2773]  designed as compatible with the Napster program and open  [***793]  to
Napster users for downloading files from other Napster and OpenNap users'
computers.  Evidence indicates that ""[i]t was always [StreamCast's] intent to
use [its OpenNap network] to be able to capture email addresses of [its] initial
target market so that [it] could promote [its] StreamCast Morpheus interface to
them,"" App. 861; indeed, the OpenNap program was engineered ""'to leverage
Napster's 50 million user base,'"" id., at 746.

StreamCast monitored both the number of users downloading its OpenNap program
and the number of music files they downloaded.  Id., at 859, 863, 866.  It also
used the resulting OpenNap network to distribute copies of the Morpheus software
and to encourage users to adopt it.  Id., at 861, 867, 1039.  Internal company
documents indicate that StreamCast hoped to attract large numbers of former
Napster users if that company was shut down by court order or otherwise, and
that StreamCast planned to be the next Napster.  Id., at 861.  A kit developed
by StreamCast to be delivered to advertisers, for example, contained press
articles about StreamCast's potential to capture former Napster users, id., at
568-572, and it introduced itself to some potential advertisers as a company
""which is similar to what Napster was,"" id., at 884.  It broadcast banner
advertisements to users of other Napster-compatible software, urging them to
adopt its OpenNap.  Id., at 586.  An internal e-mail from a company executive
stated: ""'We have put this network in  [*925]  place so that when Napster pulls
the plug on their free service . . . or if the Court orders them shut down prior
to that . . . we will be positioned to capture the flood of their 32 million
users that will be actively looking for an alternative.'"" Id., at 588-589, 861.

Thus, StreamCast developed promotional materials to market its service as the
best Napster alternative.  One proposed advertisement read: ""Napster Inc. has
announced that it will soon begin charging you a fee.  That's if the courts
don't order it shut down first.  What will you do to get around it?"" Id., at
897.  Another proposed ad touted StreamCast's software as the ""#1 alternative to
Napster"" and asked ""[w]hen the lights went off at Napster . . . where did the
users go?"" Id., at 836 (ellipsis in original). 7  StreamCast even planned to
flaunt the illegal uses of its software; when it launched the OpenNap network,
the chief technology officer of the company averred that ""[t]he goal is to get
in trouble with the law and get sued.  It's the best way to get in the new[s].""
Id., at 916.

7 The record makes clear that StreamCast developed these promotional materials
but not whether it released them to the public.  Even if these advertisements
were not released to the public and do not show encouragement to infringe, they
illuminate StreamCast's purposes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The evidence that Grokster sought to capture the market of former Napster users
is sparser but revealing, for Grokster launched its own OpenNap system called
Swaptor and inserted digital codes into its Web site so that computer users
using Web search engines to look for ""Napster"" or ""[f]ree filesharing"" would be
directed to the Grokster Web site, where they could download the Grokster
software. Id., at 992-993.  And Grokster's name is an apparent derivative of
Napster.

StreamCast's executives monitored  [***794]  the number of songs by certain
commercial artists available on their networks, and an internal communication
indicates they aimed to have a larger number of copyrighted songs available on
their networks  [*926]  than other file-sharing networks.  [**2774] Id., at 868.
The point, of course, would be to attract users of a mind to infringe, just as
it would be with their promotional materials developed showing copyrighted songs
as examples of the kinds of files available through Morpheus.  Id., at 848.
Morpheus in fact allowed users to search specifically for ""Top 40"" songs, id.,
at 735, which were inevitably copyrighted. Similarly, Grokster sent users a
newsletter promoting its ability to provide particular, popular copyrighted
materials.  Brief for Motion Picture Studio and Recording Company Petitioners
7-8.

In addition to this evidence of express promotion, marketing, and intent to
promote further, the business models employed by Grokster and StreamCast confirm
that their  principal object was use of their software to download copyrighted
works.  Grokster and StreamCast receive no revenue from users, who obtain the
software itself for nothing.  Instead, both companies generate income by selling
advertising space, and they stream the advertising to Grokster and Morpheus
users while they are employing the programs.  As the number of users of each
program increases, advertising opportunities become worth more.  Cf. App. 539,
804.  While there is doubtless some demand for free Shakespeare, the evidence
shows that substantive volume is a function of free access to copyrighted work.
Users seeking Top 40 songs, for example, or the latest release by Modest Mouse,
are certain to be far more numerous than those seeking a free Decameron, and
Grokster and StreamCast translated that demand into dollars.

Finally, there is no evidence that either company made an effort to filter
copyrighted material from users' downloads or otherwise impede the sharing of
copyrighted files.  Although Grokster appears to have sent e-mails warning users
about infringing content when it received threatening notice from the copyright
holders, it never blocked anyone from continuing to use its software to share
copyrighted files.  [*927]  Id., at 75-76.  StreamCast not only rejected another
company's offer of help to monitor infringement, id., at 928-929, but blocked
the Internet Protocol addresses of entities it believed were trying to engage in
such monitoring on its networks, id., at 917-922.

After discovery, the parties on each side of the case cross-moved for summary
judgment. The District Court limited its consideration to the asserted liability
of Grokster and StreamCast for distributing the current versions of their
software, leaving aside whether either was liable ""for damages arising from past
versions of their software, or from other past activities."" 259 F. Supp. 2d
1029, 1033 (CD Cal. 2003).  The District Court held that those who used the
Grokster and Morpheus software to download copyrighted media files directly
infringed MGM's copyrights, a conclusion not contested on appeal, but the court
nonetheless granted summary judgment in favor of Grokster and StreamCast as to
any liability arising from distribution of  [***795]  the then current versions
of their software. Distributing that software gave rise to no liability in the
court's view, because its use did not provide the distributors with actual
knowledge of specific acts of infringement. Case No. CV 01 08541 SVW (PJWx) (CD
Cal., June 18, 2003), App. 1213.

The Court of Appeals affirmed.  380 F.3d 1154 (CA9 2004).  In the court's
analysis, a defendant was liable as a contributory infringer when it had
knowledge of direct infringement and materially contributed to the infringement.
But the court read  [**2775]  Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios,
Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 78 L. Ed. 2d 574, 104 S. Ct. 774 (1984), as holding that
distribution of a commercial product capable of substantial noninfringing uses
could not give rise to contributory liability for infringement unless the
distributor had actual knowledge of specific instances of infringement and
failed to act on that knowledge.  The fact that the software was capable of
substantial noninfringing uses in the Ninth Circuit's view meant  [*928]  that
Grokster and StreamCast were not liable, because they had no such actual
knowledge, owing to the decentralized architecture of their software. The court
also held that Grokster and StreamCast did not materially contribute to their
users' infringement because it was the users themselves who searched for,
retrieved, and stored the infringing files, with no involvement by the
defendants beyond providing the software in the first place.

The Ninth Circuit also considered whether Grokster and StreamCast could be
liable under a theory of vicarious infringement. The court held against
liability because the defendants did not monitor or control the use of the
software, had no agreed-upon right or current ability to supervise its use, and
had no independent duty to police infringement. We granted certiorari.  543 U.S.
1032, 160 L. Ed. 2d 518, 125 S. Ct. 686 (2004).

A

MGM and many of the amici fault the Court of Appeals's holding for upsetting a
sound balance between the respective values of supporting creative pursuits
through copyright protection and promoting innovation in new communication
technologies by limiting the incidence of liability for copyright infringement.
The more artistic protection is favored, the more technological innovation may
be discouraged; the administration of copyright law is an exercise in managing
the tradeoff.  See Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, supra, at 442, 78 L.
Ed. 2d 574, 104 S. Ct. 774; see generally Ginsburg, Copyright and Control Over
New Technologies of Dissemination, 101 Colum. L. Rev. 1613 (2001); Lichtman &
Landes, Indirect Liability for Copyright Infringement: An Economic Perspective,
16 Harv. J. L. & Tech. 395 (2003).

The tension between the two values is the subject of this case, with its claim
that digital distribution of copyrighted material threatens copyright holders as
never before, because every copy is identical to the original, copying is easy,
[*929]  and many people (especially the young) use file-sharing software to
download copyrighted works.  This very breadth of the software's use may well
draw the public directly into the debate over copyright policy, Peters, Brace
Memorial  [***796]  Lecture: Copyright Enters the Public Domain, 51 J. Copyright
Soc. 701, 705-717 (2004) (address by Register of Copyrights), and the
indications are that the ease of copying songs or movies using software like
Grokster's and Napster's is fostering disdain for copyright protection, Wu, When
Code Isn't Law, 89 Va. L. Rev. 679, 724-726 (2003).  As the case has been
presented to us, these fears are said to be offset by the different concern that
imposing liability, not only on infringers but on distributors of software based
on its potential for unlawful use, could limit further development of beneficial
technologies. See, e.g., Lemley & Reese, Reducing Digital Copyright Infringement
Without Restricting Innovation,  56 Stan. L. Rev. 1345, 1386-1390 (2004); Brief
for Innovation Scholars and Economists as Amici Curiae 15-20; Brief for Emerging

as Amicus Curiae 20-22. 8

8 The mutual exclusivity of these values should not be overstated, however.  On
the one hand technological innovators, including those writing filesharing
computer programs, may wish for effective copyright protections for their work.
See, e.g., Wu, When Code Isn't Law, 89 Va. L. Rev. 679, 750 (2003).  (StreamCast
itself was urged by an associate to ""get [its] technology written down and [its
intellectual property] protected."" App. 866.) On the other hand the widespread
distribution of creative works through improved technologies may enable the
synthesis of new works or generate audiences for emerging artists.  See Eldred
v. Ashcroft, 537 U.S. 186, 223-226, 154 L. Ed. 2d 683, 123 S. Ct. 769 (2003)

  [***LEdHR2A]  The argument for imposing indirect liability in this case is,
however, a powerful one, given the number of infringing downloads that occur
every day using StreamCast's and Grokster's software.  [HN2] When a widely
shared service or product is used to commit infringement, it may be impossible
to  [*930]  enforce rights in the protected work effectively against all direct
infringers, the only practical alternative being to go against the distributor
of the copying device for secondary liability on a theory of contributory or
vicarious infringement. See In re Aimster Copyright Litigation, 334 F.3d 643,
645-646 (CA7 2003).

[HN3]  [***LEdHR1A]  One infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or
encouraging direct infringement, see Gershwin Pub. Corp. v. Columbia Artists
Management, Inc., 443 F.2d 1159, 1162 (CA2 1971), and infringes vicariously by
profiting from direct infringement while declining to exercise a right to stop
or limit it, Shapiro, Bernstein & Co. v. H. L. Green Co., 316 F.2d 304, 307 (CA2
1963). 9 Although ""[t]he Copyright Act does not expressly render anyone liable

417, 78 L. Ed. 2d 574, 104 S. Ct. 774 (1984), that ""'the lines between direct
infringement, contributory infringement and vicarious liability are not clearly
drawn' . . . .  [R]easoned analysis of [the Sony plaintiffs' contributory
infringement claim] necessarily entails consideration of arguments and case law
which may also be forwarded under the other labels, and indeed the parties . . .

America, 480 F. Supp. 429, 457-458 (CD Cal. 1979)).  In the present case MGM has
argued a vicarious liability theory, which allows imposition of liability when
the defendant profits directly from the infringement and has a right and ability
to supervise the direct infringer, even if the defendant initially lacks
knowledge of the infringement. See, e.g., Shapiro, Bernstein & Co. v. H. L.
Green Co., 316 F.2d 304, 308 (CA2 1963); Dreamland Ball Room, Inc. v. Shapiro,
Bernstein & Co., 36 F.2d 354, 355 (CA7 1929).  Because we resolve the case based
on an inducement theory, there is no need to analyze separately MGM's vicarious
liability theory.

Despite the currency of these principles of secondary liability, this Court has
dealt with secondary copyright infringement in only one recent case, and because
MGM has tailored its principal claim to our opinion there, a look at our earlier
holding is in order.  In  [**2777]  Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, supra,
this Court addressed a claim that secondary liability for infringement can arise
from the very distribution of a commercial product.  There, the product, novel
at the time, was what we know today as the videocassette recorder or VCR.
Copyright holders sued Sony as the manufacturer, claiming it was contributorily
liable for infringement that occurred when VCR owners taped copyrighted programs
because it supplied the means used to infringe, and it had constructive
knowledge that infringement would occur.  At the trial on the merits, the
evidence showed that the principal use of the VCR was for ""§ 'time-shifting,'""
or taping a program for later viewing at a more convenient time, which the Court
found to be a fair, not an infringing, use.  Id., at 423-424,78 L. Ed. 2d 574,
104 S. Ct. 774.  There was no evidence that Sony had expressed an object of
bringing about taping in violation of copyright or had taken active steps to
increase its profits from unlawful taping.  Id., at 438, 78 L. Ed. 2d 574, 104
S. Ct. 774.  Although Sony's advertisements urged consumers to buy the VCR to
""'record favorite shows'"" or ""'build a library'"" of recorded programs, id., at
459, 78 L. Ed. 2d 574, 104 S. Ct. 774 (Blackmun, J., dissenting), neither of
these uses was necessarily infringing, id., at 424, 454-455, 78 L. Ed. 2d 574,
104 S. Ct. 774.

On those facts, with no evidence of stated or indicated intent to promote
infringing uses, the only conceivable basis for imposing liability was on a
theory of contributory infringement arising from its sale of VCRs to consumers
with knowledge that some would use them to infringe. Id., at 439, 78 L. Ed. 2d
574, 104 S. Ct. 774.  But because the VCR was ""capable of commercially
significant noninfringing uses,"" we held the manufacturer  [*932]  could not be
faulted solely on the basis of its distribution.  Id., at 442, 78 L. Ed. 2d 574,
104 S. Ct. 774.

[***LEdHR3] [3] This analysis reflected patent law's traditional staple article
of commerce doctrine, now codified, that distribution of a component of a

 [*553]  [**2058]  [***902]    JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the
Court.

For the third time in eight years, we consider whether a federal program that
finances generic advertising to promote an agricultural product violates the
First Amendment. In these cases, unlike the previous two, the dispositive
question is whether the generic advertising at issue is the Government's own
speech and therefore is exempt from First Amendment scrutiny.

I

A

[HN1] The Beef Promotion and Research Act of 1985 (Beef Act or Act), 99 Stat.
1597, announces a federal policy of promoting the marketing and consumption of
""beef and beef products,"" using funds raised by an assessment on cattle sales
and importation. 7 U.S.C. § 2901(b). The statute directs the Secretary of
Agriculture to implement this policy by issuing a Beef Promotion and Research
Order (Beef Order or Order), § 2903, and specifies four key terms it must
contain: The Secretary is to appoint a Cattlemen's Beef Promotion and Research
Board (Beef Board or Board), whose members are to be a geographically
representative group of beef producers and importers, nominated by trade
associations. § 2904(1). The Beef Board is to convene  [***903]  an Operating
Committee, composed of 10 Beef Board members and 10 representatives  [*554]
named by a federation of state beef councils. § 2904(4)(A). The Secretary is to
impose a $ 1-per-head assessment (or ""checkoff"") on all sales or importation of
cattle and a comparable assessment on imported beef products. § 2904(8). And the
assessment is to be used to fund beef-related projects, including promotional
campaigns, designed by the Operating Committee and approved by the Secretary. §§
2904(4)(B), (C).

The Secretary promulgated the Beef Order with the specified terms.  [HN2] The
assessment is collected primarily by state beef councils, which then forward the
proceeds to the Beef Board. 7 CFR § 1260.172(a)(5) (2004). 1 The Operating
[**2059]  Committee proposes projects to be funded by the checkoff, including
promotion and research. § 1260.167(a). The Secretary or his designee (see §§
2.22(a)(1)(viii)(X), 2.79(a)(8)(xxxii))  approves each project and, in the case
of promotional materials, the content of each communication. §§ 1260.168(e),
1260.169; App. 114, 143.

1 In most cases, only 50 cents per head is remitted to the Beef Board, because
the Beef Act and Beef Order allow domestic producers to deduct from their $ 1
assessment up to 50 cents in voluntary contributions to their state beef
councils. 7 U.S.C. § 2904(8)(C); 7 CFR § 1260.172(a)(3) (2004).

The Beef Order was promulgated in 1986 on a temporary basis, subject to a
referendum among beef producers on whether to make it permanent. 7 U.S.C. §§
2903, 2906(a). In May 1988, a large majority voted to continue it. Since that
time, more than $ 1 billion has been collected through the checkoff,  2001 DSD
5, 132 F. Supp. 2d 817, 820 (SD 2001), and a large fraction of that sum has been
spent on promotional projects authorized by the Beef Act -- many using the
familiar trademarked slogan ""Beef. It's What's for Dinner."" App. 50. In fiscal
year 2000, for example, the Beef Board collected over $ 48 million in
assessments and spent over $ 29 million on domestic promotion. The Board also
funds overseas marketing efforts; market and food-science research, such as
evaluations of the nutritional value of beef; and informational  [*555]
campaigns for both consumers and beef producers. See 7 U.S.C. §§ 2902(6), (9),
(15), 2904(4)(B).

Many promotional messages funded by the checkoff (though not all, see App.
52-53) bear the attribution ""Funded by America's Beef Producers."" E.g., id., at
50-51. Most print and television messages also bear a Beef Board logo, usually a
checkmark with the word ""BEEF."" E.g., id., at 50-52.

B

Respondents are two associations whose members collect and pay the checkoff, and
several individuals who raise and sell cattle subject to the checkoff. Id., at
17-19. They sued the Secretary, the Department of Agriculture, and the Board in
Federal District Court on a number of constitutional and statutory grounds not
before us -- in particular, that the Board impermissibly used checkoff funds to
send communications supportive of the beef program to beef producers.  132 F.
Supp. 2d, at 823. Petitioners in No. 03-1165, a state beef producers'
association and two  [***904]  individual producers, intervened as defendants to
argue in support of the program. The District Court granted a limited
preliminary injunction, which forbade the continued use of checkoff funds to
laud the beef program or to lobby for governmental action relating to the
checkoff.  Id., at 832.

While the litigation was pending, we held in  United States v. United Foods,
Inc., 533 U.S. 405, 150 L. Ed. 2d 438, 121 S. Ct. 2334 (2001), that a mandatory
checkoff for generic mushroom advertising violated the First Amendment. Noting
that the mushroom program closely resembles the beef program, 2 respondents
amended their  [*556]  complaint to assert a First Amendment challenge to the
use of the beef checkoff for promotional activity.  2002 DSD 18, 207 F. Supp. 2d
992, 996 (SD 2002); App. 30-32. Respondents noted that the advertising promotes
beef as a generic commodity, which, they contended, impedes their  [**2060]
efforts  to promote the superiority of, inter alia, American beef, grain-fed
beef, or certified Angus or Hereford beef.

2 The Department of Agriculture oversees similar programs of promotional
advertising, funded by checkoffs, for a number of other agricultural
commodities. See 7 CFR § 1205.10 et seq. (2004) (cotton); § 1207.301 et seq.
(potatoes); § 1210.301 et seq. (watermelons); § 1215.1 et seq. (popcorn); §
1216.1 et seq. (peanuts); § 1218.1 et seq. (blueberries); § 1219.1 et seq. (Hass
avocados); § 1220.101 et seq. (soybeans); § 1230.1 et seq. (pork); § 1240.1 et
seq. (honey); § 1250.301 et seq. (eggs); § 1280.101 et seq. (lamb).

 After a bench trial, the District Court ruled for respondents on their First
Amendment claim. It declared that the Beef Act and Beef Order unconstitutionally
compel respondents to subsidize speech to which they object, and rejected the
Government's contention that the checkoff survives First Amendment scrutiny
because it funds only government speech.  207 F. Supp. 2d, at 1002-1007. The
court entered a permanent injunction barring any further collection of the beef
checkoff, even from producers willing to pay (allowing continued collection of
voluntary checkoffs, the court thought, would require ""rewriting"" the Beef Act).
Id., at 1007-1008. Believing that the cost of calculating the share of the
checkoff attributable to the compelled subsidy would be too great, the court
also declined to order a refund of checkoff funds already collected. Ibid.
Finally, the court made permanent its earlier injunction against ""producer
communications"" praising the beef program or seeking to influence governmental
policy.  Id., at 1008. The court did not rule on respondents' other claims, but
certified its resolution of the First Amendment claim as final pursuant to
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).  207 F. Supp. 2d, at 1008.

The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.  335 F.3d 711 (2003).
Unlike the District Court, the Court of Appeals did not dispute that the
challenged advertising is government speech; instead, it held that government
speech status is relevant only to First Amendment challenges to the speech's
content, not to challenges to its compelled funding. See  id., at 720-721.
Compelled funding of speech, it held,  [*557]  may violate the First Amendment
even if the speech in question is the government's. Ibid.

We granted certiorari.  541 U.S. 1062, 158 L. Ed. 2d 962, 124 S. Ct. 2390 (2004)
.

[***905]  II

[HN3] We have sustained First Amendment challenges to allegedly compelled
expression in two categories of cases: true ""compelled-speech"" cases, in which
an individual is obliged personally to express a message he disagrees with,
imposed by the government; and ""compelled-subsidy"" cases, in which an individual
is required by the government to subsidize a message he disagrees with,
expressed by a private entity. We have not heretofore considered the First
Amendment consequences of government-compelled subsidy of the government's own
speech.

We first invalidated an outright compulsion of speech in  West Virginia Bd. of
Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 87 L. Ed. 1628, 63 S. Ct. 1178 (1943). The State
required every schoolchild to recite the Pledge of Allegiance while saluting the
American flag, on pain of expulsion from the public schools. We held that  [HN4]
the First Amendment does not ""leave it open to public authorities to compel [a
person] to utter"" a message with which he does not agree.  Id., at 634, 87 L.
Ed. 1628, 63 S. Ct. 1178. Likewise, in  Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 51 L.
Ed. 2d 752, 97 S. Ct. 1428 (1977), we held that requiring a New Hampshire couple
to bear the State's motto, ""Live Free or Die,"" on their cars' license plates was
an impermissible compulsion of expression. Obliging people to ""use their private
property as a 'mobile billboard' for the State's ideological message"" amounted
to impermissible compelled expression.  Id., at 715, 51 L. Ed. 2d 752, 97 S. Ct.
1428.

The reasoning of these compelled-speech cases has been carried over to certain
instances in which individuals are compelled  [**2061]  not to speak, but to
subsidize a private message with which they disagree. Thus, although we have
upheld state-imposed requirements that lawyers be members of the state bar and
pay its annual dues, and that public school  [*558]  teachers either join the
labor union representing their ""shop"" or pay ""service fees"" equal to the union
dues, we have invalidated the use of the compulsory fees to fund speech on
political matters. See  Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U.S. 1, 110 L. Ed. 2d
1, 110 S. Ct. 2228 (1990);  Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U.S. 209, 52 L. Ed.
2d 261, 97 S. Ct. 1782 (1977). Bar or union speech with such content, we held,
was not germane to the regulatory interests that justified compelled membership,
and accordingly, making those who disagreed with it pay for it violated the
First Amendment. See  Keller, supra, at 15-16, 110 L. Ed. 2d 1, 110 S. Ct. 2228;
Abood, supra, at 234-235, 52 L. Ed. 2d 261, 97 S. Ct. 1782.

These latter cases led us to sustain a compelled-subsidy challenge to an
assessment very similar to the beef checkoff, imposed to fund mushroom
advertising.  United Foods, supra; see  335 F.3d at 717 (""We agree with the
district court that 'the beef checkoff is, in all material respects, identical
to the mushroom checkoff'"" at issue in United Foods). Deciding the case on the
assumption that the advertising was private speech,  not government speech, see
533 U.S., at 416-417, 150 L. Ed. 2d 438, 121 S. Ct. 2334, 3 we concluded that
Abood and Keller were controlling. As in those cases, mushroom producers were
[***906]  obliged by ""law or necessity"" to pay the checkoff; although Abood and
Keller would permit the mandatory fee if it were ""germane"" to a ""broader
regulatory scheme,"" in  [*559]  United Foods the only regulatory purpose was the
funding of the advertising.  533 U.S., at 413, 415-416, 150 L. Ed. 2d 438, 121
S. Ct. 2334.

3 In United Foods, the Court distinguished (and the dissent relied on)  Glickman
v. Wileman Brothers & Elliott, Inc., 521 U.S. 457, 138 L. Ed. 2d 585, 117 S. Ct.
2130 (1997), which upheld the use of mandatory assessments to fund generic
advertising promoting California tree fruit. In Glickman, as in United Foods,
the Government did not argue that the advertising was permissible government
speech. See  521 U.S., at 482, n. 2, 138 L. Ed. 2d 585, 117 S. Ct. 2130 (SOUTER,
J., dissenting) (noting that the Government had waived any such argument).
Rather, the Government contended, and we agreed, that compelled support for
generic advertising was legitimately part of the Government's ""collectivist""
centralization of the market for tree fruit.  Id., at 475, 138 L. Ed. 2d 585,
117 S. Ct. 2130 (opinion of the Court). Here, as in United Foods, ""there is no
broader regulatory system in place"" that collectivizes aspects of the beef
market unrelated to speech, so Glickman is not controlling.  533 U.S., at 415,
150 L. Ed. 2d 438, 120 S. Ct. 2334.

 In all of the cases invalidating exactions to subsidize speech, the speech was,
or was presumed to be, that of an entity other than the government itself. See
Keller, supra, at 11, 15-16, 110 L. Ed. 2d 1, 110 S. Ct. 2228;  Abood, supra, at
212-213, 52 L. Ed. 2d 261, 97 S. Ct. 1782;  United Foods, supra, at 416-417, 150
L. Ed. 2d 438, 121 S. Ct. 2334; see also  Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis.
System v. Southworth, 529 U.S. 217, 229, 230, 146 L. Ed. 2d 193, 120 S. Ct. 1346
(2000) (because ""the University has disclaimed that the speech is its own,""
Abood and Keller ""provide the beginning point for our analysis""); cf.
Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 851-852, 132
L. Ed. 2d 700, 115 S. Ct. 2510 (1995) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring) (university's
Student Activities Fund likely does not unconstitutionally compel speech because
it ""represents not government resources . . . but a fund that simply belongs to
the students"").  [HN5] Our compelled-subsidy cases have consistently respected
the principle that ""compelled support of a private association is fundamentally
different from compelled support of government.""  Abood, supra, at 259, n.
[**2062]  13, 52 L. Ed. 2d 261, 97 S. Ct. 1782 (Powell, J., concurring in
judgment). ""Compelled support of government"" -- even those programs of
government one does not approve -- is of course perfectly constitutional, as
every taxpayer must attest. And some government programs involve, or entirely
consist of, advocating a position. ""The government, as a general rule, may
support valid programs and policies by taxes or other exactions binding on
protesting parties. Within this broader principle it seems inevitable that funds
raised by the government will be spent for speech and other expression to
advocate and defend its own policies.""  Southworth, 529 U.S., at 229, 146 L. Ed.
2d 193, 120 S. Ct. 1346. We have generally assumed, though not yet squarely
held, that compelled funding of government speech does not alone raise First
Amendment concerns. See ibid.;  Keller, supra, at 12-13, 110 L. Ed. 2d 1, 110 S.
Ct. 2228;  Rosenberger, supra, at 833, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700, 115 S. Ct. 2510; see
also  Wooley, supra, at 721, 51 L. Ed. 2d 752, 97 S. Ct. 1428 (REHNQUIST, J.,
dissenting).

[*560]  III

Respondents do not seriously dispute these principles, nor do they contend that,
as a general matter, their First Amendment challenge requires them to show only
that their checkoff dollars pay for speech  [***907]  with which they disagree.
Rather, they assert that the challenged promotional campaigns differ
dispositively from the type of government speech that, our cases suggest, is not
susceptible to First Amendment challenge. They point to the role of the Beef
Board and its Operating Committee in designing the promotional campaigns, and to
the use of a mandatory assessment on beef producers to fund the advertising. We
consider each in turn.

A

The Secretary of Agriculture does not write ad copy himself. Rather, the Beef
Board's promotional campaigns are designed by the Beef Board's Operating
Committee, only half of whose members are Beef Board members appointed by the
Secretary. (All members of the Operating Committee are subject to removal by the
Secretary. 7 CFR § 1260.213 (2004).) Respondents contend that speech whose
content is effectively controlled by a nongovernmental entity -- the Operating
Committee -- cannot be considered ""government speech."" We need not address this
contention, because we reject its premise: The message of the promotional
campaigns is effectively controlled by the Federal Government itself. 4

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - Footnotes - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

4 We therefore need not label the Operating Committee as ""governmental"" or
""nongovernmental."" The entity to which assessments are remitted is the Beef
Board, all of whose members are appointed by the Secretary pursuant to law. The
Operating Committee's only relevant involvement is ancillary -- it designs the
promotional campaigns, which the Secretary supervises and approves -- and its
status as a state actor thus is not directly at issue.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 The message set out in the beef promotions is from beginning to end the message
established by the Federal Government. 5  [HN6]  [*561]  Congress has directed
[**2063] the implementation of a ""coordinated program"" of promotion, ""including
paid advertising, to advance the image and desirability of beef and beef
products."" 7 U.S.C. §§ 2901(b), 2902(13). Congress and the Secretary have also
specified, in general terms, what the promotional campaigns shall contain, see,
e.g., § 2904(4)(B)(i) (campaigns ""shall . . . take into account"" different types
of beef products), and what they shall not, see, e.g., 7 CFR § 1260.169(d)
(2004) (campaigns shall not, without prior approval, refer ""to a brand or trade
name of any beef product""). Thus, Congress and the Secretary have set out the
overarching message and some of its elements, and they have left the development
of the remaining details to an entity whose members are answerable to the
Secretary (and in some cases appointed by him as well).

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - Footnotes - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

5 The principal dissent suggests that if this is so, then the Government has
adopted at best a mixed message, because it also promulgates dietary guidelines
that, if followed, would discourage excessive consumption of beef. Post, at 577,
n. 5 (opinion of SOUTER, J.); see also post, at 569-570 (GINSBURG, J.,
concurring in judgment). Even if we agreed that the protection of the
government-speech doctrine must be forfeited whenever there is inconsistency in
the message, we would nonetheless accord the protection here. The beef
promotions are perfectly compatible with the guidelines' message of moderate
consumption -- the ads do not insist that beef is also What's for Breakfast,
Lunch, and Midnight Snack.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 Moreover, the record demonstrates that the Secretary exercises final approval
authority over every word used in every promotional campaign. All proposed
promotional messages are reviewed by Department officials both for substance and
for wording,  [***908]  and some proposals are rejected or rewritten by the
Department. App. 114, 118-121, 274-275. Nor is the Secretary's role limited to
final approval or rejection: Officials of the Department also attend and
participate in the open meetings at which proposals are developed. Id., at
111-112.

This degree of governmental control over the message funded by the checkoff
distinguishes these cases from Keller.  [*562]  There the state bar's
communicative activities to which the plaintiffs objected were not prescribed by
law in their general outline and not developed under official government
supervision. Indeed, many of them consisted of lobbying the state legislature on
various issues. See  496 U.S., at 5, 110 L. Ed. 2d 1, 110 S. Ct. 2228, and n. 2.
[HN7] When, as here, the government sets the overall message to be communicated
and approves every word that is disseminated, it is not precluded from relying
on the government-speech doctrine merely because it solicits assistance from
nongovernmental sources in developing specific messages.

B

Respondents also contend that the beef program does not qualify as ""government
speech"" because it is funded by a targeted assessment on beef producers, rather
than by general revenues. This funding mechanism, they argue, has two relevant
effects: It gives control over the beef program not to politically accountable
legislators, but to a narrow interest group that will pay no heed to
respondents' dissenting views, and it creates the perception that the
advertisements speak for beef producers such as respondents.

We reject the first point. The compelled-subsidy analysis is altogether
unaffected by whether the funds for the promotions are raised by general taxes
or through a targeted assessment.  [HN8] Citizens may challenge compelled
support of private speech, but have no First Amendment right not to fund
government speech. And that is no less true when the funding is achieved through
targeted assessments devoted exclusively to the program to which the assessed
citizens object. Cf.  United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 260, 71 L. Ed. 2d 127,
102 S. Ct. 1051 (1982) (""There is no principled way . . . to distinguish between
general taxes and those imposed under the Social Security Act"" in evaluating the
burden on the right to free exercise of religion). The First Amendment does not
confer a right to pay one's taxes  [*563]  into the general fund, because the
injury of compelled funding (as opposed to the injury of compelled speech) does
not stem from the Government's mode of accounting. Cf.  [**2064]   Bowen v. Roy,
476 U.S. 693, 700, 90 L. Ed. 2d 735, 106 S. Ct. 2147 (1986) (""The Free Exercise
Clause . . . does not afford an individual a right to dictate the conduct of the
Government's internal procedures"");  id., at 716-717, 90 L. Ed. 2d 735, 106 S.
Ct. 2147 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and concurring in result).

Some of our cases have justified compelled funding of government speech by
pointing out that government speech is subject to democratic accountability.
See, e.g.,  Abood, 431 U.S., at 259, n. 13, 52 L. Ed. 2d 261, 97 S. Ct. 1782
(Powell, J., concurring in judgment);  Southworth, 529 U.S., at 235, 146 L. Ed.
2d 193, 120 S. Ct. 1346. But our references to ""traditional political controls,""
[***909]   id., at 229, 146 L. Ed. 2d 193, 120 S. Ct. 1346, do not signify that
the First Amendment duplicates the Appropriations Clause, U.S. Const., Art. I, §
9, cl. 7, or that every instance of government speech must be funded by a line
item in an appropriations bill. Here, the beef advertisements are subject to
political safeguards more than adequate to set them apart from private messages.
The program is authorized and the basic message prescribed by federal statute,
and specific requirements for the promotions' content are imposed by federal
regulations promulgated after notice and comment. The Secretary of Agriculture,
a politically accountable official, oversees the program, appoints and dismisses
the key personnel, and retains absolute veto power over the advertisements'
content, right down to the wording. 6 And Congress, of course, retains oversight
authority, not to mention  [*564]  the ability to reform the program at any
time. No more is required. 7

6 Congress also required a referendum among producers before permanently
implementing the checkoff, and allowed the Secretary to call another referendum
upon demand of a ""representative group"" comprising 10 percent of cattle
producers. 7 U.S.C. §§ 2906(a)-(b). Even before they amended their complaint to
challenge the checkoff as compelled speech, respondents were seeking in this
litigation to force such a referendum. See  2002 DSD 18, 207 F. Supp. 2d 992,
995 (SD 2002).

7 The principal dissent finds some ""First Amendment affront"" in all compelled
funding of government speech -- and when, it says, ""a targeted assessment . . .
makes the First Amendment affront more galling, . . . greater care is required
to ensure that the political process can practically respond to limit the
compulsion."" Post, at 576. That greater care consists, the dissent says, of a
requirement that government speech funded by a targeted assessment must identify
government as the speaker. Post, at 576-578. The dissent cites no prior
practice, no precedent, and no authority for this highly refined elaboration --
not even anyone who has ever before thought of it. It is more than we think can
be found within ""Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of
speech."" Of course, nothing in the Beef Act or Beef Order prevents the
Government from identifying itself as sponsor of the ads -- much less requires
concealment of the ads' provenance -- so even if it were correct, this theory
would not sustain the judgment below, which altogether enjoined the Act and the
Order. But the correct focus is not on whether the ads' audience realizes the
Government is speaking, but on the compelled assessment's purported interference
with respondents' First Amendment rights. As we hold today, respondents enjoy no
right not to fund government speech -- whether by broad-based taxes or targeted
assessments, and whether or not the reasonable viewer would identify the speech
as the government's. If a viewer would identify the speech as respondents',
however, the analysis would be different. See infra, at 565-567, and n. 8.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 As to the second point, respondents' argument proceeds as follows: They contend
that crediting the advertising to ""America's Beef Producers"" impermissibly uses
not only their money but also their seeming endorsement to promote a message
with which they do not agree. Communications cannot be ""government speech,"" they
argue, if they are attributed to someone other than the government; and the
[**2065]  person to whom they are attributed, when he is, by compulsory funding,
made the unwilling instrument of communication, may raise a First Amendment
objection.

We need not determine the validity of this argument -- which relates to
compelled speech rather than compelled  [*565]  subsidy 8 -- with regard
[***910]  to respondents' facial challenge. Since neither the Beef Act nor the
Beef Order requires attribution, neither can be the cause of any possible First
Amendment harm. The District Court's order enjoining the enforcement of the Act
and the Order thus cannot be sustained on this theory.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - Footnotes - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

8 The principal dissent conflates the two concepts into something it describes
as citizens'""presumptive autonomy as speakers to decide what to say and what to
pay for others to say."" Post, at 576. As we discuss in the text, there might be
a valid objection if ""those singled out to pay the tax are closely linked with
the expression"" (post, at 575-576) in a way that makes them appear to endorse
the government message. But this compelled-speech argument (like the Wooley and
Barnette opinions on which it draws) differs substantively from the
compelled-subsidy analysis. The latter invalidates an exaction not because being
forced to pay for speech that is unattributed violates personal autonomy, but
because being forced to fund someone else's private speech unconnected to any
legitimate government purpose violates personal autonomy. Supra, at 557-558
(discussing Keller and Abood). Such a violation does not occur when the exaction
funds government speech. Apportioning the burden of funding government
operations (including speech) through taxes and other levies does not violate
autonomy simply because individual taxpayers feel ""singled out"" or find the
exaction ""galling,"" post, at 575-576, and n. 4.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 On some set of facts, this second theory might (again, we express no view on
the point) form the basis for an as-applied challenge -- if it were established,
that is, that individual beef advertisements were attributed to respondents. The
record, however, includes only a stipulated sampling of these promotional
materials, see App. 47, and none of the exemplars provides any support for this
attribution theory except for the tagline identifying the funding. Respondents
apparently presented no other evidence of attribution at trial, and the District
Court made no factual findings on the point. Indeed, in the only trial testimony
on the subject that any party has identified, an employee of one of the
respondent associations said he did not think the beef promotions would  [*566]
be attributed to his group. 9 Whether the individual respondents who are beef
producers would be associated with speech labeled as coming from ""America's Beef
Producers"" is a question on which the trial record is altogether silent. We have
only the funding tagline itself, a trademarked term 10 that, standing alone, is
not sufficiently specific to convince a reasonable factfinder that any
particular beef producer, or all beef producers, would be tarred  [**2066] with
the  content of each trademarked ad. 11 We therefore conclude that  [*567]  on
the record before us  [***911]  an as-applied First Amendment challenge to the
individual advertisements affords no basis on which to sustain the Eighth
Circuit's judgment, even in part.

 [**2402]  [*177]   Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A]  [***LEdHR2A] [2A]  [***LEdHR3A] [3A] This case concerns
respondent John David Stumpf's conviction and death sentence for the murder of
Mary Jane Stout.  In adjudicating Stumpf's petition for a writ of habeas corpus,
the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted him relief on
two grounds: that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary, and intelligent,
and that his conviction and sentence could not stand because the State, in a
later trial of Stumpf's accomplice, pursued a theory of the case inconsistent
with the theory it had advanced  [*178]  in Stumpf's case.  We granted
certiorari to review both holdings.   543 U.S. ___, 543 U.S. 1042, 160 L. Ed. 2d
610, 125 S. Ct. 824 (2005).

I

On May 14, 1984, Stumpf and two other men, Clyde Daniel Wesley and Norman Leroy
Edmonds, were traveling in Edmonds' car along Interstate 70 through Guernsey
County, Ohio.  Needing money for gas, the men stopped the car along the highway.
While Edmonds waited in the car, Stumpf and Wesley walked to the home of Norman
and Mary Jane Stout, about 100 yards away.  Stumpf and Wesley, each concealing a
gun, talked their way into the home by telling the Stouts they needed to use the
phone.  Their real object, however, was robbery: Once inside, Stumpf held the
Stouts at gunpoint, while Wesley ransacked the house.  When Mr. Stout moved
toward Stumpf, Stumpf shot him twice in the head, causing Mr. Stout to black
out.  After he regained consciousness, Mr. Stout heard two male voices coming
from another room, and then four gunshots--the shots that killed his wife.
Edmonds was arrested shortly afterward, and his statements led the police to
issue [**2403]  arrest warrants for Stumpf and Wesley.  Stumpf, who surrendered
to the police, at first denied any knowledge of the crimes.  After he was told
that Mr. Stout had survived,  however, Stumpf admitted to participating in the
robbery and to shooting Mr. Stumpf.  But he claimed not to have shot Mrs. Stout,
and he has maintained that position ever since.

The proceedings against Stumpf occurred while Wesley, who had been arrested in
Texas, was still resisting extradition to Ohio.  Stumpf was indicted for
aggravated murder, attempted aggravated murder, aggravated robbery, and two
counts of grand theft.  With respect to the aggravated murder charge, the
indictment listed four statutory ""specifications""--three of them aggravating
circumstances making Stumpf eligible for the death penalty. See App. 117-118;
[*179]  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 2929.03 (Anderson 1982). * The case was assigned
to a three-judge panel in the Court of Common Pleas.

Rather than proceed to trial, however, Stumpf and the State worked out a plea
agreement: Stumpf would plead guilty to aggravated murder and attempted
aggravated murder, and the State would drop most of the other charges; with
respect to the aggravated murder charge, Stumpf would plead guilty to one of the
three capital specifications, with the State dropping the other two.  The plea
was accepted after a colloquy with the presiding judge, and after a hearing in
which the panel satisfied itself as to the factual basis for the plea.

Because the capital specification to which Stumpf pleaded guilty left him
eligible for the death penalty, a contested penalty hearing was held before the
same three-judge panel.  Stumpf's mitigation case was based in part on his
difficult childhood, limited education, dependable work history, youth, and lack
of prior serious offenses.  Stumpf's principal argument, however, was that he
had participated in the plot only at the urging and under the influence of
Wesley, that it was Wesley who had fired the fatal shots at Mrs. Stout, and that
Stumpf's assertedly minor role in the murder counseled against the death
sentence. See § 2929.04(B)(6) (directing the sentencer to consider as a
potential mitigating circumstance, ""[i]f the offender was a participant in the
offense but not the principal offender, the degree of the offender's
participation in the offense"").  The State, on the other hand, argued that
Stumpf had indeed shot Mrs. Stout.  Still, while the prosecutor claimed Stumpf's
allegedly primary role in the shooting as a special reason to reject Stumpf's
mitigation argument, the prosecutor also noted that Ohio law did not restrict
the death penalty to those who commit murder by their own hands--an accomplice
to murder could also receive  [*180]  the death penalty, so long as he acted
with the specific intent to cause death. As a result, the State argued, Stumpf
deserved death even if he had not personally shot Mrs. Stout, because the
circumstances of the robbery provided a basis from which to infer Stumpf's
intent to cause death. The three-judge panel, agreeing with the State's first
contention, specifically found that Stumpf ""was the principal offender"" in the
aggravated murder of Mrs. Stout. App. 196.  Determining that the aggravating
factors in Stumpf's case outweighed any mitigating factors, the panel sentenced
Stumpf to death.

Afterward, Wesley was successfully extradited to Ohio to stand trial.  His case
was tried to a jury, before the same judge  [**2404]  who had presided over the
panel overseeing Stumpf's proceedings, and with the same prosecutor. This time,
however, the prosecutor had new evidence: James Eastman, Wesley's cellmate after
his extradition, testified that Wesley had admitted to firing the shots that
killed Mrs. Stout.  The prosecutor introduced Eastman's testimony in Wesley's
trial, and in his closing argument he argued for Wesley's credibility and lack
of motive to lie.  The prosecutor claimed that Eastman's testimony, combined
with certain circumstantial evidence and with the implausibility of Wesley's
[***152]  own account of events, proved that Wesley was the principal offender
in Mrs. Stout's murder--and that Wesley therefore deserved to be put to death.
One way Wesley countered this argument was by noting that the prosecutor had
taken a contrary position in Stumpf's trial, and that Stumpf had already been
sentenced to death for the crime.  Wesley also took the stand in his own
defense, and testified that Stumpf had shot Mrs. Stout.  In the end, the jury
sentenced Wesley to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after 20
years.

After the Wesley trial, Stumpf, whose direct appeal was still pending in the
Ohio Court of Appeals, returned to the Court of Common Pleas with a motion to
withdraw his guilty plea or vacate his death sentence. Stumpf argued that
[*181]  Eastman's testimony, and the prosecution's endorsement of that testimony
in Wesley's trial, cast doubt upon Stumpf's conviction and sentence. The State
(represented again by the same prosecutor who had tried both Wesley's case and
Stumpf's original case) disagreed.  According to the prosecutor, the court's
first task was to decide whether the Eastman testimony was sufficient to alter
the court's prior determination that Stumpf had been the shooter. Id., at 210.
Contrary to the argument he had presented in the Wesley trial, however, the
prosecutor now noted that Eastman's testimony was belied by certain other
evidence (ballistics evidence and Wesley's testimony in his own defense)
confirming Stumpf to have been the primary shooter. In the alternative, the
State noted as it had before that an aider-and-abettor theory might allow the
death sentence to be imposed against Stumpf even if he had not shot Mrs. Stout.

Although one judge speculated during oral argument that the court's earlier
conclusion about Stumpf's principal role in the killing ""may very well have had
an effect upon"" the prior sentencing determination, ibid., the Court of Common
Pleas denied Stumpf's motion in a brief summary order without explanation.  That
order was appealed together with the original judgment in Stumpf's case, and the
Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed, as did the Ohio Supreme Court.   State v.
Stumpf, 32 Ohio St. 3d 95, 512 N.E.2d 598 (1987), cert denied,  484 U.S. 1079,
98 L. Ed. 2d 1022, 108 S. Ct. 1060 (1988).

After a subsequent request for state postconviction relief was denied by the
state courts, Stumpf filed this federal habeas petition in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in November 1995.  The District
Court denied Stumpf relief, but granted permission to appeal on four claims,
including the two at issue here.  The United States Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit reversed, concluding that habeas relief was warranted on ""either
or both"" of ""two alternative grounds.""  Stumpf v. Mitchell, 367 F.3d 594, 596
(2004).  First, the court determined that Stumpf's  [*182]  guilty plea was
invalid because it had not been entered knowingly and intelligently.  More
precisely, the court concluded that Stumpf had pleaded guilty to aggravated
murder without understanding that specific intent to cause death was a necessary
element of the [**2405]  charge under Ohio law.  See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §
2903.01(B) and (D).  Noting that Stumpf had all along denied shooting Mrs.
Stout, and considering  [***153]  those denials inconsistent with an informed
choice to plead guilty to aggravated murder, the Court of Appeals concluded that
Stumpf must have entered his plea out of ignorance.  Second, the court concluded
that ""Stumpf's due process rights were violated by the state's deliberate action
in securing convictions of both Stumpf and Wesley for the same crime, using
inconsistent theories.""  367 F.3d at 596.  This violation, the court held,
required setting aside ""both Stumpf's plea and his sentence.""  Id., at 616.  One
member of the panel dissented.

[***LEdHR4] [4] Because Stumpf filed his habeas petition before enactment of the
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), we review his
claims under the standards of the pre-AEDPA habeas statute.  See  Lindh v.
Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 138 L. Ed. 2d 481, 117 S. Ct. 2059 (1997).  Moreover,
because petitioner has not argued that Stumpf's habeas claims were barred as
requiring announcement of a new rule, we do not apply the rule of  Teague v.
Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 103 L. Ed. 2d 334, 109 S. Ct. 1060 (1989), to this case.
See  Schiro v. Farley, 510 U.S. 222, 229, 127 L. Ed. 2d 47, 114 S. Ct. 783
(1994);  Godinez v. Moran, 509 U.S. 389, 397, n. 8, 125 L. Ed. 2d 321, 113 S.
Ct. 2680 (1993).

A

[***LEdHR1A] [1B] The Court of Appeals concluded that Stumpf's plea of guilty to
aggravated murder was invalid because he was not aware of the specific intent
element of the charge--a determination we find unsupportable.

[***LEdHR5A] [5A] Stumpf's guilty plea would indeed be invalid if he had not
been aware of the nature of the charges against him, including  [*183]  the
elements of the aggravated murder charge to which he pleaded guilty.  [HN1] A
guilty plea operates as a waiver of important rights, and is valid only if done
voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently, ""with sufficient awareness of the
relevant circumstances and likely consequences.""  Brady v. United States, 397
U.S. 742, 748, 25 L. Ed. 2d 747, 90 S. Ct. 1463 (1970).  Where a defendant
pleads guilty to a crime without having been informed of the crime's elements,
this standard is not met and the plea is invalid.  Henderson v. Morgan, 426 U.S.
637, 49 L. Ed. 2d 108, 96 S. Ct. 2253 (1976).

[***LEdHR1A] [1C]  [***LEdHR5A] [5B]  [***LEdHR6] [6] But the Court of Appeals
erred in finding that Stumpf had not been properly informed before pleading
guilty.  In Stumpf's plea hearing, his attorneys represented on the record that
they had explained to their client the elements of the aggravated murder charge;
Stumpf himself then confirmed that this representation was true.  See App. 135,
137-138.   [HN2] While the court taking a defendant's plea is responsible for
ensuring ""a record adequate for any review that may be later sought,""  Boykin v.
Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 244, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274, 89 S. Ct. 1709 (1969), we have
never held that the judge must himself explain the elements of each charge to
the defendant on the record.  Rather, the constitutional prerequisites of a
valid plea may be satisfied where the record accurately reflects that the nature
of the charge and the elements of the crime were explained to the defendant by
his own, competent counsel.  Cf.  Henderson, supra, at 647, 49 L. Ed. 2d 108, 96
S. Ct. 2253 [***154]  (granting relief to a defendant unaware of the elements of
his crime, but distinguishing that case from others where ""the record contains
either an explanation of the charge by the trial judge, or at least a
representation by defense counsel that the [**2406]  nature of the offense has
been explained to the accused"").   [HN3] Where a defendant is represented by
competent counsel, the court usually may rely on that counsel's assurance that
the defendant has been properly informed of the nature and elements of the
charge to which he is pleading guilty.

[***LEdHR1A] [1D]  [***LEdHR7] [7] Seeking to counter this natural inference,
Stumpf argues, in essence, that his choice to plead guilty to the aggravated
[*184]  murder charge was so inconsistent with his denial of having shot the
victim that he could only have pleaded guilty out of ignorance of the charge's
specific intent requirement.  But Stumpf's asserted inconsistency is illusory.
The aggravated murder charge's intent element did not require any showing that
Stumpf had himself shot Mrs. Stout.  Rather,  [HN4] Ohio law considers aiders
and abettors equally in violation of the aggravated murder statute, so long as
the aiding and abetting is done with the specific intent to cause death. See  In
re Washington, 81 Ohio St. 3d 337, 1998 Ohio 627, 691 N.E.2d 285 (1998);  State
v. Scott, 61 Ohio St. 2d 155, 165, 400 N.E.2d 375, 382 (1980).  As a result,
Stumpf's steadfast assertion that he had not shot Mrs. Stout would not
necessarily have precluded him from admitting his specific intent under the
statute.

[***LEdHR1A] [1E] That is particularly so given the other evidence in this case.
Stumpf and Wesley had gone to the Stouts' home together, carrying guns and
intending to commit armed robbery. Stumpf, by his own admission, shot Mr. Stout
in the head at close range.  Taken together, these facts could show that Wesley
and Stumpf had together agreed to kill both of the Stouts in order to leave no
witnesses to the crime.  And that, in turn, could make both men guilty of
aggravated murder regardless of who actually killed Mrs. Stout.  See ibid., at
165,  400 N. E. 2d, at 382.

Stumpf also points to aspects of the plea hearing transcript which he says show
that both he and his attorneys were confused about the relevance and timing of
defenses Stumpf and his attorneys had planned to make.  First, at one point
during the hearing, the presiding judge stated that by pleading guilty Stumpf
would waive his trial rights and his right to testify in his own behalf.
Stumpf's attorney answered that Stumpf ""was going to respond but we have
informed him that there is, after the plea, a hearing or trial relative to the
underlying facts so that he is of the belief that there will be a presentation
of evidence."" App. 140.  The presiding judge responded that ""[o]f course in the
sentencing portion of this trial you do have those rights to speak in your own
[*185]  behalf [and] to present evidence and testimony on your own behalf.""
Ibid. A few moments later, there was another exchange along similar lines, after
the judge asked Stumpf whether he was ""in fact guilty of"" the aggravated murder
charge and its capital specification:


     ""[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: . . . Your Honor, the defendant has asked me to
     explain his answer.  His answer is yes.  He will recite that with
     obviously his understanding of his right to present evidence at a
     later time relative to  [***155]  his conduct, but he'll respond to
     that.

     ""JUDGE HENDERSON: At no time am I implying that the defendant will not
     have the right to present evidence in [the] mitigation hearing . . . .
     And I'm going to ask that the defendant, himself, respond to the
     question that I asked with that understanding that he has the right to
     present evidence in mitigation. I'm going to ask the defendant if he
     is in fact guilty of the charge set forth in Count one, including
     specification one . . .?

     ""THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir."" Id., at 142.



 [**2407]  Reviewing this exchange, the Court of Appeals concluded that Stumpf
""obviously . . . was reiterating his desire to challenge the [S]tate's account
of his actions""--that is, to show that he did not intend to kill Mrs. Stout.
367 F.3d at 607.  But the desire to contest the State's version of events would
not necessarily entail the desire to contest the aggravated murder charge or any
of its elements.  Rather, Stumpf's desire to put on evidence ""relative to the
underlying facts"" and ""relative to his conduct"" could equally have meant that
Stumpf was eager to make his mitigation case--an interpretation bolstered by the
attorney's and Stumpf's approving answers after the presiding judge confirmed
that the defense could put on evidence ""in mitigation"" and in ""the sentencing""
phase.  While Stumpf's mitigation case was premised on the argument that Stumpf
had not shot Mrs. Stout, that was  [*186]  fully consistent with his plea of
guilty to aggravated murder. See supra, ___ - ___, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 154.

[***LEdHR1A] [1F]  [***LEdHR8] [8] Finally, Stumpf, like the Court of Appeals,
relies on the perception that he obtained a bad bargain by his plea--that the
State's dropping several non-murder charges and two of the three capital murder
specifications was a bad tradeoff for Stumpf's guilty plea. But  [HN5] a plea's
validity may not be collaterally attacked merely because the defendant made what
turned out, in retrospect, to be a poor deal.  See  Brady, 397 U.S., at 757, 25
L. Ed. 2d 747, 90 S. Ct. 1463;  Mabry v. Johnson, 467 U.S. 504, 508, 81 L. Ed.
2d 437, 104 S. Ct. 2543 (1984).  Rather, the shortcomings of the deal Stumpf
obtained cast doubt on the validity of his plea only if they show either that he
made the unfavorable plea on the constitutionally defective advice of counsel,
see  Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 267, 36 L. Ed. 2d 235, 93 S. Ct. 1602
(1973), or that he could not have understood the terms of the bargain he and
Ohio agreed to.  Though Stumpf did bring an independent claim asserting
ineffective assistance of counsel, that claim is not before us in this case.
And in evaluating the validity of Stumpf's plea, we are reluctant to accord much
weight to his post hoc reevaluation of the wisdom of the bargain.  Stumpf
pleaded guilty knowing that the State had copious evidence against him,
including the testimony of Mr. Stout; the plea eliminated two of the three
capital specifications the State could rely on in seeking the death penalty; and
the plea allowed Stumpf to assert his acceptance of responsibility as an
argument in mitigation. Under these circumstances, the plea may well have been a
knowing, voluntary, and intelligent reaction to a litigation situation that was
difficult, to say the least.  The Court of Appeals  [***156]  erred in
concluding that Stumpf was uninformed about the nature of the charge he pleaded
guilty to, and we reverse that portion of the judgment below.

B

[***LEdHR2A] [2B] The Court of Appeals was also wrong to hold that prosecutorial
inconsistencies between the Stumpf and Wesley cases  [*187]  required voiding
Stumpf's guilty plea. Stumpf's assertions of inconsistency relate entirely to
the prosecutor's arguments about which of the two men, Wesley or Stumpf, shot
Mrs. Stout.  For the reasons given above, see supra, at ____ - ____, 162 L. Ed.
2d, at 154, the precise identity of the triggerman was immaterial to Stumpf's
conviction for aggravated murder. Moreover, Stumpf has never provided an
explanation of how the prosecution's postplea use of inconsistent arguments
could have affected the knowing, voluntary, and intelligent nature of his plea.

[***LEdHR3A] [3B] The prosecutor's use of allegedly inconsistent theories may
have a more direct effect on Stumpf's sentence, however, for it is at least
arguable that the sentencing [**2408]  panel's conclusion about Stumpf's
principal role in the offense was material to its sentencing determination. The
opinion below leaves some ambiguity as to the overlap between how the lower
court resolved Stumpf's due process challenge to his conviction, and how it
resolved Stumpf's challenge to his sentence. It is not clear whether the Court
of Appeals would have concluded that Stumpf was entitled to resentencing had the
court not also considered the conviction invalid. Likewise, the parties'
briefing to this Court, and the question on which we granted certiorari, largely
focused on the lower court's determination about Stumpf's conviction.  See,
e.g., Pet. for Cert. ii (requesting review of Stumpf's conviction, not
sentence); Reply Brief for Petitioner 3 (challenge to Court of Appeals' decision
is focused on issue of conviction); Brief for Respondent 15, n 3 (""arguments
regarding Stumpf's death sentence are not before this Court"").  In these
circumstances, it would be premature for this Court to resolve the merits of
Stumpf's sentencing claim, and we therefore express no opinion on whether the
prosecutor's actions amounted to a due process violation, or whether any such
violation would have been prejudicial.  The Court of Appeals should have the
opportunity to consider, in the first instance, the question of how Eastman's
testimony and the  [*188]  prosecutor's conduct in the Stumpf and Wesley cases
relate to Stumpf's death sentence in particular.  Accordingly, we vacate the
portion of the judgment below relating to Stumpf's prosecutorial inconsistency
claim, and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.

It is so ordered.

CONCUR BY: SOUTER

Justice Souter, joined by Justice Ginsburg, concurring.

I join the opinion of the Court and add this word to explain the issue that I
understand we are remanding for further consideration.  As the Court notes in
its opinion, although respondent John Stumpf challenged  [***157]  both his
conviction and his death sentence, his attack on the sentence was not always
distinct from the issue raised about the conviction.

I understand Stumpf to claim that it violates the basic due process standard,
barring fundamentally unfair procedure, to allow his death sentence to stand in
the aftermath of three positions taken by the State: (1) at Stumpf's sentencing
hearing; (2) at the trial of Stumpf's codefendant, Clyde Wesley; and (3) in
response to Stumpf's motion to withdraw his guilty plea in light of the State's
position at the Wesley trial.  At the hearing on Stumpf's sentence, the State
argued that he was the triggerman, and it urged consideration of that fact as a
reason to impose a death sentence. App. 186, 188-189.  The trial court found
that Stumpf had pulled the trigger and did sentence him to death, though it did
not state that finding Stumpf to be the shooter was dispositive in determining
the sentence. App. to Pet. for Cert. 219a.  After the sentencing proceeding was
over, the State tried the codefendant, Wesley, and on the basis of testimony
from a new witness argued that Wesley was in fact the triggerman, App. 282, and
should be sentenced to death. The new witness was apparently unconvincing to the
jury, which in any event was informed that Stumpf had already been sentenced to
death for the crime; the jury rejected the specification that named Wesley as
the  [*189]  triggerman, and it recommended a sentence of life, not death.
Stumpf then challenged his death sentence (along with his conviction)  on the
basis of the prosecution's position in the Wesley case.  In response, the State
did not repudiate the position it had taken in the codefendant's case, or
explain that it had made a mistake [**2409]  there.  Instead, it merely
dismissed the testimony of the witness it had vouched for at Wesley's trial, id.
, at 125, and maintained that Stumpf's death sentence should stand for some or
all of the reasons it originally argued for its imposition.  At the end of the
day, the State was on record as maintaining that Stumpf and Wesley should both
be executed on the ground that each was the trigger-man, when it was undisputed
that only one of them could have been.

Stumpf's claim as I understand it is not a challenge to the evidentiary basis
for arguing for the death penalty in either case; nor is it a claim that the
prosecution deliberately deceived or attempted to deceive either trial court, as
in  Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103, 79 L. Ed. 791, 55 S. Ct. 340 (1935) (per
curiam); nor does it implicate the rule that inconsistent jury verdicts may be
enforced,  United States v. Powell, 469 U.S. 57, 83 L. Ed. 2d 461, 105 S. Ct.
471 (1984);  Dunn v. United States, 284 U.S. 390, 76 L. Ed. 356, 52 S. Ct. 189
(1932).  As I see it, Stumpf's argument is simply that a death sentence may not
be allowed to stand when it was imposed in response to a factual claim that the
State necessarily contradicted in subsequently arguing for a death sentence in
the case of a codefendant. Stumpf's position was anticipated by Justice
Stevens's observation 10 years ago that ""serious questions are raised when the
sovereign itself takes inconsistent positions in two separate criminal
proceedings against two of its citizens,"" and that ""the heightened need for
reliability in capital cases only underscores the gravity of those questions . .
. .""  Jacobs  [***158]  v. Scott, 513 U.S. 1067, 1070, 130 L. Ed. 2d 618, 115 S.
Ct. 711 (1995) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Justice
Stevens's statement in turn echoed the more general one expressed by Justice
Sutherland in  Berger v. United States,  [*190]  295 U.S. 78, 88, 79 L. Ed.
1314, 55 S. Ct. 629 (1935), that the State's interest in winning some point in a
given case is transcended by its interest ""that justice shall be done.""
Ultimately, Stumpf's argument appears to be that sustaining a death sentence in
circumstances like those here results in a sentencing system that invites the
death penalty ""to be . . .  wantonly and . . . freakishly imposed.""  Lewis v.
Jeffers, 497 U.S. 764, 774, 111 L. Ed. 2d 606, 110 S. Ct. 3092 (1990) (quoting
Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 188, 49 L. Ed. 2d 859, 96 S. Ct. 2909 (1976)
(joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.); internal quotation marks
omitted).

If a due process violation is found in the State's maintenance of such
inconsistent positions, there will be remedial questions.  May the death
sentence stand if the State declines to repudiate its inconsistent position in
the codefendant's case?  Would it be sufficient simply to reexamine the original
sentence and if so, which party should have the burden of persuasion?  If more
would be required, would a de novo sentencing hearing suffice?

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins, concurring.

I join the Court's opinion.  As the Court notes, the State has not argued that
Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 103 L. Ed. 2d 334, 109 S. Ct. 1060 (1989),
forecloses Stumpf's claim that the prosecution's presentation of inconsistent
theories violated his right to due process.   Ante, at ____, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at
153.  With certain narrow exceptions, Teague precludes federal courts from
granting habeas petitioners relief on the basis of ""new"" rules of constitutional
law established after their convictions become final.   489 U.S., at 310, 103 L.
Ed. 334, 109 S. Ct. 1060 (plurality opinion).  This Court has never hinted, much
less held, that the Due Process Clause prevents a State from prosecuting
defendants based on inconsistent theories.  [**2410]  Moreover, it is ""[a]
threshold question in every habeas case . . . whether the court is obligated to
apply the Teague rule to the defendant's claim,"" and ""if the State does argue
[*191]  that the defendant seeks the benefit of a new rule of constitutional
law, the court must apply Teague before considering the merits of the claim.""
Horn v. Banks, 536 U.S. 266, 271, 153 L. Ed. 2d 301, 122 S. Ct. 2147 (2002) (per
curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The State also has not argued that
Stumpf procedurally defaulted his due process claim, even though it appears that
Stumpf never presented this argument to the Ohio courts.  Stumpf did not even
raise the inconsistent-theories claim in his first federal habeas filings.  See
App. to Pet. for Cert. 134a-140a.  Instead, the District Court raised the issue
for Stumpf sua sponte, and ordered supplemental briefing on the point.  See App.
97-98.  The Court's opinion does not preclude the State from advancing either of
these procedural defenses on remand in support of Stumpf's death sentence.

Moreover, I agree with the Court that ""Stumpf has never provided an explanation
of how the prosecution's  [***159]  postplea use of inconsistent arguments could
have affected the knowing, voluntary, and intelligent nature of his plea.""  Ante
, at ____, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 156.  Similar reasoning ap"

 [*549]  [**2615]    Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A] These consolidated cases present the question whether a
federal court in a diversity action may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over
additional plaintiffs whose claims do not satisfy the minimum
amount-in-controversy requirement, provided the claims are part of the same case
or controversy as the claims of plaintiffs who do allege a  [***515]  sufficient
amount in controversy.  Our decision turns on the correct interpretation of 28
U.S.C. § 1367.  The question has divided the Courts of Appeals, and we granted
certiorari to resolve the conflict. 543 U.S. 924, 160 L. Ed. 2d 221, 125 S. Ct.
317 (2004).

We hold that,  [HN1] where the other elements of jurisdiction are present and at
least one named plaintiff in the action satisfies the amount-in-controversy
requirement, § 1367 does authorize supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of
other plaintiffs in the same Article III case or controversy, even if those
claims are for less than the jurisdictional amount specified in the statute
setting forth the requirements for diversity jurisdiction. We affirm  [*550]
the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in No. 04-70, and
we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in No.
04-79.

In 1991, about 10,000 Exxon dealers filed a class-action suit against the Exxon
Corporation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Florida.  The dealers alleged an intentional and systematic scheme by Exxon
under which they were overcharged for fuel purchased from Exxon.  The plaintiffs
invoked the District Court's § 1332(a) diversity jurisdiction. After a unanimous
jury verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, the District Court certified the case
for interlocutory review, asking whether it had properly exercised § 1367
supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of class members who did not meet the
jurisdictional minimum amount in controversy.

[**2616]  The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld the District
Court's extension of supplemental jurisdiction to these class members.
Allapattah Services, Inc. v. Exxon Corp., 333 F.3d 1248 (2003).  ""[W]e find,""
the court held, ""that § 1367 clearly and unambiguously provides district courts
with the authority in diversity class actions to exercise supplemental
jurisdiction over the claims of class members who do not meet the minimum amount
in controversy as long as the district court has original jurisdiction over the
claims of at least one of the class representatives.""  Id., at 1256.  This
decision accords with the views of the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Sixth,
and Seventh Circuits.  See  Rosmer v. Pfizer, Inc., 263 F.3d 110 (CA4 2001);
Olden v. LaFarge Corp., 383 F.3d 495 (CA6 2004);  Stromberg Metal Works, Inc. v.
Press Mechanical, Inc., 77 F.3d 928 (CA7 1996); In re Brand Name Prescription
Drugs Antitrust Litigation, 123 F.3d 599 (CA7 1997).  The Courts of Appeals for
the Fifth and Ninth Circuits, adopting a similar analysis of the statute, have
held that in a diversity class action the unnamed class members need not meet
the amount-in-controversy requirement, provided the named class members  [*551]
do.  These decisions, however, are unclear on whether all the named plaintiffs
must satisfy this requirement.  Free v. Abbott Lab. (In re Abbott Lab.), 51 F.3d
524 (CA5 1995);  Gibson v. Chrysler Corp., 261 F.3d 927 (CA9 2001).

In the other case now before us the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit took
a different position on the meaning of § 1367(a).  370 F.3d 124 (2004).  In that
case, a 9-year-old girl sued Star-Kist in a diversity action in the United
States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, seeking damages for
unusually severe injuries  [***516]  she received when she sliced her finger on
a tuna can.  Her family joined in the suit, seeking damages for emotional
distress and certain medical expenses.  The District Court granted summary
judgment to Star-Kist, finding that none of the plaintiffs met the minimum
amount-in-controversy requirement.  The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit,
however, ruled that the injured girl, but not her family members, had made
allegations of damages in the requisite amount.

The Court of Appeals then addressed whether, in light of the fact that one
plaintiff met the requirements for original jurisdiction, supplemental
jurisdiction over the remaining plaintiffs' claims was proper under § 1367.  The
court held that § 1367 authorizes supplemental jurisdiction only when the
district court has original jurisdiction over the action, and that in a
diversity case original jurisdiction is lacking if one plaintiff fails to
satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement.  Although the Court of Appeals
claimed to ""express no view"" on whether the result would be the same in a class
action, id., at 143, n. 19, its analysis is inconsistent with that of the Court
of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.  The Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit's view of § 1367 is, however, shared by the Courts of Appeals for the
Third, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits, and the latter two Courts of Appeals have
expressly applied this rule to class actions.  See  Meritcare, Inc. v. St. Paul
Mercury Ins. Co., 166 F.3d 214 (CA3 1999); Trimble v. Asarco, Inc., 232 F.3d 946
(CA8  [*552]  2000); Leonhardt v. Western Sugar Co., 160 F.3d 631 (CA10 1998).

[***LEdHR5A] [5A] The district courts of the United States, as we have said many
times, are ""courts of limited jurisdiction.  They possess only that power
authorized by Constitution and statute,""  [**2617]   Kokkonen v. Guardian Life
Ins. Co. of America, 511 U.S. 375, 377, 128 L. Ed. 2d 391, 114 S. Ct. 1673
(1994).   [HN3] In order to provide a federal forum for plaintiffs who seek to
vindicate federal rights, Congress has conferred on the district courts original
jurisdiction in federal-question cases --civil actions that arise under the
Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.  28 U.S.C. § 1331.   [HN4]
In order to provide a neutral forum for what have come to be known as diversity
cases, Congress also has granted district courts original jurisdiction in civil
actions between citizens of different States, between U.S. citizens and foreign
citizens, or by foreign states against U.S. citizens. § 1332.  To ensure that
diversity jurisdiction does not flood the federal courts with minor disputes, §
1332(a) requires that the matter in controversy in a diversity case exceed a
specified amount, currently $75,000.

[HN5]  [***LEdHR2A] [2B]  [***LEdHR6A] [6A] Although the district courts may not
exercise jurisdiction absent a statutory basis, it is well established--in
certain classes of cases--that, once a court has original jurisdiction over some
claims in the action, it may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over additional
claims that are part of the same case or controversy.  The leading modern case
for this principle is Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218, 86
S. Ct. 1130 (1966).  In Gibbs, the plaintiff alleged the defendant's  [***517]
conduct violated both federal and state law.  The District Court, Gibbs held,
had original jurisdiction over the action based on the federal claims.  Gibbs
confirmed that  [HN6] the District Court had the additional power (though not
the obligation) to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over related state claims
that arose from  [*553]  the same Article III case or controversy.  Id., at 725,
16 L. Ed. 2d 218, 86 S. Ct. 1130 (""The federal claim must have substance
sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the court.  . . .
[A]ssuming substantiality of the federal issues, there is power in federal
courts to hear the whole"").

[***LEdHR6A] [6B] As we later noted, the decision allowing jurisdiction over
pendent state claims in Gibbs did not mention, let alone come to grips with, the
text of the jurisdictional statutes and the bedrock principle that federal
courts have no jurisdiction without statutory authorization.  Finley v. United
States, 490 U.S. 545, 548, 104 L. Ed. 2d 593, 109 S. Ct. 2003 (1989).  In Finley
, we nonetheless reaffirmed and rationalized Gibbs and its progeny by inferring
from it the interpretive principle that,  [HN7] in cases involving supplemental
jurisdiction over additional claims between parties properly in federal court,
the jurisdictional statutes should be read broadly, on the assumption that in
this context Congress intended to authorize courts to exercise their full
Article III power to dispose of an ""'entire action before the court [which]
comprises but one constitutional ""case.""'""  490 U.S., at 549, 104 L. Ed. 2d 593,
109 S. Ct. 2003 (quoting Gibbs, supra, at 725, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218, 86 S. Ct. 1130
).

We have not, however, applied Gibbs' expansive interpretive approach to other
aspects of the jurisdictional statutes.  For instance,  [HN8] we have
consistently interpreted § 1332 as requiring complete diversity: In a case with
multiple plaintiffs and multiple defendants, the presence in the action of a
single plaintiff from the same State as a single defendant deprives the district
court of original diversity jurisdiction over the entire action.  Strawbridge v.
Curtiss, 7 U.S. 267, 3 Cranch 267, 2 L. Ed. 435 (1806); Owen Equipment &
Erection Co. v. Kroger, 437 U.S. 365, 375, 57 L. Ed. 2d 274, 98 S. Ct. 2396
(1978).  The complete diversity requirement is not mandated by the Constitution,
State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Tashire, 386 U.S. 523, 530-531, 18 L. Ed. 2d
270, 87 S. Ct. 1199 (1967), or by the plain text of § 1332(a).  The Court,
nonetheless, has adhered to the complete diversity [**2618]  rule in light of
the purpose of the diversity requirement, which is to provide a federal forum
for important disputes where state courts might favor, or be  [*554]  perceived
as favoring, home-state litigants.  The presence of parties from the same State
on both sides of a case dispels this concern, eliminating a principal reason for
conferring § 1332 jurisdiction over any of the claims in the action.  See
Wisconsin Dept. of Corrections v. Schacht, 524 U.S. 381, 389, 141 L. Ed. 2d 364,
118 S. Ct. 2047 (1998); Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain, 490 U.S. 826,
829, 104 L. Ed. 2d 893, 109 S. Ct. 2218 (1989).  The specific purpose of the
complete diversity rule explains both why we have not adopted Gibbs' expansive
interpretive approach to this aspect of the jurisdictional statute and why Gibbs
does not undermine the complete diversity rule.   [HN9] In order for a federal
court to invoke supplemental jurisdiction under  [***518]  Gibbs, it must first
have original jurisdiction over at least one claim in the action.  Incomplete
diversity destroys original jurisdiction with respect to all claims, so there is
nothing to which supplemental jurisdiction can adhere.

[HN10] In contrast to the diversity requirement, most of the other statutory
prerequisites for federal jurisdiction, including the federal-question and
amount-in-controversy requirements, can be analyzed claim by claim.  True, it
does not follow by necessity from this that a district court has authority to
exercise supplemental jurisdiction over all claims provided there is original
jurisdiction over just one.  Before the enactment of § 1367, the Court declined
in contexts other than the pendent-claim instance to follow Gibbs' expansive
approach to interpretation of the jurisdictional statutes.  The Court took a
more restrictive view of the proper interpretation of these statutes in
so-called pendent-party cases involving supplemental jurisdiction over claims
involving additional parties--plaintiffs or defendants--where the district
courts would lack original jurisdiction over claims by each of the parties
standing alone.

Thus, with respect to plaintiff-specific jurisdictional requirements, the Court
held in Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., 306 U.S. 583, 83 L. Ed. 1001, 59 S. Ct. 744
(1939), that every plaintiff must separately satisfy the amount-in-controversy
requirement.  Though Clark was  [*555]  a federal-question case, at that time
federal-question jurisdiction had an amount-in-controversy requirement analogous
to the amount-in-controversy requirement for diversity cases.  ""Proper
practice,"" Clark held, ""requires that where each of several plaintiffs is bound
to establish the jurisdictional amount with respect to his own claim, the suit
should be dismissed as to those who fail to show that the requisite amount is
involved.""  Id., at 590, 83 L. Ed. 1001, 59 S. Ct. 744.  The Court reaffirmed
this rule, in the context of a class action brought invoking § 1332(a) diversity
jurisdiction, in Zahn v. International Paper Co., 414 U.S. 291, 38 L. Ed. 2d
511, 94 S. Ct. 505 (1973).  It follows ""inescapably"" from Clark, the Court held
in Zahn, that ""any plaintiff without the jurisdictional amount must be dismissed
from the case, even though others allege jurisdictionally sufficient claims.""
414 U.S., at 300, 38 L. Ed. 2d 511, 94 S. Ct. 505.

The Court took a similar approach with respect to supplemental jurisdiction over
claims against additional defendants that fall outside the district courts'
original jurisdiction. In Aldinger v. Howard, 427 U.S. 1, 49 L. Ed. 2d 276, 96
S. Ct. 2413 (1976), the plaintiff brought a Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983,
action against county officials in District Court pursuant to the statutory
grant of jurisdiction in 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) (1976 ed.).  The plaintiff
further alleged the court had supplemental jurisdiction over her related
state-law  [**2619] claims against the county, even though the county was not
suable under § 1983 and so was not subject to § 1343(a)(3)'s original
jurisdiction. The Court held that supplemental jurisdiction could not be
exercised because Congress, in enacting § 1343(a)(3), had declined (albeit
implicitly) to extend federal jurisdiction over any party who could not be sued
under the federal civil rights statutes.  427 U.S., at 16-19, 49 L. Ed. 2d 276,
96 S. Ct. 2413.  ""Before it can be concluded that  [***519]  [supplemental]
jurisdiction [over additional parties] exists,"" Aldinger held, ""a federal court
must satisfy itself not only that Art[icle] III permits it, but that Congress in
the statutes conferring jurisdiction has not expressly or by implication negated
its existence.""  Id., at 18, 49 L. Ed. 2d 276, 96 S. Ct. 2413.

[*556]  In Finley v. United States, 490 U.S. 545, 104 L. Ed. 2d 593, 109 S. Ct.
2003 (1989), we confronted a similar issue in a different statutory context.
The plaintiff in Finley brought a Federal Tort Claims Act negligence suit
against the Federal Aviation Administration in District Court, which had
original jurisdiction under § 1346(b).  The plaintiff tried to add related
claims against other defendants, invoking the District Court's supplemental
jurisdiction over so-called pendent parties.  We held that the District Court
lacked a sufficient statutory basis for exercising supplemental jurisdiction
over these claims.  Relying primarily on Zahn, Aldinger, and Kroger, we held in
Finley that ""a grant of jurisdiction over claims involving particular parties
does not itself confer jurisdiction over additional claims by or against
different parties.""  490 U.S., at 556, 104 L. Ed. 2d 593, 109 S. Ct. 2003.
While Finley did not ""limit or impair"" Gibbs' liberal approach to interpreting
the jurisdictional statutes in the context of supplemental jurisdiction over
additional claims involving the same parties, 490 U.S., at 556, 104 L. Ed. 2d
593, 109 S. Ct. 2003, Finley nevertheless declined to extend that interpretive
assumption to claims involving additional parties.  Finley held that in the
context of parties, in contrast to claims, ""we will not assume that the full
constitutional power has been congressionally authorized, and will not read
jurisdictional statutes broadly.""  Id., at 549, 104 L. Ed. 2d 593, 109 S. Ct.
2003.

As the jurisdictional statutes existed in 1989, then, here is how matters stood:
First, the diversity requirement in § 1332(a) required complete diversity;
absent complete diversity, the district court lacked original jurisdiction over
all of the claims in the action.  Strawbridge, 7 U.S., at 267-268, 3 Cranch, at
267-268, 2 L. Ed. 435; Kroger, 437 U.S., at 373-374, 57 L. Ed. 2d 274, 98 S. Ct.
2396.  Second, if the district court had original jurisdiction over at least one
claim, the jurisdictional statutes implicitly authorized supplemental
jurisdiction over all other claims between the same parties arising out of the
same Article III case or controversy.  Gibbs, 383 U.S., at 725, 16 L. Ed. 2d
218, 86 S. Ct. 1130.  Third, even when the district court had original  [*557]
jurisdiction over one or more claims between particular parties, the
jurisdictional statutes did not authorize supplemental jurisdiction over
additional claims involving other parties.  Clark, 306 U.S., at 590, 83 L. Ed.

In Finley we emphasized that  [HN11] ""[w]hatever we say regarding the scope of
jurisdiction conferred by a particular statute can of course be changed by
Congress.  ""  490 U.S., at 556, 104 L. Ed. 2d 593, 109 S. Ct. 2003.  In 1990,
Congress accepted the invitation.  It passed the Judicial Improvements Act, 104
Stat. 5089, which enacted § 1367, the provision which controls these cases.

[***520]   [***LEdHR1A] [1C]  [***LEdHR6A] [6C] Section 1367 provides, in
relevant part:


      [HN12] ""(a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as
     expressly provided otherwise [**2620]  by Federal statute, in any
     civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction,
     the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all
     other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such
     original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or
     controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.  Such
     supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the
     joinder or intervention of additional parties.  [HN13]

     ""(b) In any civil action of which the district courts have original
     jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332 of this title, the
     district courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under
     subsection (a) over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties
     under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
     or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under
     Rule 19 of such rules, or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under
     Rule 24 of such rules, when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over
     such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements
     of section 1332.""



 [*558]   [***LEdHR1A] [1D]  [***LEdHR6A] [6D]  [***LEdHR7] [7]  [***LEdHR8] [8]
All parties to this litigation and all courts to consider the question agree
that  [HN14] § 1367 overturned the result in Finley. There is no warrant,
however, for assuming that § 1367 did no more than to overrule Finley and
otherwise to codify the existing state of the law of supplemental jurisdiction.
[HN15] We must not give jurisdictional statutes a more expansive interpretation
than their text warrants, 490 U.S., at 549, 556, 104 L. Ed. 2d 593, 109 S. Ct.
2003; but it is just as important not to adopt an artificial construction that
is narrower than what the text provides.  No sound canon of interpretation
requires Congress to speak with extraordinary clarity in order to modify the
rules of federal jurisdiction within appropriate constitutional bounds.
Ordinary principles of statutory construction apply.  In order to determine the
scope of supplemental jurisdiction authorized by § 1367, then, we must examine
the statute's text in light of context, structure, and related statutory
provisions.

[HN16]  [***LEdHR1A] [1E] Section 1367(a) is a broad grant of supplemental
jurisdiction over other claims within the same case or controversy, as long as
the action is one in which the district courts would have original jurisdiction.
The last sentence of § 1367(a) makes it clear that the grant of supplemental
jurisdiction extends to claims involving joinder or intervention of additional
parties.  The single question before us, therefore, is whether a diversity case
in which the claims of some plaintiffs satisfy the amount-in-controversy
requirement, but the claims of other plaintiffs do not, presents a ""civil action
of which the district courts have original jurisdiction."" If the answer is yes,
§ 1367(a) confers supplemental jurisdiction over all claims, including those
that do not independently satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement, if the
claims are part of the same Article III case or controversy.  If the answer is
no, § 1367(a) is inapplicable and, in light of our holdings in Clark and
[***521]  Zahn, the district court has no statutory basis for exercising
supplemental jurisdiction over the additional claims.

[*559]  We now conclude the answer must be yes.   [HN17] When the well-pleaded
complaint contains at least one claim that satisfies the amount-in-controversy
requirement, and there are no other relevant jurisdictional defects, the
district court, beyond all question, has original jurisdiction over that claim.
The presence of other claims in the complaint, over which the district court may
lack original jurisdiction, is of no moment.  If the court has original
jurisdiction over a single claim in the complaint, it has original jurisdiction
over a ""civil action"" [**2621]  within the meaning of § 1367(a), even if the
civil action over which it has jurisdiction comprises fewer claims than were
included in the complaint.  Once the court determines it has original
jurisdiction over the civil action, it can turn to the question whether it has a
constitutional and statutory basis for exercising supplemental jurisdiction over
the other claims in the action.

[HN18] Section 1367(a) commences with the direction that §§ 1367(b) and (c), or
other relevant statutes, may provide specific exceptions, but otherwise §
1367(a) is a broad jurisdictional grant, with no distinction drawn between
pendent-claim and pendent-party cases.  In fact, the last sentence of § 1367(a)
makes clear that the provision grants supplemental jurisdiction over claims
involving joinder or intervention of additional parties.   [HN19] The terms of §
1367 do not acknowledge any distinction between pendent jurisdiction and the
doctrine of so-called ancillary jurisdiction. Though the doctrines of pendent
and ancillary jurisdiction developed separately as a historical matter, the
Court has recognized that the doctrines are ""two species of the same generic
problem,"" Kroger, 437 U.S., at 370, 57 L. Ed. 2d 274, 98 S. Ct. 2396.  Nothing
in § 1367 indicates a congressional intent to recognize, preserve, or create
some meaningful, substantive distinction between the jurisdictional categories
we have historically labeled pendent and ancillary.

[***LEdHR1A] [1F]  [***LEdHR11] [11] If § 1367(a) were the sum total of the
relevant statutory language, our holding would rest on that language alone.
[*560]   [HN20]  The statute, of course, instructs us to examine § 1367(b) to
determine if any of its exceptions apply, so we proceed to that section.  While
§ 1367(b) qualifies the broad rule of § 1367(a), it does not withdraw
supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of the additional parties at issue
here.  The specific exceptions to § 1367(a) contained in § 1367(b), moreover,
provide additional support for our conclusion that § 1367(a) confers
supplemental jurisdiction over these claims.   [HN21] Section 1367(b), which
applies only to diversity cases, withholds supplemental jurisdiction over the
claims of plaintiffs proposed to be joined as indispensable parties under
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19, or who seek to intervene pursuant to Rule 24
.  Nothing in the text of § 1367(b), however, withholds supplemental
jurisdiction over the claims of plaintiffs permissively joined under Rule 20
(like the additional plaintiffs in No. 04-79) or certified as class-action
members pursuant to Rule 23 (like the additional plaintiffs in No. 04-70).  The
natural, indeed the necessary, inference is that § 1367 confers supplemental
jurisdiction over claims by  [***522]  Rule 20 and Rule 23 plaintiffs.  This
inference, at least with respect to Rule 20 plaintiffs, is strengthened by the
fact that § 1367(b) explicitly excludes supplemental jurisdiction over claims
against defendants joined under Rule 20.

[HN22]  [***LEdHR1A] [1G]  [***LEdHR12A] [12A]  [***LEdHR13A] [13A] We cannot
accept the view, urged by some of the parties, commentators, and Courts of
Appeals, that a district court lacks original jurisdiction over a civil action
unless the court has original jurisdiction over every claim in the complaint.
As we understand this position, it requires assuming either that all claims in
the complaint must stand or fall as a single, indivisible ""civil action"" as a
matter of definitional necessity--what we will refer to as the ""indivisibility
theory""--or else that the inclusion of a claim or party falling outside the
district court's original jurisdiction somehow contaminates every other claim in
the complaint, depriving the court of original jurisdiction over any of these
claims--what we will refer to as the ""contamination theory.""

[*561]   [HN23]  [***LEdHR12A] [12B] The indivisibility theory is easily
dismissed, as it is inconsistent with the whole notion of supplemental
jurisdiction. If a [**2622]  district court must have original jurisdiction over
every claim in the complaint in order to have ""original jurisdiction"" over a
""civil action,"" then in Gibbs there was no civil action of which the district
court could assume original jurisdiction under § 1331, and so no basis for
exercising supplemental jurisdiction over any of the claims.  The indivisibility
theory is further belied by our practice--in both federal-question and diversity
cases--of allowing federal courts to cure jurisdictional defects by dismissing
the offending parties rather than dismissing the entire action.  Clark, for
example, makes clear that  [HN24] claims that are jurisdictionally defective as
to amount in controversy do not destroy original jurisdiction over other claims.
306 U.S., at 590, 83 L. Ed. 1001, 59 S. Ct. 744 (dismissing parties who failed
to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement but retaining jurisdiction over
the remaining party).  If the presence of jurisdictionally problematic claims in
the complaint meant the district court was without original jurisdiction over
the single, indivisible civil action before it, then the district court would
have to dismiss the whole action rather than particular parties.

[HN25] We also find it unconvincing to say that the definitional indivisibility
theory applies in the context of diversity cases but not in the context of
federal-question cases.  The broad and general language of the statute does not
permit this result.  The contention is premised on the notion that the phrase
""original jurisdiction of all civil actions"" means different things in § 1331
and  1332.  It is implausible, however, to say that the identical phrase means
one thing (original jurisdiction in all actions where at least one claim in the
complaint meets the following requirements) in § 1331 and something else
(original jurisdiction in all actions where every claim in the complaint meets
the following requirements) in § 1332.

[*562]   [HN26]  [***LEdHR4A] [4B]  [***LEdHR5A] [5B]  [***LEdHR13A] [13B] The
contamination theory, as we have noted, can make some sense in the special
context of the complete diversity requirement because the presence of nondiverse
parties on both sides of a lawsuit eliminates the justification for providing a
federal forum.  The theory,  [***523]  however, makes little sense with respect
to the amount-in-controversy requirement, which is meant to ensure that a
dispute is sufficiently important to warrant federal-court attention.  The
presence of a single nondiverse party may eliminate the fear of bias with
respect to all claims, but the presence of a claim that falls short of the
minimum amount in controversy does nothing to reduce the importance of the
claims that do meet this requirement.

[HN27]  [***LEdHR13A] [13C] It is fallacious to suppose, simply from the
proposition that § 1332 imposes both the diversity requirement and the
amount-in-controversy requirement, that the contamination theory germane to the
former is also relevant to the latter.  There is no inherent logical connection
between the amount-in-controversy requirement and § 1332 diversity jurisdiction.
After all, federal-question jurisdiction once had an amount-in-controversy
requirement as well.  If such a requirement were revived under § 1331, it is
clear beyond peradventure that § 1367(a) provides supplemental jurisdiction over
federal-question cases where some, but not all, of the federal-law claims
involve a sufficient amount in controversy.  In other words, § 1367(a)
unambiguously overrules the holding and the result in Clark If that is so,
however, it would be qui"
"                  ANTONIO DWAYNE HALBERT, Petitioner v. MICHIGAN",545 U.S. 605,"

 [*609]  [**2586]   Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A] In 1994, Michigan voters approved a proposal amending the
State Constitution to provide that ""an appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or
nolo contendere shall be by leave of the court."" Mich. Const., Art. 1, § 20.
Thereafter, ""several Michigan state judges began to deny appointed appellate
counsel to indigents"" convicted by plea.  Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 127,
160 L. Ed. 2d 519, 125 S. Ct. 564 (2004). Rejecting challenges based on the
Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the
Federal Constitution, the Michigan Supreme Court upheld this practice, and its
codification in Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 770.3a (West 2000).  People v. Harris,
470 Mich. 882, 681 N.W.2d 653 (2004); People v. Bulger, 462 Mich. 495, 511, 614
N.W.2d 103, 110 (2000).

Petitioner Antonio Dwayne Halbert, convicted on his plea of nolo contendere,
sought the appointment of counsel to assist him in applying for leave to appeal
to the Michigan Court of Appeals.  The state trial court and the Court of
Appeals denied Halbert's requests for appointed counsel, and the Michigan
Supreme Court declined review.

Michigan Court of Appeals review of an application for leave to appeal, Halbert
contends, ranks as a first-tier appellate proceeding requiring appointment of
counsel under Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 9 L. Ed. 2d 811, 83 S. Ct.
814 (1963).  Michigan urges that appeal to the State Court of Appeals is
discretionary and, for an appeal of that order, Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.S. 600,
41 L. Ed. 2d 341, 94 S. Ct. 2437 (1974), holds counsel need not be appointed.
Earlier this Term, in Kowalski v. Tesmer, this Court, for prudential reasons,
declined to reach the classification question posed by Michigan's system for
appellate review following a plea of guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo
contendere. Today,  [*610]  we reach the classification question and conclude
that Halbert's case is properly ranked with Douglas rather than Ross
Accordingly, we hold that  [HN1] the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses
require the appointment of counsel for defendants, convicted on their pleas, who
seek access to first-tier review in the Michigan Court of Appeals.

[HN2]  [***LEdHR2] [2] The Federal Constitution imposes on the States no
obligation to provide appellate review of criminal  [***560]  convictions.
McKane v. Durston, 153 U.S. 684, 687, 38 L. Ed. 867, 14 S. Ct. 913 (1894).
Having provided such an avenue, however, a State may not ""bolt the door to equal
justice"" to indigent defendants.  Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 24, 100 L.
Ed. 891, 76 S. Ct. 585 (1956) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment); see id.
, at 23, 100 L. Ed. 891, 76 S. Ct. 585  (same) (""[W]hen a State deems it wise
and just that convictions be susceptible to review by an appellate court, it
cannot by force of its exactions draw a line which precludes [**2587]  convicted
indigent persons . . . from securing such . . . review."").  Griffin held that,
when a State conditions an appeal from a conviction on the provision of a trial
transcript, the State must furnish free transcripts to indigent defendants who
seek to appeal.  Id., at 16-20, 100 L. Ed. 2d 891, 76 S. Ct. 585 (plurality
opinion).  Douglas relied on Griffin's reasoning to hold that, in first appeals
as of right, States must appoint counsel to represent indigent defendants.  372
U.S., at 357, 9 L. Ed. 2d 811, 83 S. Ct. 814.  Ross held, however, that a State
need not appoint counsel to aid a poor person in discretionary appeals to the
State's highest court, or in petitioning for review in this Court.  417 U.S., at
610-612, 615-618, 41 L. Ed. 2d 341, 94 S. Ct. 2437.

[HN3] Cases on appeal barriers encountered by persons unable to pay their own
way, we have observed, ""cannot be resolved by resort to easy slogans or
pigeonhole analysis.""  M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 120, 136 L. Ed. 2d 473,
117 S. Ct. 555 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Our decisions in
point reflect ""both equal protection and due process concerns."" Ibid. ""The equal
protection concern relates to the legitimacy of fencing out would-be  [*611]
appellants based solely on their inability to pay core costs,"" while ""[t]he due
process concern homes in on the essential fairness of the state-ordered
proceedings."" Ibid.; see also Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U.S. 387, 405, 83 L. Ed. 2d
821, 105 S. Ct. 830 (1985).

[HN4] Two considerations were key to our decision in Douglas that a State is
required to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant's first-tier appeal as of
right.  First, such an appeal entails an adjudication on the ""merits.""  372
U.S., at 357, 9 L. Ed. 2d 811, 83 S. Ct. 814.  Second, first-tier review differs
from subsequent appellate stages ""at which the claims have once been presented
by [appellate counsel] and passed upon by an appellate court.""  Id., at 356, 9
L. Ed. 2d 811, 83 S. Ct. 814.  Under the California system at issue in Douglas,
the first-tier appellate court independently examined the record to determine
whether to appoint counsel.  Id., at 355, 9 L. Ed. 2d 811, 83 S. Ct. 814.  When
a defendant able to retain counsel pursued an appeal, the Douglas Court
observed, ""the appellate court passe[d] on the merits of [the] case only after
having the full benefit of written briefs and oral argument by counsel.""  Id.,
at 356, 9 L. Ed. 2d 811, 83 S. Ct. 814.  In contrast, when a poor person
appealed, ""the appellate court [wa]s forced to prejudge the merits [of the case]
before it c[ould] even determine whether counsel should be provided."" Ibid.

In Ross, we explained why the rationale of Douglas did not extend to the
appointment of counsel for an indigent seeking to pursue a second-tier
discretionary appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court or, thereafter,
[***561]  certiorari review in this Court.  The North Carolina Supreme Court, in
common with this Court we perceived, does not sit as an error-correction
instance.  417 U.S., at 615, 41 L. Ed. 2d 341, 94 S. Ct. 2437.  Principal
criteria for state high court review, we noted, included ""whether the subject
matter of the appeal has significant public interest, whether the cause involves
legal principles of major significance to the jurisprudence of the State, [and]
whether the decision below is in probable conflict"" with the court's precedent.
Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Further, we pointed out, a defendant
who had already benefited [*612]  from counsel's aid in a first-tier appeal as
of right would have, ""at the very least, a transcript or other record of trial
proceedings, a brief on his behalf in the Court of Appeals setting forth his
claims of error, and in many cases an opinion by the Court of Appeals disposing
of his case."" Ibid.

A

[HN5] Michigan has a two-tier appellate system comprising the State Supreme
Court [**2588]  and the intermediate Court of Appeals.  The Michigan Supreme
Court hears appeals by leave only.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 770.3(6) (West Supp.
2004).  Prior to 1994, the Court of Appeals adjudicated appeals as of right from
all criminal convictions.  Bulger, 462 Mich., at 503-504, 614 N. W. 2d, at
106-107.  To reduce the workload of the Court of Appeals, a 1994 amendment to
the Michigan Constitution changed the process for appeals following plea-based
convictions.  Id., at 504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 106-107.  As amended, the State
Constitution provides:  [HN6] ""In every criminal prosecution, the accused shall
have the right . . . to have an appeal as a matter of right, except as provided
by law an appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by
leave of the court."" Mich. Const., Art. 1, § 20.

[HN7] A defendant convicted by plea who seeks review in the Michigan Court of
Appeals must now file an application for leave to appeal pursuant to Mich. Ct.
Rule 7.205 (2005).  In response, the Court of Appeals may, among other things,
""grant or deny the application; enter a final decision; [or] grant other
relief."" Rule 7.205(D)(2).  If the court grants leave, ""the case proceeds as an
appeal of right."" Rule 7.205(D)(3).  The parties agree that the Court of
Appeals, in its orders denying properly filed applications for leave, uniformly
cites ""lack of merit in the grounds presented"" as the basis for its decision.
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 21-22, 24, 39.

[HN8] Under Michigan law, most indigent defendants convicted by plea must
proceed pro se in seeking leave to appeal. [*613]  Michigan Comp. Laws Ann. §
770.3a (West 2000) provides, in relevant part, that a ""defendant who pleads
guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo contendere shall not have appellate
counsel appointed for review of the defendant's conviction or sentence,"" except
that:


      [HN9] ""(2) The trial court shall appoint appellate counsel for an
     indigent defendant [if the] prosecuting attorney seeks leave to
     appeal[, the] defendant's sentence exceeds the upper limit of the
     minimum sentence range of the applicable sentencing guidelines[, the]
     court of appeals or the supreme court grants the defendant's
     application for leave to appeal[, or the] defendant  [***562]  seeks
     leave to appeal a conditional plea . . . .

     [HN10] ""(3) The trial court may appoint appellate counsel [if the]
     defendant seeks leave to appeal a sentence based upon an alleged
     improper scoring of an offense variable or a prior record variable[,
     the] defendant objected to the scoring or otherwise preserved the
     matter for appeal[, and the] sentence imposed by the court constitutes
     an upward departure from the upper limit of the minimum sentence range
     that the defendant alleges should have been scored."" § 770.3a(1)-(3).



In People v. Bulger, the Michigan Supreme Court considered whether the Federal
Constitution secures a right to appointed counsel for plea-convicted defendants
seeking review in the Court of Appeals.  462 Mich., at 511, 614 N. W. 2d, at 110
.  Recognizing Douglas and Ross as the guiding decisions, 462 Mich., at 511-516,
614 N. W. 2d, at 110-112, the State Supreme Court concluded that appointment of
counsel is not required for several reasons: Court of Appeals review following
plea-based convictions is by leave and is thus ""discretionary,"" id., at 506-508,
519, 614 N. W. 2d, at 108, 113; ""[p]lea proceedings are . . . shorter, simpler,
and more routine than trials,"" id., at 517, 614 N. W. 2d, at 112; and by
entering a plea, a defendant ""accede[s] to the state's fundamental interest
[*614]  in finality,"" ibid. In People v. Harris, the Michigan Supreme Court,
adhering to Bulger, upheld the [**2589]  constitutionality of § 770.3a.  470
Mich. 882, 681 N. W. 2d 653.

Petitioner Halbert pleaded nolo contendere to two counts of second-degree
criminal sexual conduct.  App. 23.  During Halbert's plea colloquy, the trial
court asked Halbert, ""You understand if I accept your plea you are giving up or
waiving any claim of an appeal as of right,"" and Halbert answered, ""Yes, sir.""
Id., at 22.  The court then advised Halbert of certain instances in which,
although the appeal would not be as of right, the court nevertheless ""must"" or
""may"" appoint appellate counsel.  The court did not tell Halbert, however, that
it could not appoint counsel in any other circumstances, including Halbert's own
case:


     ""THE COURT: You understand if I accept your plea and you are
     financially unable to retain a lawyer to represent you on appeal, the
     Court must appoint an attorney for you if the sentence I impose
     exceeds the sentencing guidelines or you seek leave to appeal a
     conditional plea or the prosecutor seeks leave to appeal or the Court
     of Appeals or Supreme Court grants you leave to appeal. Under those
     conditions I must appoint an attorney, do you understand that?

     ""THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.

     ""THE COURT: Further, if you are financially unable to retain a lawyer
     to represent you on appeal, the Court may appoint an attorney for you
     if you allege an improper scoring of the sentencing guidelines, you
     object to the scoring at the time of the sentencing and the sentence I
     impose exceeds the sentencing guidelines as you allege it should be
     scored.  Under those conditions I may appoint an attorney for you, do
     you understand that?

     [*615]  [***563]   ""THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir."" Id., at 22-23

trial judge, the form described the circumstances in which counsel must or may
be appointed, but did not expressly state that, absent such circumstances,
counsel would not be provided.  As revised, Michigan's notice form now states:

 At Halbert's sentencing hearing, defense counsel requested that the sentences
for the two counts run concurrently, but urged no error in the determination of
Halbert's exposure under the Michigan sentencing guidelines.  Id., at 33.  The
trial court set Halbert's sentences to run consecutively.  Id., at 35.  Halbert
submitted a handwritten motion to withdraw his plea the day after sentencing.
Denying the motion, the trial court stated that Halbert's ""proper remedy is to
appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals."" Id., at 43.

Twice thereafter and to no avail, Halbert asked the trial court to appoint
counsel to help him prepare an application for leave to appeal to the
intermediate appellate court.  He submitted his initial request on a form
provided by the State.  Id., at 46-50, 53-57.  The trial court denied the
request.  Id., at 44-45, 51-52.  Halbert next sent the trial court a letter and
accompanying motion, again seeking appointed counsel. Id., at 58.  Halbert
stated that his sentence had been misscored and that he needed the aid of
counsel to preserve [**2590]  the issue before undertaking an appeal.  Id., at
58, 61-62.  Halbert also related that he had ""required special education due to
learning disabilities,"" id., at 61, and was ""mentally impaired,"" id., at 62.  To
prepare his pro se filings, he noted,  [*616]  he was obliged to rely on the
assistance of fellow inmates.  Id., at 61.  The trial court denied Halbert's
motion; citing Bulger, the court stated that Halbert ""does not have a
constitutional . . . right to appointment of appellate counsel to pursue a
discretionary appeal."" App. 64.

Again using a form supplied by the State and acting pro se, Halbert filed an
application for leave to appeal. Id., at 66-71.  He asserted claims of
sentencing error and ineffective assistance of counsel, id., at 68, and sought,
inter alia, remand for appointment of appellate counsel and resentencing, id.,
at 71.  In a standard form order, the Court of Appeals denied Halbert's
application ""for lack of merit in the grounds presented."" Id., at 72.

The State Supreme Court, dividing 5 to 2, denied Halbert's application for leave
to appeal to that court.  The dissenting justices would have provided for the
appointment of counsel, and would have allowed counsel to file a supplemental
leave application prior to the Court of Appeals' reconsideration of Halbert's
pleas.  Id., at 84.

We granted certiorari, 543 U.S. 1042, 160 L. Ed. 2d 609, 125 S. Ct. 823 (2005),
to consider whether the denial of appointed counsel to Halbert violated the
Fourteenth Amendment.  We now vacate the judgment of the Michigan Court of
Appeals.

[***564]  III

[***LEdHR1A] [1B] Petitioner Halbert's case is framed by two prior decisions of
this Court concerning state-funded appellate counsel, Douglas and Ross. The
question before us is essentially one of classification: With which of those
decisions should the instant case be aligned? 2 We hold that Douglas provides
the [*617]  controlling instruction.  Two aspects of the Michigan Court of
Appeals' process following plea-based convictions lead us to that conclusion.
First, in determining how to dispose of an application for leave to appeal,
Michigan's intermediate appellate court looks to the merits of the claims made
in the application.  Second, indigent defendants pursuing first-tier review in
the Court of Appeals are generally ill equipped to represent themselves.

2 The question at hand, all Members of the Court agree, is whether this case
should be bracketed with Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 9 L. Ed. 2d 811,
83 S. Ct. 814 (1963), because appointed counsel is sought for initial review
before an intermediate appellate court, or with Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.S. 600,
41 L. Ed. 2d 341, 94 S. Ct. 2437 (1974), because a plea-convicted defendant must
file an application for leave to appeal. See post, at 628, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at
570-571 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (""Michigan's system bears some similarity to
the state systems at issue in both Douglas and Ross."").

  [HN11] A defendant who pleads guilty or nolo contendere in a Michigan court
does not thereby forfeit all opportunity for appellate review.  Although he
relinquishes access to an appeal as of right, he is entitled to apply for leave
to appeal, and that entitlement is officially conveyed to him.  See supra, at
612, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 561; Mich. Ct. Rule 6.425(E)(2)(a) (2005) (""[T]he
defendant is entitled to file an application for leave to appeal.""); see also
Advice Concerning Right To Appeal, P 1 (""You are entitled to file an application
for leave to appeal with the Court of Appeals."") see supra, at 615, n. 1, 162 L.
Ed. 2d, at 563. Of critical importance, the tribunal to which he addresses his
application, the Michigan Court of Appeals, unlike the Michigan Supreme Court,
sits as an error-correction instance. 3

3 Both the majority and the dissent in People v. Bulger, 462 Mich. 495, 614
N.W.2d 103 (2000), described the State's intermediate appellate court's function
as error correction.  Compare id., at 516-518, 614 N. W. 2d, at 112-113 (in the
majority's view, the Court of Appeals could perform its review function, despite
the defendant's lack of representation, because plea-convicted defendants have
ample aid for preservation of their claims in the trial court and ineffective
assistance of counsel should be readily apparent to the Court of Appeals from
the record), with id., at 543, 614 N. W. 2d, at 125 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting)
(""[T]he function of our Court of Appeals is reviewing the merits and correcting
errors made by the lower courts."").
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  [HN12]  [**2591]  The Court of Appeals may respond to a leave application in a
number of ways.  It ""may grant or deny the application; enter a final decision;
grant other relief; request additional material from the record; or require a
certified concise statement of proceedings and facts from the court . . . whose
order [*618]  is being appealed."" Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205(D)(2) (2005).  When the
court denies leave using the stock phrase ""for lack of merit in the grounds
presented,"" its disposition may not be equivalent to a ""final decision"" on the
merits, i.e., the disposition may simply signal that the court found the matters
asserted unworthy of the expenditure of further judicial resources.  But the
court's response to the leave application by any of the specified
alternatives--including denial of leave--necessarily entails some evaluation of
the merits  [***565]  of the applicant's claims.

Michigan urges that review in the Court of Appeals following a plea-based
conviction is as ""discretionary"" as review in the Michigan Supreme Court because
both require an application for leave to appeal. See Bulger, 462 Mich., at
506-508, 519, 614 N. W. 2d, at 108, 113; Brief for Respondent 31-34. 4
Therefore,  Michigan maintains, Ross is dispositive of this case.  The Court in
Ross, however, recognized that leave-granting determinations by North Carolina's
Supreme Court turned on considerations other than the commission of error by a
lower court, e.g., the involvement of a matter of ""significant public interest.""
See supra, at 611, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 561.  Michigan's Supreme Court, too, sits
not to correct errors in individual cases, but to decide matters of larger
public import.  See Mich. Ct. Rule 7.302(B)(2)-(3) (2005) (criteria for granting
leave to appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court include whether a case presents an
""issue [of] significant public interest"" or ""involves legal principles of major
significance to the state's jurisprudence""); Great Lakes Realty Corp. v. Peters,
[*619]  336 Mich. 325, 328-329, 57 N.W.2d 901, 903 (1953) (equating denial of an
application for leave to appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court with denial of a
petition for writ of certiorari in this Court); see also this Court's Rule 10
(considerations guiding decision whether to grant certiorari).  By contrast, the
Michigan Court of Appeals, because it is an error-correction instance, is guided
in responding to leave to appeal applications by the merits of the particular
defendant's claims, not by the general importance of the questions presented.

4 The Bulger opinions nowhere describe the discretion exercised by the Michigan
Court of Appeals as so unconstrained that it may ""deny leave [to appeal] for any
reason, or for no reason at all."" Post, at 633, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 575 (Thomas,
J., dissenting).  Compare Bulger, 462 Mich., at 511, 614 N. W. 2d, at 110
(appeal to intermediate court is discretionary because a defendant must
""obtai[n] leave""); id., at 506-508, 519, 614 N. W. 2d, at 108, 113, with id., at
542-543, 614 N. W. 2d, at 125 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting) (Court of Appeals may
deny leave to appeal where error is not outcome determinative).

 [HN13] Whether formally categorized as the decision of an appeal or the
disposal of a leave application, the Court of Appeals' ruling on a
plea-convicted defendant's claims provides the first, and likely the only,
direct review the defendant's conviction and sentence will receive.  Parties
like Halbert, however, are disarmed in their [**2592]  endeavor to gain
first-tier review.  As the Court in Ross emphasized, a defendant seeking State
Supreme Court review following a first-tier appeal as of right earlier had the
assistance of appellate counsel.  The attorney appointed to serve at the
intermediate appellate court level will have reviewed the trial court record,
researched the legal issues, and prepared a brief reflecting that review and
research.  417 U.S., at 615, 41 L. Ed. 2d 341, 94 S. Ct. 2437.  The defendant
seeking second-tier review may also be armed with an opinion of the intermediate
appellate court addressing the issues counsel raised.  A first-tier review
applicant, forced to act pro se, will face a record unreviewed by appellate
counsel, and will be equipped with no attorney's brief prepared for, or reasoned
opinion by, a court of review.

The Bulger court concluded that ""a pro se defendant seeking discretionary
[***566]  review"" in the Court of Appeals is adequately armed because he ""will
have the benefit of a transcript, trial counsel's framing of the issues in [a]
motion to withdraw, and the trial court's ruling on the motion.""  462 Mich., at
518, 614 N. W. 2d, at 113; see also Mich. Ct. Rule 6.005(H)(4) (2005) (trial
counsel must file ""postconviction motions [*620]  the lawyer deems appropriate,
including motions . . . to withdraw plea, or for resentencing""); post, at
634-635, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 575 (Thomas, J., dissenting). 5 But we held in
Swenson v. Bosler, 386 U.S. 258, 18 L. Ed. 2d 33, 87 S. Ct. 996 (1967) (per
curiam), that comparable materials prepared by trial counsel are no substitute
for an appellate lawyer's aid.  There, the Missouri court reviewing an
indigent's post-trial appeal had before it a transcript plus trial counsel's
""notice of appeal and . . . motion for new trial which specifically designated
the issues which could be considered on direct appeal.""  Id., at 259, 18 L. Ed.
2d 33, 87 S. Ct. 996.  The absence of counsel in these circumstances, Bosler
held, ""violated [the defendant's] Fourteenth Amendment rights, as defined in
Douglas."" Ibid. Adhering to Douglas, we explained that  [HN14] ""[t]he assistance
of appellate counsel in preparing and submitting a brief to the appellate court
which defines the legal principles upon which the claims of error are based and
which designates and interprets the relevant portions of the [record] may well
be of substantial benefit to the defendant [and] may not be denied . . . solely
because of his indigency.""  386 U.S., at 259, 18 L. Ed. 2d 33, 87 S. Ct. 996.
Although Bosler involved a post-trial rather than postplea appeal, the Court
recognized that a transcript and motion by trial counsel are not adequate
stand-ins for an appellate lawyer's review of the record and legal research.
Without guides keyed to a court of review, a pro se applicant's entitlement to
seek leave to appeal to Michigan's intermediate court may be more formal than
real.

5 This assumes that trial counsel will recognize, in a postconviction motion,
any issues appropriate for preservation for appellate review.  A lawyer may not,
however, perceive his own errors or the need for such a motion.  Defense counsel
here, for example, whose performance Halbert alleged to be ineffective,
apparently did not assist Halbert in preparing and filing his motion to withdraw
his plea.  See supra, at 615-616, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 563.

Persons in Halbert's situation are particularly handicapped as
self-representatives.  As recounted earlier this Term, ""[a]pproximately 70% of
indigent defendants represented by appointed counsel plead guilty, and 70% of
those convicted [*621]  are incarcerated.""  Kowalski, 543 U.S., at 140, 160 L.
Ed. 2d 519, 125 S. Ct. 564 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).  ""[Sixty-eight percent]
of the state prison populatio[n] did not complete high school, and many lack the
most basic literacy skills."" Ibid. (citation omitted).  ""[S]even out of ten
inmates fall in the lowest two out of five levels of literacy--marked by an
[**2593] inability to do such basic tasks as write a brief letter to explain an
error on a credit card bill, use a bus schedule, or state in writing an argument
made in a lengthy newspaper article."" Ibid. Many, Halbert among them, have
learning disabilities and mental impairments.  See U. S. Dept. of Justice,
Bureau of Justice Statistics, A. Beck & L. Maruschak, Mental Health Treatment in
State Prisons, 2000, pp 3-4 (July 2001),
http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/mhtsp00.pdf  [***567]  (identifying as
mentally ill some 16% of state prisoners and noting that 10% receive
psychotropic medication).

[***LEdHR1A] [1C]  [***LEdHR3] [3] Navigating the appellate process without a
lawyer's assistance is a perilous endeavor for a layperson,  and well beyond the
competence of individuals, like Halbert, who have little education, learning
disabilities, and mental impairments.  See Evitts, 469 U.S., at 393, 83 L. Ed.
2d 821, 105 S. Ct. 830 (""[T]he services of a lawyer will for virtually every
layman be necessary to present an appeal in a form suitable for appellate
consideration on the merits.""); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 345, 9 L.
Ed. 2d 799, 83 S. Ct. 792 (1963) (""Even the intelligent and educated layman has
small and sometimes no skill in the science of law."" (quoting Powell v. Alabama,
287 U.S. 45, 69, 77 L. Ed. 158, 53 S. Ct. 55 (1932))).  Appeals by defendants
convicted on their pleas may involve ""myriad and often complicated"" substantive
issues, Kowalski, 543 U.S., at 145, 160 L. Ed. 2d 519, 125 S. Ct. 564 (Ginsburg,

contendere may still raise on appeal


     ""constitutional defects that are irrelevant to his factual guilt,

[***LEdHR1A]  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA or Act), 84
Stat. 175, as amended, 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. V), is a
Spending Clause statute that seeks to ensure that ""all children with
disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education,"" §
1400(d)(1)(A) (2000 ed. and Supp. V).   [HN1] Under IDEA, school districts must
create an ""individualized education program"" (IEP) for each disabled child.  §
1414(d).  If parents believe their child's IEP is inappropriate, they may
request an ""impartial due process hearing."" § 1415(f).  The Act is silent,
however, as to which party bears the burden of persuasion at such a hearing.  We
hold that the burden lies, as it typically does, on the party seeking relief.

Congress first passed IDEA as part of the Education of the Handicapped Act in
1970, 84 Stat. 175, and amended it  [*52]  substantially in the Education for
All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, 89 Stat. 773.  At the time the majority of
disabled children in America were ""either totally excluded from schools or
sitting idly in regular classrooms awaiting the time when they were old enough
to 'drop out,'"" H. R. Rep. No. 94-332, p 2 (1975).  IDEA was intended to reverse
this history of neglect.  As of 2003, the Act governed the provision of special
education services to nearly 7 million children across the country.  See Dept.
of Education, Office of Special Education Programs, Data Analysis System,
http://www.ideadata.org/tables27th/ar_aa9.htm (as visited Nov. 9, 2005, and
available in Clerk of Court's case file).

[HN2] IDEA is ""frequently described as a model of 'cooperative federalism.'""
Little Rock School Dist. v. Mauney, 183 F.3d 816, 830 (CA8 1999).  It ""leaves to
the States the primary responsibility for developing and executing educational
programs for handicapped children, [but] imposes significant requirements to be
followed in the discharge of that responsibility.""  Board of Ed. of Hendrick
Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester Cty. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 183, 102
S. Ct. 3034, 73 L. Ed. 2d 690 (1982).  For example, the Act mandates cooperation
and reporting between state and federal educational authorities.  Participating
States must certify [**532]  to the Secretary of Education that they have
""policies and procedures"" that will effectively meet the Act's conditions.  20
U.S.C. § 1412(a).  (Unless otherwise noted, all citations to the Act are to the
pre-2004 version of the statute because this is the version that was in effect
during the proceedings below.  We note, however, that nothing in the recent 2004
amendments, 118 Stat. 2674, appears to materially affect the rule announced
here.) State educational agencies, in turn, must ensure that local schools and
teachers are meeting the State's educational standards.  §§ 1412(a)(11),
1412(a)(15)(A).  Local educational agencies (school boards or other
administrative bodies) can receive IDEA funds only if they certify to a state
educational  [*53]  agency that they are acting in accordance with the State's
policies and procedures.  § 1413(a)(1).

[***394]  The core of the statute, however, is the cooperative process that it
establishes between parents and schools.   Rowley, supra, at 205-206, 102 S. Ct.
3034, 73 L. Ed. 690 (""Congress placed every bit as much emphasis upon compliance
with procedures giving parents and guardians a large measure of participation at
every stage of the administrative process, . . . as it did upon the measurement
of the resulting IEP against a substantive standard"").  The central vehicle for
this collaboration is the IEP process.   [HN3] State educational authorities
must identify and evaluate disabled children, §§ 1414(a)-(c), develop an IEP for
each one, § 1414(d)(2), and review every IEP at least once a year, § 1414(d)(4).
Each IEP must include an assessment of the child's current educational
performance, must articulate measurable educational goals, and must specify the
nature of the special services that the school will provide.  § 1414(d)(1)(A).

[HN4] Parents and guardians play a significant role in the IEP process.  They
must be informed about and consent to evaluations of their child under the Act.
§ 1414(c)(3).  Parents are included as members of ""IEP teams."" § 1414(d)(1)(B).
They have the right to examine any records relating to their child, and to
obtain an ""independent educational evaluation of the[ir] child."" § 1415(b)(1).
They must be given written prior notice of any changes in an IEP, § 1415(b)(3),
and be notified in writing of the procedural safeguards available to them under
the Act, § 1415(d)(1).  If parents believe that an IEP is not appropriate, they
may seek an administrative ""impartial due process hearing."" § 1415(f).  School
districts may also seek such hearings, as Congress clarified in the 2004
amendments.  See S. Rep. No. 108-185, p 37 (2003).  They may do so, for example,
if they wish to change an existing IEP but the parents do not consent, or if
parents refuse to allow their child to be evaluated.  As a practical matter,
[*54]  it appears that most hearing requests come from parents rather than
schools.  Brief for Petitioners 7.

[HN5] Although state authorities have limited discretion to determine who
conducts the hearings, § 1415(f)(1), and responsibility generally for
establishing fair hearing procedures, § 1415(a), Congress has chosen to
legislate the central components of due process hearings.  It has imposed
minimal pleading standards, requiring parties to file complaints setting forth
""a description of the nature of the problem,"" § 1415(b)(7)(A)(ii), and ""a
proposed resolution of the problem to the extent known and available . . . at
the time,"" § 1415(b)(7)(B)(iii).  At the hearing, all parties may be accompanied
by counsel, and may ""present evidence and confront, cross-examine, and compel
the attendance of witnesses."" §§ 1415(h)(1)-(2).  After the hearing, any
aggrieved party may bring a civil action in state or federal court.  §
1415(i)(2).  Prevailing parents may also [**533]  recover attorney's fees.  §
1415(i)(3)(B).  Congress has never explicitly stated, however, which party
should bear the burden of proof at IDEA hearings.

B

This case concerns the educational services that were due, under IDEA, to
petitioner Brian Schaffer.  Brian suffers from learning disabilities and
speech-language impairments.  From prekindergarten through seventh grade he
attended a private school  [***395]  and struggled academically.  In 1997,
school officials informed Brian's mother that he needed a school that could
better accommodate his needs.  Brian's parents contacted respondent Montgomery
County Public Schools System (MCPS) seeking a placement for him for the
following school year.

MCPS evaluated Brian and convened an IEP team.  The committee generated an
initial IEP offering Brian a place in either of two MCPS middle schools.
Brian's parents were not satisfied with the arrangement, believing that Brian
[*55]  needed smaller classes and more intensive services.  The Schaffers thus
enrolled Brian in another private school, and initiated a due process hearing
challenging the IEP and seeking compensation for the cost of Brian's subsequent
private education.

In Maryland, IEP hearings are conducted by administrative law judges (ALJs).
See Md. Educ. Code Ann. § 8-413(c) (Lexis 2004).  After a 3-day hearing, the ALJ
deemed the evidence close, held that the parents bore the burden of persuasion,
and ruled in favor of the school district. The parents brought a civil action
challenging the result.  The United States District Court for the District of
Maryland reversed and remanded, after concluding that the burden of persuasion
is on the school district.  Brian S. v. Vance, 86 F. Supp. 2d 538 (2000).
Around the same time, MCPS offered Brian a placement in a high school with a
special learning center.  Brian's parents accepted, and Brian was educated in
that program until he graduated from high school.  The suit remained alive,
however, because the parents sought compensation for the private school tuition
and related expenses.

Respondents appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit.  While the appeal was pending, the ALJ reconsidered the case, deemed
the evidence truly in ""equipoise,"" and ruled in favor of the parents.  The
Fourth Circuit vacated and remanded the appeal so that it could consider the
burden of proof issue along with the merits on a later appeal.  The District
Court reaffirmed its ruling that the school district has the burden of proof.
240 F. Supp. 2d 396 (Md. 2002).  On appeal, a divided panel of the Fourth
Circuit reversed.  Judge Michael, writing for the majority, concluded that
petitioners offered no persuasive reason to ""depart from the normal rule of
allocating the burden to the party seeking relief.""  377 F.3d 449, 453 (2004).
We granted certiorari 543 U.S. 1145, 543 U.S. 1145, 125 S. Ct. 1300, 161 L. Ed.
2d 104 (2005), to resolve the following  [*56]  question: At an administrative
hearing assessing the appropriateness of an IEP, which party bears the burden of
persuasion?

legal terms."" 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence § 342, p 433 (5th ed. 1999)
(hereinafter McCormick).  Part of the confusion surrounding the term arises from
the fact that historically,  [HN6] the concept encompassed two distinct burdens:
the ""burden of persuasion,"" i.e., which party [**534]  loses if the evidence is
closely balanced, and the ""burden of production,"" i.e., which party bears the
obligation to come forward with the evidence at different points in the
proceeding.   Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Greenwich
Collieries, 512 U.S. 267, 272,  [***396]  114 S. Ct. 2251, 129 L. Ed. 2d 221
(1994).  We note at the outset that this case concerns only the burden of
persuasion, as the parties agree, Brief for Respondents 14; Reply Brief for
Petitioners 15, and when we speak of burden of proof in this opinion, it is this
to which we refer.

[HN7]  [***LEdHR2] [2]  [***LEdHR3A]  When we are determining the burden of
proof under a statutory cause of action, the touchstone of our inquiry is, of
course, the statute.  The plain text of IDEA is silent on the allocation of the
burden of persuasion. We therefore begin with  [HN8] the ordinary default rule
that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims.  McCormick §
337, at 412 (""The burdens of pleading and proof with regard to most facts have
been and should be assigned to the plaintiff who generally seeks to change the
present state of affairs and who therefore naturally should be expected to bear
the risk of failure of proof or persuasion""); C. Mueller & L. Kirkpatrick,
Evidence § 3.1, p 104 (3d ed. 2003) (""Perhaps the broadest and most accepted
idea is that the person who seeks court action should justify the request, which
means that the plaintiffs bear the burdens on the elements in their claims"").

[*57]  Thus, we have usually assumed without comment that plaintiffs bear the
burden of persuasion regarding the essential aspects of their claims.  For
example, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.,
does not directly state that plaintiffs bear the ""ultimate"" burden of
persuasion, but we have so concluded.   St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509
U.S. 502, 511, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993);  id., at 531, 113 S.
Ct. 2742, 125 L. E.d 2d 407 (Souter, J., dissenting).  In numerous other areas,
we have presumed or held that the default rule applies.  See, e.g.,  Lujan v.
Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351
(1992) (standing);  Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems Corp., 526 U.S. 795,
806, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999) (Americans with Disabilities
Act);  Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 553, 119 S. Ct. 1545, 143 L. Ed. 2d 731
(1999) (equal protection);  Wharf (Holdings) Ltd. v. United Int'l Holdings,
Inc., 532 U.S. 588, 593, 121 S. Ct. 1776, 149 L. Ed. 2d 845 (2001) (securities
fraud);  Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U.S. 922, 931, 95 S. Ct. 2561, 45 L. Ed.
2d 648 (1975) (preliminary injunctions);  Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle,
429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S. Ct. 568, 50 L. Ed. 2d 471 (1977) (First Amendment).
Congress also expressed its approval of the general rule when it chose to apply
it to administrative proceedings under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5
U.S.C. § 556(d); see also  Greenwich Collieries, supra, at 271, 114 S. Ct. 2251,
129 L. Ed. 2d 221.

[HN9]  [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR3A]  The ordinary default rule, of course, admits
of exceptions.  See McCormick § 337, at 412-415.  For example, the burden of
persuasion as to certain elements of a plaintiff's claim may be shifted to
defendants, when such elements can fairly be characterized as affirmative
defenses or exemptions.  See, e.g.,  FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 44-45,
68 S. Ct. 822, 92 L. Ed. 1196, 44 F.T.C. 1499 (1948).  Under some circumstances
this Court has even placed the burden of persuasion over an entire claim on the
defendant.  See  Alaska Dept. of Environmental Conservation v. EPA, 540 U.S.
461, 494, 124 S. Ct. 983, 157 L. Ed. 2d 967 (2004).  But while  [***397]  the
normal default rule does not solve all cases, it certainly solves most of them.
Decisions that place the entire burden of persuasion [**535]  on the opposing
party at the outset of a proceeding--as petitioners urge us to do here--are
extremely rare.  Absent some reason to believe that Congress intended otherwise,
therefore,  [*58]  we will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it
usually falls, upon the party seeking relief.

B

[***LEdHR4] [4] Petitioners contend first that a close reading of IDEA's text
compels a conclusion in their favor.  They urge that we should interpret the
statutory words ""due process"" in light of their constitutional meaning, and
apply the balancing test established by  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 96
S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976).  Even assuming that the Act incorporates
constitutional due process doctrine, Eldridge is no help to petitioners because
[HN10] ""[o]utside the criminal law area, where special concerns attend, the
locus of the burden of persuasion is normally not an issue of federal
constitutional moment.""  Lavine v. Milne, 424 U.S. 577, 585, 96 S. Ct. 1010, 47
L. Ed. 2d 249 (1976).

[***LEdHR5] [5] Petitioners next contend that we should take instruction from
the lower court opinions of  Mills v. Board of Education, 348 F. Supp. 866 (DC
1972), and  Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children v. Pennsylvania, 334
F. Supp. 1257 (ED Pa. 1971) (hereinafter PARC).  IDEA's drafters were admittedly
guided ""to a significant extent"" by these two landmark cases.   Rowley, 458
U.S., at 194, 102 S. Ct. 3034, 73 L. Ed. 2d 690.  As the court below noted,
however, the fact that Congress ""took a number of the procedural safeguards from
PARC and Mills and wrote them directly into the Act"" does not allow us to
""conclude . . . that Congress intended to adopt the ideas that it failed to
write into the text of the statute.""  377 F.3d, at 455.

[***LEdHR1A]  Petitioners also urge that putting the burden of persuasion on
school districts will further IDEA's purposes because it will help ensure that
children receive a free appropriate public education. In truth, however, very
few cases will be in evidentiary equipoise. Assigning the burden of persuasion
to school districts might encourage schools to put more resources into preparing
IEPs and presenting their evidence.  But IDEA is silent about whether marginal
dollars should  [*59]  be allocated to litigation and administrative
expenditures or to educational services.  Moreover, there is reason to believe
that a great deal is already spent on the administration of the Act.  Litigating
a due process complaint is an expensive affair, costing schools approximately
$8,000 to $12,000 per hearing.  See Department of Education, J. Chambers, J.
Harr, & A. Dhanani, What Are We Spending on Procedural Safeguards in Special
Education 1999-2000, p 8 (May 2003) (prepared under contract by American
Institutes for Research, Special Education Expenditure Project).  Congress has
also repeatedly amended the Act in order to reduce its administrative and
litigation-related costs.  For example, in 1997  [HN11] Congress mandated that
States offer mediation for IDEA disputes. § 615(e) of IDEA, as added by § 101 of
the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997, Pub. L.
105-17, 111 Stat. 90, 20 U.S.C. § 1415(e).  In 2004, Congress added a mandatory
[***398]  ""resolution session"" prior to any due process hearing. § 615(f)(1)(B)
of IDEA, as added by § 101 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education
Improvement Act of 2004, Pub. L. 108-446, 118 Stat. 2720, 20 U.S.C. A. §
1415(f)(1)(B) (Supp. 2005).  It also made new findings that ""[p]arents and
schools should be given expanded opportunities to resolve their disagreements in
positive and constructive ways,"" and that ""[t]eachers, schools, local
educational agencies, and States should be  [**536]  relieved of irrelevant and
unnecessary paperwork burdens that do not lead to improved educational
outcomes."" §§ 1400(c)(8)-(9).

Petitioners in effect ask this Court to assume that every IEP is invalid until
the school district demonstrates that it is not.  The Act does not support this
conclusion.  IDEA relies heavily upon the expertise of school districts to meet
its goals.   [HN12] It also includes a so-called ""stay-put"" provision, which
requires a child to remain in his or her ""then-current educational placement""
during the pendency of an IDEA hearing.  § 1415(j).  Congress could have
required that a  [*60]  child be given the educational placement that a parent
requested during a dispute, but it did no such thing.  Congress appears to have
presumed instead that, if the Act's procedural requirements are respected,
parents will prevail when they have legitimate grievances.  See  Rowley, supra,
at 206, 102 S. Ct. 3034, 73 L. Ed. 2d 690 (noting the ""legislative conviction
that adequate compliance with the procedures prescribed would in most cases
assure much if not all of what Congress wished in the way of substantive content
in an IEP"").

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR6] [6] Petitioners' most plausible argument is that
[HN13] ""[t]he ordinary rule, based on considerations of fairness, does not place
the burden upon a litigant of establishing facts peculiarly within the knowledge
of his adversary.""  United States v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., 355 U.S. 253,
256, n. 5, 78 S. Ct. 212, 2 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1957); see also  Concrete Pipe &
Products of Cal., Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern Cal.,
508 U.S. 602, 626, 113 S. Ct. 2264, 124 L. Ed. 2d 539 (1993).  But this ""rule is
far from being universal, and has many qualifications upon its application.""
Greenleaf's Lessee v. Birth, 31 U.S. 302, 6 Pet. 302, 312, 8 L. Ed. 406 (1832);
see also McCormick § 337, at 413 (""Very often one must plead and prove matters
as to which his adversary has superior access to the proof"").  School districts
have a ""natural advantage"" in information and expertise, but Congress addressed
this when  [HN14] it obliged schools to safeguard the procedural rights of
parents and to share information with them.  See  School Comm. of Burlington v.
Department of Ed. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 368, 105 S. Ct. 1996, 85 L. Ed. 2d 385
(1985).  As noted above, parents have the right to review all records that the
school possesses in relation to their child.  § 1415(b)(1).  They also have the
right to an ""independent educational evaluation of the[ir] child."" Ibid. The
regulations clarify this entitlement by providing that a ""parent has the right
to an independent educational evaluation at public expense if the parent
disagrees with an evaluation obtained by the public agency."" 34 CFR §
300.502(b)(1) (2005).  IDEA thus ensures parents access to an expert who can
evaluate all the materials that the school  [*61]  must make available, and who
can give an independent opinion.  They are not left to  [***399]  challenge the
government without a realistic opportunity to access the necessary evidence, or
without an expert with the firepower to match the opposition.

[***LEdHR1A]  Additionally, in 2004,  [HN15] Congress added provisions requiring
school districts to answer the subject matter of a complaint in writing, and to
provide parents with the reasoning behind the disputed action, details about the
other options considered and rejected by the IEP team, and a description of all
evaluations, reports, and other factors that the school used in coming to its
decision.  § 615(c)(2)(B)(i)(I) of IDEA, as added by § 101 of Pub. L. 108-446, §
615(c)(2)(B)(i)(I), 118 Stat. 2718, 20 U.S.C. § 1415(c)(2)(B)(i)(I) (2000 ed.,
Supp. V).  Prior to a hearing, the parties must disclose evaluations and
recommendations that they intend to rely upon.  20 U.S.C. § 1415(f)(2).  IDEA
hearings are deliberately informal and intended to give ALJs the flexibility
that they need to ensure that each side can fairly present its evidence.
[**537]   [HN16] IDEA, in fact, requires state authorities toorganize hearings
in a way that guarantees parents and children the procedural protections of the
Act.  See § 1415(a).  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, parents may recover
attorney's fees if they prevail.  § 1415(i)(3)(B).  These protections ensure
that the school bears no unique informational advantage.

III

Finally, respondents and several States urge us to decide that States may, if
they wish, override the default rule and put the burden always on the school
district. Several States have laws or regulations purporting to do so, at least
under some circumstances.  See, e.g., Minn. Stat. § 125A.091, subd. 16 (2004);
Ala. Admin. Code Rule 290-8-9-.08(8)(c)(6) (Supp. 2004); Alaska Admin. Code,
tit. 4, § 52.550(e)(9) (2003); Del. Code Ann., Tit. 14, § 3140 (1999).  Because
no such law or regulation exists in Maryland, we need not decide this issue
[*62]  today.  Justice Breyer contends that the allocation of the burden ought
to be left entirely up to the States.  But neither party made this argument
before this Court or the courts below.  We therefore decline to address it.

[***LEdHR1A]  We hold no more than we must to resolve the case at hand:  [HN17]
The burden of proof in an administrative hearing challenging an IEP is properly
placed upon the party seeking relief.  In this case, that party is Brian, as
represented by his parents.  But the rule applies with equal effect to school
districts: If they seek to challenge an IEP, they will in turn bear the burden
of persuasion before an ALJ.  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals
for the Fourth Circuit is, therefore, affirmed.

It is so ordered.

The Chief Justice took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.

CONCUR BY: STEVENS

CONCUR

 Justice Stevens, concurring.

It is common ground that no single principle or rule solves all cases by setting
forth a general test for ascertaining the incidence of proof burdens when both a
statute and its legislative history are silent on the question.  See  Alaska
Dept. of Environmental Conservation v. EPA, 540 U.S. 461, 494, n. 17,  [***400]
124 S. Ct. 983, 157 L. Ed. 2d 967 (2004); see also  ante, at 57, 163 L. Ed. 2d,
at 396;  post, at 1-2, 163 L. Ed. 2d, at 400-401 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).
Accordingly, I do not understand the majority to disagree with the proposition
that a court, taking into account ""'policy considerations, convenience, and
fairness,'""  post, at 63, 163 L. Ed. 2d, at 400 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting),
could conclude that the purpose of a statute is best effectuated by placing the
burden of persuasion on the defendant.  Moreover, I agree with much of what
Justice Ginsburg has written about the special aspects of this statute.  I have,
however, decided to join the Court's disposition of this case, not only for the
reasons set forth in Justice O'Connor's opinion, but also because I believe that
we should presume that public school officials  [*63]  are properly performing
their difficult responsibilities under this important statute.

DISSENT BY: GINSBURG; BREYER

DISSENT

 Justice Ginsburg, dissenting.

When the legislature is silent on the burden of proof, courts ordinarily
allocate the burden to the party initiating the proceeding and seeking relief.
As the Fourth Circuit recognized, however, ""other factors,"" prime among them
""policy considerations, convenience, and fairness,"" may warrant a different
allocation.   377 F.3d 449, 452 (2004) (citing 2 J. Strong, McCormick on
Evidence § 337, p 415 (5th ed. 1999) (allocation of proof burden ""will depend
upon the weight . . . given to any one or more of several factors, including: .
. . special policy considerations[,] [**538]  convenience,[and] fairness"")); see
also 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 2486, p 291 (J. Chadbourn rev. ed. 1981)
(assigning proof burden presents ""a question of policy and fairness based on
experience in the different situations"").  The Court has followed the same
counsel.  See  Alaska Dept. of Environmental Conservation v. EPA, 540 U.S. 461,
494, n. 17, 124 S. Ct. 983, 157 L. Ed. 2d 967 (2004) (""No 'single principle or
rule . . . solve[s] all cases and afford[s] a general test for ascertaining the
incidence' of proof burdens."" (quoting Wigmore, supra, § 2486, p 288; emphasis
deleted)).  For reasons well stated by Circuit Judge Luttig, dissenting in the
Court of Appeals,  377 F.3d, at 456-459, I am persuaded that ""policy
considerations, convenience, and fairness"" call for assigning the burden of
proof to the school district in this case.

The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq.
, was designed to overcome the pattern of disregard and neglect disabled
children historically encountered in seeking access to public education. See §
1400(c)(2) (congressional findings); S. Rep. No. 94-168, pp 6, 8-9 (1975);
Mills v. Board of Ed. of District of Columbia, 348 F. Supp. 866 (DC 1972);
Pennsylvania Asso. for Retarded Children v. Pennsylvania, 334 F. Supp. 1257 (ED
Pa. 1971),  [*64]  and  343 F. Supp. 279 (ED Pa. 1972).  Under typical civil
rights and social welfare legislation, the complaining party must allege and
prove discrimination or qualification for statutory benefits.  See, e.g.,  St.
Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 511, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d
407 (1993) (Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,  42 U.S.C. § 2000e et
seq.);  Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Greenwich
Collieries, 512 U.S. 267, 270,  [***401]  114 S. Ct. 2251, 129 L. Ed. 2d 221
(1994) (Black Lung Benefits Act, 30 U.S.C. § 901 et seq.).  The IDEA is atypical
in this respect: It casts an affirmative, beneficiary-specific obligation on
providers of public education. School districts are charged with responsibility
to offer to each disabled child an individualized education program (IEP)
suitable to the child's special needs.  20 U.S.C. §§ 1400(d)(1), 1412(a)(4),
1414(d).  The proponent of the IEP, it seems to me, is properly called upon to
demonstrate its adequacy.

Familiar with the full range of education facilities in the area, and informed
by ""their experiences with other, similarly-disabled children,""  377 F.3d, at
458 (Luttig, J., dissenting), ""the school district is . . . in a far better
position to demonstrate that it has fulfilled [its statutory] obligation than
the disabled student's parents are in to show that the school district has
failed to do so,""  id., at 457.  Accord  Oberti v. Board of Ed. of Borough of
Clementon School Dist., 995 F.2d 1204, 1219 (CA3 1993) (""In practical terms, the
school has an advantage when a dispute arises under the Act: the school has
better access to relevant information, greater control over the potentially more
persuasive witnesses (those who have been directly involved with the child's
education), and greater overall educational expertise than the parents."");

be merely to place in issue the appropriateness of the IEP.  The school board

reaching that result, we have sought to implement the intent of the statutory
and regulatory [**539]  schemes.""). 1

 [*526]  [**2644]   Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR3A]  After the federal courts denied
petitioner habeas corpus relief from his state conviction, he filed a motion for
relief from that judgment, pursuant to  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b).
The question presented is whether, in a habeas case, such motions are subject to
the additional restrictions that apply to ""second or successive"" habeas corpus
petitions under the provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty
Act of 1996 (AEDPA), codified at 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b).

I

Petitioner Aurelio Gonzalez pleaded guilty in Florida Circuit Court to one count
of robbery with a firearm.  He filed no appeal and began serving his 99-year
sentence in 1982.  Some 12 years later, petitioner began to seek relief from his
conviction.  He filed two motions for state [**2645]  postconviction relief,
which the Florida courts denied.  Thereafter, in June 1997, petitioner filed a
federal habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Florida,  [*527]  alleging that his guilty plea had not been entered
knowingly and voluntarily.

Upon the State's motion, the District Court dismissed petitioner's habeas
petition as barred by AEDPA's statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d).
Under Eleventh Circuit precedent, petitioner's filing deadline, absent tolling,
was April 23, 1997, one year after AEDPA's statute of limitations took effect.
Wilcox v. Florida Dep't of Corrs., 158 F.3d 1209, 1211 (CA11 1998) (per curiam).
Adopting a Magistrate Judge's recommendation, the District Court concluded that
the limitations period was not tolled during the 163-day period while
petitioner's second motion for state postconviction relief was pending.   [HN1]
Section 2244(d)(2) tolls the statute of limitations during the pendency of
""properly filed"" applications only, and the District Court thought petitioner's
motion was not ""properly filed"" because it was both untimely and successive.
Without tolling, petitioner's federal habeas petition was two months late, so
the District Court dismissed it as time barred. A judge of the Eleventh Circuit
denied a certificate of appealability (COA) on April 6, 2000, and petitioner did
not file for rehearing or review of that decision.

[***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR3A]  On November 7, 2000, we held in Artuz v. Bennett,
531 U.S. 4, 148 L. Ed. 2d 213, 121 S. Ct. 361, that  [HN2] an application for
state postconviction relief can be ""properly filed"" even if the state courts
dismiss it as procedurally barred.  See id., at, 531 U.S. 4, 148 L. Ed. 2d 213,
121 S. Ct. 361.  Almost nine months later, petitioner filed in the District
Court a pro se ""Motion to Amend or Alter Judgment,"" contending  [***490]  that
the District Court's time-bar ruling was incorrect under Artuz's construction of
§ 2244(d), and invoking  [HN3] Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6), which
permits a court to relieve a party from the effect of a final judgment. 1 The
District Court denied the motion, and petitioner appealed.

petitioner a COA, but a panel quashed the certificate as improvidently granted.
317 F.3d 1308, 1310, 1314 (2003).  The full court vacated that order and reheard
the case en banc.  It granted petitioner a COA but held, by a vote of 7 to 4,
that the District Court was correct to deny his Rule 60(b) motion.  The en banc
majority determined that petitioner's motion--indeed,  any postjudgment motion
under Rule 60(b) save one alleging fraud on the court under Rule 60(b)(3) --was
in substance a second or successive habeas corpus petition.  366 F.3d 1253,
1278, 1281-1282 (2004).   [HN4] A state prisoner may not file such a petition
without precertification by the court of appeals that the petition meets certain
stringent criteria.  § 2244(b).  Because petitioner's motion did not satisfy
these requirements, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed its denial.  Id., at 1282.

[HN5]  [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A] Rule 60(b)allows a party to seek relief from
a final judgment, and request reopening of his case, under a limited set of
circumstances including fraud, mistake, and newly discovered evidence. 2  [HN6]
Rule 60(b)(6), [**2646]  the particular provision  [*529]  under which
petitioner brought his motion, permits reopening when the movant shows ""any . .
. reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment"" other than the
more specific circumstances set out in Rules 60(b)(1)-(5).  See Liljeberg v.
Health Services Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 863, n 11, 100 L. Ed. 2d 855,
108 S. Ct. 2194 (1988); Klapprott v. United States, 335 U.S. 601, 613, 93 L. Ed.
266, 69 S. Ct. 384 (1949) (opinion of Black, J.).  The mere recitation of these
provisions shows why we give little weight to respondent's appeal to the virtues
of finality. That policy consideration, standing alone, is unpersuasive in the
interpretation of a provision whose whole purpose is to make an exception to
finality. The issue here is whether the text of Rule 60(b) itself, or of some
other provision of law, limits its application  [***491]  in a manner relevant
to the case before us.

2 Rule 60(b) provides in relevant part:  [HN7] ""On motion and upon such terms as
are just, the court may relieve a party . . . from a final judgment, order, or
proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could
not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b); (3)
fraud . . ., misrepresentation, or misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the
judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged,
or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise
vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective
application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the
judgment.  The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons
(1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order, or
proceeding was entered or taken.""

  [HN8]  [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR4] [4]  [***LEdHR5A]  AEDPA did not expressly
circumscribe the operation of Rule 60(b).  (By contrast, AEDPA directly amended
other provisions of the Federal Rules.  See, e.g., AEDPA, § 103, 110 Stat. 1218
(amending Fed. Rule App. Proc. 22).) The new habeas restrictions introduced by
AEDPA are made indirectly relevant, however, by the fact that Rule 60(b), like
the rest of the Rules of Civil Procedure, applies in habeas corpus proceedings
under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 3 only ""to the extent that [it is] not inconsistent with""
applicable federal statutory provisions and rules.  28 U.S.C. § 2254 Rule 11;
see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 81(a)(2).   [HN9] The relevant provisions of the
AEDPA-amended habeas statutes, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2244(b)(1)-(3), impose three
requirements on second or successive habeas petitions: First, any claim that has
already  [*530]  been adjudicated in a previous petition must be dismissed.  §
2244(b)(1).  Second, any claim that has not already been adjudicated must be
dismissed unless it relies on either a new and retroactive rule of
constitutional law or new facts showing a high probability of actual innocence.
§ 2244(b)(2).  Third, before the district court may accept a successive petition
for filing, the court of appeals must determine that it presents a claim not
previously raised that is sufficient to meet § 2244(b)(2)'s new-rule or
actual-innocence provisions.  § 2244(b)(3).  We proceed to consider whether
these provisions limit the application of Rule 60(b) to the present case.

3  [***LEdHR5A]  In this case we consider only the extent to which Rule 60(b)
applies to habeas proceedings under  [HN10] 28 U.S.C. § 2254, which governs
federal habeas relief for prisoners convicted in state court.  Federal prisoners
generally seek postconviction relief under § 2255, which contains its own
provision governing second or successive applications.  Although that portion of
§ 2255 is similar to, and refers to, the statutory subsection applicable to
second or successive § 2254 petitions, it is not identical.  Accordingly, we
limit our consideration to § 2254 cases.

A

[HN11]  [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR6] [6]  [***LEdHR7A]   [***LEdHR8A]  ""As a
textual matter, § 2244(b) applies only where the court acts pursuant to [**2647]
a prisoner's 'application'"" for a writ of habeas corpus.  Calderon v. Thompson,
523 U.S. 538, 554, 140 L. Ed. 2d 728, 118 S. Ct. 1489 (1998).  We therefore must
decide whether a Rule 60(b) motion filed by a habeas petitioner is a ""habeas
corpus application"" as the statute uses that term.

[HN12] Under § 2244(b), the first step of analysis is to determine whether a
""claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application"" was also
""presented in a prior application."" If so, the claim must be dismissed; if not,
the analysis proceeds to whether the claim satisfies one of two narrow
exceptions.  In either event, it is clear that for purposes of § 2244(b) an
""application"" for habeas relief is a filing that contains one or more ""claims.""
That definition is consistent with the use of the term ""application"" in the
other habeas statutes in chapter 153 of title 28.  See, e.g.,  Woodford v.
Garceau, 538 U.S. 202, 207, 155 L. Ed. 2d 363, 123 S. Ct. 1398 (2003) (for
purposes of § 2254(d), an application for habeas corpus relief is a filing that
seeks ""an adjudication on the merits of the petitioner's claims"").  These
statutes, and our own decisions, make clear that a ""claim"" as used in § 2244(b)
is an asserted federal basis for relief from a state court's judgment of
conviction.

[***492]   [HN13]  [***LEdHR7A]  In some instances, a Rule 60(b) motion will
contain one or more ""claims."" For example, it might straightforwardly  [*531]
assert that owing to ""excusable neglect,"" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b)(1), the
movant's habeas petition had omitted a claim of constitutional error, and seek
leave to present that claim.  Cf. Harris v. United States, 367 F.3d 74, 80-81
(CA2 2004) (petitioner's Rule 60(b) motion sought relief from judgment because
habeas counsel had failed to raise a Sixth Amendment claim).  Similarly, a
motion might seek leave to present ""newly discovered evidence,"" Fed. Rule Civ.
Proc. 60(b)(2), in support of a claim previously denied.  E.g.,  Rodwell v.
Pepe, 324 F.3d 66, 69 (CA1 2003).  Or a motion might contend that a subsequent
change in substantive law is a ""reason justifying relief,"" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.
60(b)(6), from the previous denial of a claim.  E.g.,  Dunlap v. Litscher, 301
F.3d 873, 876 (CA7 2002).  Virtually every Court of Appeals to consider the
question has held that such a pleading, although labeled a Rule 60(b) motion, is
in substance a successive habeas petition and should be treated accordingly.
E.g.,  Rodwell, supra, at 71-72; Dunlap, supra, at 876.

We think those holdings are correct.  A habeas petitioner's filing that seeks
vindication of such a claim is, if not in substance a ""habeas corpus
application,"" at least similar enough that failing to subject it to the same
requirements would be ""inconsistent with"" the statute.  28 U.S.C. § 2254 Rule 11
.   [HN14] Using Rule 60(b) to present new claims for relief from a state
court's judgment of conviction--even claims couched in the language of a true
Rule 60(b) motion--circumvents AEDPA's requirement that a new claim be dismissed
unless it relies on either a new rule of constitutional law or newly discovered
facts.  § 2244(b)(2).  The same is true of a Rule 60(b)(2) motion presenting new
evidence in support of a claim already litigated: Even assuming that reliance on
a new factual predicate causes that motion to escape § 2244(b)(1)'s prohibition
of claims ""presented in a prior application,"" § 2244(b)(2)(B) requires a more
convincing factual showing than does Rule 60(b).  Likewise, a Rule 60(b) motion
based on a purported change in the substantive law governing the claim could be
used to circumvent § 2244(b)(2)(A)'s  [*532]  dictate that the only new law on
which a successive petition may rely is ""a new rule of constitutional law, made
retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme [**2648]  Court, that
was previously unavailable.""  [HN15] In addition to the substantive conflict
with AEDPA standards, in each of these three examples use of Rule 60(b) would
impermissibly circumvent the requirement that a successive habeas petition be
precertified by the court of appeals as falling within an exception to the
successive-petition bar.  § 2244(b)(3).

[***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR7A]   [***LEdHR8A]  In most cases, determining whether a
Rule 60(b) motion advances one or more ""claims"" will be relatively simple.  A
motion that seeks to add a new ground for relief, as in Harris, supra, will of
course qualify.  A motion can also be said to bring a ""claim"" if it attacks the
federal court's previous resolution of a claim on the merits, 4 since alleging
that the court erred in denying habeas  [***493]  relief on the merits is
effectively indistinguishable from alleging that the movant is, under the
substantive provisions of the statutes, entitled to habeas relief.  That is not
the case, however,  when a Rule 60(b) motion attacks, not the substance of the
federal court's resolution of a claim on the merits, but some defect in the
integrity of the federal habeas proceedings. 5

4  [***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR7A]   [***LEdHR8A]  The term ""on the merits"" has
multiple usages.  See, e.g.,  Semtek Int'l Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531
U.S. 497, 501-503, 149 L. Ed. 2d 32, 121 S. Ct. 1021 (2001).  We refer here to a
determination that there exist or do not exist grounds entitling a petitioner to
habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2254(a) and (d).  When a movant asserts
one of those grounds (or asserts that a previous ruling regarding one of those
grounds was in error) he is making a habeas corpus claim.  He is not doing so
when he merely asserts that a previous ruling which precluded a merits
determination was in error--for example, a denial for such reasons as failure to
exhaust, procedural default, or statute-of-limitations bar.

5  [***LEdHR7A]   [***LEdHR8A]  Fraud on the federal habeas court is one example
of such a defect.  See generally Rodriguez v. Mitchell, 252 F.3d 191, 199 (CA2
2001) (a witness's allegedly fraudulent basis for refusing to appear at a
federal habeas hearing ""relate[d] to the integrity of the federal habeas
proceeding, not to the integrity of the state criminal trial"").  We note that an
attack based on the movant's own conduct, or his habeas counsel's omissions,
see, e.g., supra, at 530-31, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 492, ordinarily does not go to
the integrity of the proceedings, but in effect asks for a second chance to have
the merits determined favorably.

 [*533]   B

[HN16]  [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]  When no ""claim"" is presented, there is no
basis for contending that the Rule 60(b) motion should be treated like a habeas
corpus application.  If neither the motion itself nor the federal judgment from
which it seeks relief substantively addresses federal grounds for setting aside
the movant's state conviction, allowing the motion to proceed as denominated
creates no inconsistency with the habeas statute or rules.  Petitioner's motion
in the present case, which alleges that the federal courts misapplied the
federal statute of limitations set out in § 2244(d), fits this description. 6

6  [***LEdHR2A]  Petitioner notes that we held in Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S.
473, 146 L. Ed. 2d 542, 120 S. Ct. 1595 (2000), that when a petition is
dismissed without prejudice as unexhausted, the refiled petition is not
""successive."" He argues that, by parity of reasoning, his Rule 60(b) motion
challenging the District Court dismissal of his petition on
statute-of-limitations grounds is not ""successive."" If this argument is correct,
petitioner would be able to file not just a Rule 60(b) motion, but a full-blown
habeas petition, without running afoul of § 2244(b).  But see, e.g.,  Murray v.
Greiner, 394 F.3d 78, 81 (CA2 2005).  We need not consider this contention,
however, because we conclude that petitioner's Rule 60(b) motion is not subject
to the limitations applicable to habeas petitions.

  [***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR7A]  Like the Court of Appeals, respondent relies
heavily on our decision in Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 140 L. Ed. 2d
728, 118 S. Ct. 1489 (1998).  In that case we [**2649]  reversed the Ninth
Circuit's decision to recall its mandate and reconsider the denial of Thompson's
first federal habeas petition; the recall was, we held, an abuse of discretion
because of its inconsistency with the policies embodied in AEDPA.  Id., at
554-559, 140 L. Ed. 2d 728, 118 S. Ct. 1489.  Analogizing an appellate court's
recall of its mandate to a district court's grant of relief from judgment, the
Eleventh Circuit thought that Calderon's disposition applied to Rule 60(b).  366
F.3d at 1272-1277.  We think otherwise.  To begin with, as the opinion said,
compliance with the actual text of AEDPA's  [*534]  successive-petition
provision was not at issue in Calderon--because the Court of Appeals considered
only the claims and evidence presented in Thompson's first federal habeas
petition.   [***494]   523 U.S., at 554, 140 L. Ed. 2d 728, 118 S. Ct. 1489.
Calderon did state, however, that  [HN17] ""a prisoner's motion to recall the
mandate on the basis of the merits of the underlying decision can be regarded as
a second or successive application.""  Id., at 553, 140 L. Ed. 2d 728, 118 S. Ct.
1489 (emphasis added).  But that is entirely consonant with the proposition that
a Rule 60(b) motion that seeks to revisit the federal court's denial on the
merits of a claim for relief should be treated as a successive habeas petition.
The problem for respondent is that this case does not present a revisitation of
the merits. The motion here, like some other Rule 60(b) motions in § 2254 cases,
confines itself not only to the first federal habeas petition, but to a
nonmerits aspect of the first federal habeas proceeding.  Nothing in Calderon
suggests that entertaining such a filing is ""inconsistent with"" AEDPA.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR9] [9]  [***LEdHR10] [10] Rule 60(b) has an
unquestionably valid role to play in habeas cases.  The Rule is often used to
relieve parties from the effect of a default judgment mistakenly entered against
them, e.g.,  Klapprott, 335 U.S., at 615, 93 L. Ed. 266, 69 S. Ct. 384 (opinion
of Black, J.), a function as legitimate in habeas cases as in run-of-the-mine
civil cases.  The Rule also preserves parties' opportunity to obtain vacatur of
a judgment that is void for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction--a consideration
just as valid in habeas cases as in any other, since absence of jurisdiction
altogether deprives a federal court of the power to adjudicate the rights of the
parties.  Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 94, 101,
140 L. Ed. 2d 210, 118 S. Ct. 1003 (1998).  In some instances, we may note, it
is the State, not the habeas petitioner, that seeks to use Rule 60(b), to reopen
a habeas judgment granting the writ.  See, e.g.,  Ritter v. Smith, 811 F.2d
1398, 1400 (CA11 1987).

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR11A]   [***LEdHR12] [12] Moreover, several
characteristics of a Rule 60(b) motion limit the friction between the Rule and
the successive-petition prohibitions of AEDPA, ensuring that our harmonization
of the two will not expose federal courts to an avalanche  [*535]  of frivolous
postjudgment motions.  First,  [HN18] Rule 60(b) contains its own limitations,
such as the requirement that the motion ""be made within a reasonable time"" and
the more specific 1-year deadline for asserting three of the most open-ended
grounds of relief (excusable neglect, newly discovered evidence, and fraud).
Second, our cases have  [HN19] required a movant seeking relief under Rule
60(b)(6) to show ""extraordinary circumstances"" justifying the reopening of a
final judgment.  Ackermann v. United States, 340 U.S. 193, 199, 95 L. Ed. 207,
71 S. Ct. 209 (1950); accord,   id., at 202, 95 L. Ed. 207, 71 S. Ct. 209;
Liljeberg, 486 U.S., at 864, 100 L. Ed. 2d 855, 108 S. Ct. 2194; id., at 873,
100 L. Ed. 2d 855, 108 S. Ct. 2194 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting) (""This very
strict interpretation of Rule 60(b) is essential if the finality of judgments is
to be preserved"").  Such circumstances will rarely occur in the habeas context.
Third,  [HN20] Rule 60(b) proceedings are subject to only limited and
deferential appellate review.  [**2650]   Browder v. Director, Dep't of
Corrections, 434 U.S. 257, 263, n 7, 54 L. Ed. 2d 521, 98 S. Ct. 556 (1978).
Many Courts of Appeals have construed 28 U.S.C. § 2253 to impose an additional
limitation on appellate review by requiring  [***495]  a habeas petitioner to
obtain a COA as a prerequisite to appealing the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion. 7

7 See Reid v. Angelone, 369 F.3d 363, 369, n 2 (CA4 2004) (citing cases); 366
F.3d 1253, 1263 (CA11 2004) (case below); cf. Langford v. Day, 134 F.3d 1381,
1382 (CA9 1998) (before AEDPA, a certificate of probable cause was a
prerequisite to appealing the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion in a habeas case);
Reid, supra, at 368 (same).  But see Dunn v. Cockrell, 302 F.3d 491, 492 (CA5
2002); 366 F.3d at 1298-1300 (Tjoflat, J., specially concurring in part and
dissenting in part).  Although we do not decide in this case whether this
construction of § 2253 is correct (the Eleventh Circuit granted petitioner a
COA), the COA requirement appears to be a more plausible and effective screening
requirement, with sounder basis in the statute, than the near-absolute bar
imposed here by the Court of Appeals.

  [***LEdHR2A]  Because petitioner's Rule 60(b) motion challenges only the
District Court's previous ruling on the AEDPA statute of limitations, it is not
the equivalent of a successive habeas  [*536]  petition. The Eleventh Circuit
therefore erred in holding that petitioner did not qualify even to seek Rule
60(b) relief.

III

[***LEdHR3A]  Although the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning is inconsistent with our
holding today, we nonetheless affirm its denial of petitioner's Rule 60(b)
motion.

[***LEdHR3A]   [***LEdHR11A]   [***LEdHR13] [13] Petitioner's only ground for
reopening the judgment denying his first federal habeas petition is that our
decision in Artuz showed the error of the District Court's
statute-of-limitations ruling.  We assume for present purposes that the District
Court's ruling was incorrect. 8 As we noted above, however, relief under Rule
60(b)(6) --the only subsection petitioner invokes--requires a showing of
""extraordinary circumstances."" Petitioner contends that Artuz's change in the
interpretation of the AEDPA statute of limitations meets this description.  We
do not agree.  The District Court's interpretation was by all appearances
correct under the Eleventh Circuit's then-prevailing interpretation of 28 U.S.C.
§ 2244 (d)(2).  It is hardly extraordinary that subsequently, after petitioner's
case was no longer pending, this Court arrived at a different interpretation.
[HN21] Although our constructions of federal statutes customarily apply to all
cases then pending on direct review, see, e.g.,  Harper v. Virginia Dep't of
Taxation, 509 U.S. 86, 97, 125 L. Ed. 2d 74, 113 S. Ct. 2510 (1993), not every
interpretation of the federal statutes setting forth the requirements for habeas
provides cause for reopening cases long since final. 9 If Artuz justified
reopening long-ago dismissals  [*537]  based on a lower court's unduly
parsimonious interpretation of § 2244(d)(2), then Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U.S.
408, 161 L. Ed. 2d 669, 125 S. Ct. 1807 (2005), would justify reopening long-ago
grants of habeas relief based on a lower court's unduly generous [**2651]
interpretation of the same tolling provision.

8 Although respondent contends that petitioner's motion for state postconviction
relief was untimely, and that the District Court's denial of statutory tolling
was therefore correct under Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U.S. 408, 161 L. Ed. 2d
669, 125 S. Ct. 1807 (2005), the Florida courts made no reference to
untimeliness in dismissing petitioner's motion.

9  [HN22] A change in the interpretation of a substantive statute may have
consequences for cases that have already reached final judgment, particularly in
the criminal context.  See Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 619-621, 140
L. Ed. 2d 828, 118 S. Ct. 1604 (1998); cf. Fiore v. White, 531 U.S. 225,
228-229, 148 L. Ed. 2d 629, 121 S. Ct. 712 (2001) (per curiam).

 [***LEdHR3A]  The change in the law worked  [***496]  by Artuz is all the less
extraordinary in petitioner's case, because of his lack of diligence in pursuing
review of the statute-of-limitations issue.  At the time Artuz was decided,
petitioner had abandoned any attempt to seek review of the District Court's
decision on this statute-of-limitations issue.  Although the District Court
relied on Eleventh Circuit precedent holding that a state postconviction
application is not ""properly filed"" if it is procedurally defaulted, and
although that precedent was at odds with the rule in several other Circuits,
petitioner neither raised that issue in his application for a COA, nor filed a
petition for rehearing of the Eleventh Circuit's denial of a COA, nor sought
certiorari review of that denial. 10 This lack of diligence confirms that Artuz
is not an extraordinary circumstance justifying relief from the judgment in
petitioner's case.  Indeed, in one of the cases in which we explained Rule
60(b)(6)'s extraordinary-circumstances requirement, the movant had failed to
appeal an adverse ruling by the District Court, whereas another party to the
same judgment had  [*538]  appealed and won reversal.  Ackermann, 340 U.S., at
195, 95 L. Ed. 207, 71 S. Ct. 209.  Some years later, the petitioner sought Rule
60(b) relief, which the District Court denied.  We affirmed the denial of Rule
60(b) relief, noting that the movant's decision not to appeal had been free and
voluntary, although the favorable ruling in the companion case made it appear
mistaken in hindsight.  See id., at 198, 95 L. Ed. 207, 71 S. Ct. 209.

10  [***LEdHR3A]  We granted review to resolve the conflict over the
interpretation of ""properly filed"" on April 17, 2000, only eight days after the
Eleventh Circuit denied petitioner a COA and well within the 90-day period in
which petitioner could have sought certiorari.  Artuz v. Bennett, 529 U.S. 1065,
146 L. Ed. 2d 479, 120 S. Ct. 1669.  Whether or not petitioner was aware that
the issue was pending before us, see post, at 544-545, n 7, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at
500-501 (Stevens, J., dissenting), it is indisputable that had he but filed a
petition raising the statute-of-limitations argument he now advances, we would
surely have granted him the reconsideration in light of Artuz v. Bennett, 531
U.S. 4, 121 S. Ct. 361, 148 L. Ed. 2d 213 (2000), that he later sought in his
Rule 60(b) motion.  See, e.g.,  Brown v. Moore, 532 U.S. 968, 149 L. Ed. 2d 464,
121 S. Ct. 1598 (2001) (granting a pro se petition for certiorari, vacating the
Eleventh Circuit's judgment denying a COA, and remanding for reconsideration in
light of Artuz, 531 U.S. 4, 121 S. Ct. 361, 148 L. Ed. 2d 213).

 [*447]   [**848] Per Curiam.

 [***LEdHR1A] [1A]  [***LEdHR2A] [2A] The United States Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit granted a writ of habeas corpus to respondent Gary Bradford Cone
after concluding that the ""especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel"" aggravating
circumstance found by the jury at the  [*448]  sentencing phase of his trial was
unconstitutionally vague, and that the Tennessee Supreme Court failed to cure
any constitutional deficiencies on appeal.   359 F.3d 785, 799 (2004).  Because
this result fails to accord to the state court the deference required by 28
U.S.C. § 2254(d)[28 USCS § 2254(d)], we grant the petition for certiorari and
respondent's  [**849] motion to proceed in forma pauperis and reverse.

Respondent killed Shipley Todd, 93, and his wife Cleopatra, 79, on August 10,
1980, in their home at the conclusion of a 2-day crime spree.  The killings were
accomplished in a brutal and callous fashion: The elderly victims were
""repeatedly beaten about the head until they died,""  State v. Cone, 665 S.W.2d
87, 90-91 (Tenn. 1984), and their bodies were subsequently discovered ""horribly
mutilated and cruelly beaten,""  id., at 90.  A Tennessee jury convicted
respondent of, inter alia, two counts of murder in the first degree and two
counts of murder in the first degree in the perpetration of a burglary.  At the
conclusion of the penalty phase of respondent's trial, the jury unanimously
found four aggravating circumstances 1 and concluded that they outweighed the
mitigating evidence.  Respondent was sentenced to death.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - Footnotes - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

1 The jury found the following aggravating circumstances: (1) respondent had
been convicted of one or more felonies involving the use or threat of violence
to a person, (2) the murders were ""especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel in
that they involved torture or depravity of mind,"" (3) respondent committed the
murders for the purpose of preventing a lawful arrest or prosecution, and (4)
respondent knowingly created a risk of death to two or more persons, other than
the victim murdered, during the murder. See  State v. Cone, 665 S.W.2d 87, 94-95
(Tenn. 1984).

 The Tennessee Supreme Court affirmed respondent's convictions and sentence.
Id., at 96.  As relevant here, the court held that three of the aggravating
circumstances found by the jury ""were clearly shown by the evidence.""  Id., at
[*449]  94. 2 With respect to the jury's finding that the murders were
""especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel,"" the court said:

2 The state court rejected the jury's finding that respondent ""'knowingly
created a great risk of death to two (2) or more persons, other than the victim
murdered, during his act of murder,'"" on the ground that the considerable threat
respondent posed to others earlier in the day was not sufficiently close in time
to the murders. Based on the strength of the other aggravating circumstances
before the jury, the court held this error to be ""harmless beyond a reasonable
doubt.""  Id., at 95.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -




     ""The jury also found that the murders in question were especially
     heinous, atrocious, or cruel in that they involved torture or
     depravity of mind as provided in [Tenn. Code Ann.] § 39-2-203(i)(5).
     The evidence abundantly established that both of the elderly victims
     had been brutally beaten to death by multiple crushing blows to the
     skulls.  Blood was spattered throughout the house, and both victims
     apparently had attempted to resist, because numerous defensive wounds
     were found on their  [***888]  persons.  The only excuse offered in
     the entire record for this unspeakably brutal conduct by the accused
     was that these elderly victims had at some point ceased to 'cooperate'
     with him in his ransacking of their home and in his effort to flee
     from arrest.  As previously stated, it was stipulated by counsel for
     [respondent]  that there was no issue of self-defense even remotely
     suggested.  The deaths of the victims were not instantaneous, and
     obviously one had to be killed before the other.  The terror, fright
     and horror that these elderly helpless citizens must have endured was
     certainly something that the jury could have taken into account in
     finding this aggravating circumstance.""  Id., at 94-95.



Respondent twice sought relief from his conviction and sentence in collateral
proceedings in state court, to no avail.  In his second amended petition for
postconviction relief, respondent raised 52 independent claims of constitutional
[*450]  error, including [**850]  a contention that the ""especially heinous,
atrocious, or cruel"" aggravating circumstance was unconstitutionally vague under
the Eighth Amendment.  The state trial court held each of respondent's claims
barred by Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-111 (1990), which limited the grounds that may
be raised on collateral review to those not waived or previously determined in
previous proceedings.  The trial court explained that respondent's
constitutional challenge to the ""heinous, atrocious, or cruel"" aggravating
circumstance, along with many other claims, was ""clearly [a] re-statemen[t] of
previous grounds heretofore determined and denied by the Tennessee Supreme Court
upon Direct Appeal or the Court of Criminal Appeals upon the First Petition.""
Cone v. State, No. P-06874 (Tenn. Crim. Ct., Dec. 16, 1993), p. 6. The Tennessee
Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the denial of relief on all grounds.   Cone
v. State, 927 S.W.2d 579, 582 (1995).  The State Supreme Court denied respondent
permission to appeal.

II

[***LEdHR1A] [1B] In 1997, respondent sought a writ of habeas corpus under 28
U.S.C. § 2254 [28 USCS § 2254] in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Tennessee, again asserting a multitude of claims.  The
District Court denied relief; it held respondent's vagueness challenge to the
""especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel"" aggravating circumstance to be
procedurally barred by respondent's failure to raise it on direct appeal in
state court.  The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit subsequently held that
respondent was entitled to relief on another ground and did not consider
respondent's challenges to the aggravating circumstances found by the jury.
Cone v. Bell, 243 F.3d 961, 975 (2001).  We reversed that judgment.   Bell v.
Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 702, 152 L. Ed. 2d 914, 122 S. Ct. 1843 (2002).

[***LEdHR1A] [1C]  [***LEdHR3A] [3A] On remand, the same panel of the Sixth
Circuit again granted respondent a writ of habeas corpus, this time with one
judge dissenting, on the ground that the ""especially heinous,  [*451]
atrocious, or cruel"" aggravator was unconstitutionally vague under the Eighth
Amendment.  The court first rejected petitioner's argument that respondent
procedurally defaulted the claim in state court.  Based on its understanding of
state law, the court concluded that the  [***889]  State Supreme Court's
statutorily mandated review of each death sentence, see Tenn. Code Ann. §
39-2-205(c)(1) (1982), necessarily included the consideration of constitutional
deficiencies in the aggravating circumstances found by the jury and therefore
that the issue was ""fairly presented"" to the state court, even if respondent did
not raise it himself. 3   359  [**851] F.3d, at 791-793.  Judge Norris dissented
on this point.   Id., at 806.

3  [***LEdHR1A] [1D]  [***LEdHR3A] [3B] Petitioner argues that the Sixth
Circuit's conclusion in this regard is in tension with the decisions of other
Courts of Appeals, which have held that a petitioner must raise his
constitutional claim in state court in order to preserve it, notwithstanding the
existence of a mandatory-review statute.  See  Mu'min v. Pruett, 125 F.3d 192,
197 (CA4 1997) ( Virginia); Martinez-Villareal v. Lewis, 80 F.3d 1301, 1306 (CA9
1996) ( Arizona); Kornahrens v. Evatt, 66 F.3d 1350, 1362 (CA4 1995) ( South
Carolina); Nave v. Delo, 62 F.3d 1024, 1039 (CA8 1995) ( Missouri); Julius v.
Johnson, 840 F.2d 1533, 1546 (CA11 1988) (Alabama).  We find it unnecessary to
express a view on this point.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(2) [28 USCS § 2254(b)(2)]
(an application for habeas corpus may be denied on the merits, notwithstanding a
petitioner's failure to exhaust in state court).  We do emphasize that, as a
general matter, the burden is on the petitioner to raise his federal claim in
the state courts at a time when state procedural law permits its consideration
on the merits, even if the state court could have identified and addressed the
federal question without its having been raised.  See  Baldwin v. Reese, 541
U.S. 27, 30-32, 158 L. Ed. 2d 64, 124 S. Ct. 1347 (2004).

  [***LEdHR1A] [1E] Turning to the merits, the Sixth Circuit held that the state
court's affirmance of respondent's sentence in light of the ""especially heinous,
atrocious, or cruel"" aggravating circumstance was ""contrary to"" the clearly
established principles set forth in our decision in  Godfrey v. Georgia, 446
U.S. 420, 64 L. Ed. 2d 398, 100 S. Ct. 1759 (1980).  The Court of Appeals
allowed that ""[n]o Supreme Court case has addressed the precise language at
issue,""  359 F.3d at 795, and that no ""Supreme Court decisio[n] is 'on all
[*452]  fours' with the instruction in Cone's case,"" 4 id., at 796, but
nevertheless concluded, in light of Godfrey and the series of cases that
followed it,  Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U.S. 356, 100 L. Ed. 2d 372, 108 S. Ct.
1853 (1988),  Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S 639, 111 L. Ed. 2d 511, 110 S. Ct.
3047 (1990), and  Shell v. Mississippi, 498 U.S. 1, 112 L. Ed. 2d 1, 111 S. Ct.
313 (1990) (per curiam), that federal law dictated the conclusion that the
State's ""especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel"" aggravator was
unconstitutionally vague. 5  359 F.3d at 797.  Lastly, the court rejected
petitioner's argument that the Tennessee Supreme Court cured any deficiency in
the aggravating circumstance on direct appeal by reviewing the jury's finding
under the narrowed construction of the aggravator  [***890]  that it adopted in
State v. Dicks, 615 S.W.2d 126 (1981).   359 F.3d at 797.

4 The jury was instructed with respect to this aggravated circumstance as
follows:

""'Heinous' means extremely wicked or shockingly evil.

""Atrocious' means outrageously wicked and vile.

""Cruel' means designed to inflict a high degree of pain, utter indifference to,
or enjoyment of, the suffering of others, pitiless.""  359 F.3d at 794.

5

[***LEdHR1A] [1F] The court recognized that these cases postdated the Tennessee
Supreme Court's 1984 decision on direct appeal, but, relying on  Stringer v.
Black, 503 U.S. 222, 225, 117 L. Ed. 2d 367, 112 S. Ct. 1130 (1992) (which held
that Cartwright did not announce a ""new rule"" of constitutional law because its
resolution was dictated by Godfrey), concluded that these later cases were ""not
only material, but controlling"" and required the conclusion that Tennessee's
""heinous, atrocious, or cruel"" aggravating circumstance was unconstitutionally
vague on its face.   359 F.3d at 795.  We assume, without deciding, that the
Court of Appeals was correct in this conclusion.

 III

[***LEdHR4] [4]   [HN1] A federal court may grant a writ of habeas corpus based
on a claim adjudicated by a state court if the state-court decision ""was
contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established
Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States."" 28 U.S.C.
§ 2254(d)(1) [28 USCS § 2254(d)(1)].  A state court's decision is ""contrary to .
. . clearly established Federal law"" ""if the state court applies a  [*453]  rule
that contradicts the governing law set forth in our cases,"" or ""if the state
court confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant
Supreme Court precedent and arrives at a result opposite to ours.""  Williams v.
Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 405, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389, 120 S. Ct. 1495 (2000).

[***LEdHR1A] [1G] The law governing vagueness challenges to statutory
aggravating circumstances was summarized aptly in  Walton, supra, overruled on
other grounds,  Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, 153 L. Ed. 2d 556, 122 S. Ct.
2428 (2002):


      [HN2] ""When a federal court is asked to review a state court's
     application of an individual statutory aggravating or mitigating
     circumstance in a particular case, it must first determine whether the
     statutory [**852]  language defining the circumstance is itself too
     vague to provide any guidance to the sentencer.  If so, then the
     federal court must attempt to determine whether the state courts have
     further defined the vague terms and, if they have done so, whether
     those definitions are constitutionally sufficient, i.e., whether they
     provide some guidance to the sentencer.""  Walton, supra, at 654, 111
     L. Ed. 511, 110 S. Ct. 3047.



These principles were plain enough at the time the State Supreme Court decided
respondent's appeal.  In  Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U.S. 242, 49 L. Ed. 2d 913,
96 S. Ct. 2960 (1976), we upheld the aggravating circumstance that the murder
was ""'especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel'"" on the express ground that a
narrowing construction had been adopted by that State's Supreme Court.   Id., at
255, 49 L. Ed. 2d 913, 96 S. Ct. 2960 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and
Stevens, JJ.).  And, in  Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 49 L. Ed. 2d 859, 96 S.
Ct. 2909 (1976), we refused to invalidate the aggravating circumstance that the
murder was ""'outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it
involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim,'""
because ""there [was] no reason to assume that the Supreme Court of Georgia will
adopt . . . an open-ended construction"" that is potentially applicable to any
murder.  Id., at 201, 49 L. Ed. 2d 859, 96 S. Ct. 2909 (joint opinion of  [*454]
Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).  See generally  Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U.S.
764, 774-777, 111 L. Ed. 2d 606, 110 S. Ct. 3092 (1990) (reviewing cases).

[***LEdHR1A] [1H]  [***LEdHR5A] [5A] Indeed, in  Godfrey, 446 U.S. 420, 64 L.
Ed. 2d 398, 100 S. Ct. 1759, the case on which the Court of Appeals relied in
declaring the aggravating circumstance to be unconstitutionally vague, the
controlling plurality opinion followed precisely this procedure.  Like the court
below, the plurality looked first to the language of the aggravating
circumstance found by the jury and concluded  [***891]  that there was ""nothing
in these few words, standing alone, that implies any inherent restraint on the
arbitrary and capricious infliction of the death sentence.""  Id., at 428, 64 L.
Ed. 2d 398, 100 S. Ct. 1759.  But the plurality did not stop there: It next
evaluated whether the Georgia Supreme Court ""applied a constitutional
construction"" of the aggravating circumstance on appeal.   Id., at 432, 64 L.
Ed. 2d 398, 100 S. Ct. 1759.  Because the facts of the case did not resemble
those in which the state court had previously applied a narrower construction of
the aggravating circumstance and because the state court gave no explanation for
its decision other than to say that the verdict was ""'factually substantiated,'""
the plurality concluded that it did not.   Id., 432-433, 64 L. Ed. 2d 398, 100
S. Ct. 1759.  As we have subsequently explained, this conclusion was the
linchpin of the Court's holding: ""Had the Georgia Supreme Court applied a
narrowing construction of the aggravator, we would have rejected the Eighth
Amendment challenge to Godfrey's death sentence, notwithstanding the failure to
instruct the jury on that narrowing construction.""  Lambrix v. Singletary, 520
U.S. 518, 531, 137 L. Ed. 2d 771, 117 S. Ct. 1517 (1997).  See also  Walton,
supra, at 653-654, 111 L. Ed. 2d 511, 110 S. Ct. 3047;  Cartwright, supra, at
363-365, 100 L. Ed. 2d 372, 108 S. Ct. 1853 (refusing to countenance the
Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals' affirmance of a death sentence based on a
facially vague aggravating circumstance where that court had not adopted a
narrowing construction of its aggravator when it affirmed the prisoner's
sentence). 6

[***LEdHR5A] [5B] In  Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, 153 L. Ed. 2d 556, 122 S.
Ct. 2428 (2002), we held that the Sixth Amendment requires a jury, rather than a
judge, to find the aggravating circumstance that renders a defendant
death-eligible.   Id., at 609, 153 L. Ed. 2d 556, 122 S. Ct. 2428.  Because Ring
does not apply retroactively,  Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U.S. 348, 358, 159 L.
Ed. 2d 442, 124 S. Ct. 2519, 2004 U.S. LEXIS 4574 (2004), this case does not
present the question whether an appellate court may, consistently with Ring,
cure the finding of a vague aggravating circumstance by applying a narrower
construction.

  [***LEdHR1A] [1I]  [**853]   [*455]  In this case, however, the Sixth Circuit
rejected the possibility that the Tennessee Supreme Court cured any error in the
jury instruction by applying a narrowing construction of the statutory ""heinous,
atrocious, or cruel"" aggravator. The court asserted that the State Supreme Court
""did not apply, or even mention, any narrowing interpretation or cite to [sic]
Dicks,"" the case in which the State Supreme Court had adopted a narrowing
construction of the aggravating circumstance.  359 F.3d at 797.  ""Instead,"" the
court said, ""the [state] court simply, but explicitly, satisfied itself that the
labels 'heinous, atrocious, or cruel,' without more, applied to [respondent's]
crime."" Ibid.

[***LEdHR1A] [1J]  [***LEdHR6] [6] We do not think that a federal court can
presume so lightly that a state court failed to apply its own law.  As we have
said before,  [HN3] § 2254(d) dictates a ""'highly deferential standard for
evaluating state-court rulings,'  Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 333, n. 7, 138
L. Ed. 2d 481, 117 S. Ct. 2059 (1997), which demands that state-court decisions
be given the benefit of the doubt.""  Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U.S. 19, 24, 154
L. Ed. 2d 279, 123 S. Ct. 357 (2002) (per curiam). To the extent that the Court
of Appeals rested its decision on the state court's failure to cite Dicks, it
was mistaken.   [HN4] Federal courts are not free to presume that a state court
did  [***892]  not comply with constitutional dictates on the basis of nothing
more than a lack of citation.  See  Mitchell v. Esparza, 540 U.S. 12, 16, 157 L.
Ed. 2d 263, 124 S. Ct. 7 (2003) (per curiam);  Early v. Packer, 537 U.S. 3, 8,
154 L. Ed. 2d 263, 123 S. Ct. 362 (2002) (per curiam).

[***LEdHR1A] [1K]  [***LEdHR7] [7] More importantly, however, we find no basis
for the Court of Appeals' statement that the state court ""simply, but
explicitly, satisfied itself that the labels 'heinous, atrocious, or cruel,'
without more, applied"" to the murder.  359 F.3d at 797.  The state court's
opinion does not disclaim application of that court's established construction
of the aggravating  [*456]  circumstance; the only thing that it states
""explicitly"" is that the evidence in this case supported the jury's finding of
the statutory aggravator. See  Cone, 665 S.W.2d, at 95 (stating that the
aggravating circumstance was ""indisputably established by the record"").  As we
explain below, the State Supreme Court had construed the aggravating
circumstance narrowly and had followed that precedent numerous times; absent an
affirmative indication to the contrary, we must presume that it did the same
thing here.  See  Visciotti, supra, at 24, 154 L. Ed. 2d 279, 123 S. Ct. 357
(stating the presumption that state courts ""know and follow the law"");  Lambrix,
supra, at 532, n. 4, 137 L. Ed. 2d 771, 117 S. Ct. 1517;  Walton, 497 U.S., at
653, 111 L. Ed. 511, 110 S. Ct. 3047.  That is especially true in a case such as
this one, where the state court has recognized that its narrowing construction
is constitutionally compelled and has affirmatively assumed the responsibility
to ensure that the aggravating circumstance is applied constitutionally in each
case.  See  State v. Pritchett, 621 S.W.2d 127, 139, 140 (Tenn. 1981).

[***LEdHR1A] [1L] Even absent such a presumption in the state court's favor,
however, we would still conclude in this case that the state court applied the
narrower construction of the ""heinous, atrocious, or cruel"" aggravating
circumstance. The State Supreme [**854]  Court's reasoning in this case closely
tracked its rationale for affirming the death sentences in other cases in which
it expressly applied a narrowed construction of the same ""heinous, atrocious, or
cruel"" aggravator. Accord,  Godfrey, supra, at 432, 64 L. Ed. 2d 398, 100 S. Ct.
1759 (holding that ""[t]he circumstances of this case . . . do not satisfy the
criteria [for torture] laid out by the Georgia Supreme Court itself"" in its
cases construing the aggravating circumstance).  The facts the court relied on
to affirm the jury's verdict--that the elderly victims attempted to resist, that
their deaths were not instantaneous, that respondent's actions toward them were
""unspeakably brutal,"" and that they endured ""terror, fright and horror"" before
being killed,  665 S.W.2d, at 95 --match, almost exactly, the reasons the state
court gave when it held the evidence in  State v. Melson, 638 S.W.2d 342, 367
(Tenn.  [*457]  1982), to be sufficient to satisfy the torture prong of the
narrowed ""heinous, atrocious, or cruel"" aggravating circumstance. See also
Pritchett, supra, at 139 (finding the evidence to be insufficient to satisfy a
narrowed construction of the aggravator where the victim's death was
""instantaneous"");  State v. Campbell, 664 S.W.2d 281, 284 (Tenn. 1984) (holding
that evidence of the aggravator was ""overwhelming"" where an elderly murder
victim was beaten to death with a blunt object and his hands  [***893]  showed
that he had attempted to defend himself).  Similarly, the state court's findings
that respondent's victims had been ""brutally beaten to death by multiple
crushing blows to the skulls,"" that ""[b]lood was spattered throughout the
house,"" and that the victims were helpless,  665 S.W.2d, at 94-95, accord with
the reasons that the state court had previously found sufficient to support
findings of depravity of mind.  See  Melson, supra, at 367;  State v. Groseclose
, 615 S.W.2d 142, 151 (Tenn. 1981);  Strouth v. State, 999 S.W.2d 759, 766
(Tenn. 1999).  In sum, a review of the state court's previous decisions
interpreting and applying the narrowed construction of the ""heinous, atrocious,
or cruel"" aggravator leaves little doubt that the State Supreme Court applied
that same construction in respondent's case. 7

7  [***LEdHR1A] [1M] We find additional support for this conclusion in the fact
that respondent's argument to the State Supreme Court relied squarely on a case
in which that court had expressly formulated its narrowing construction of the
aggravating circumstance and had applied that construction to the benefit of the
defendant.  See Brief for Appellant in No. 02C019403CR00052 (Sup Ct Tenn 1983),
p 20 (arguing, based on  State v. Pritchett, 621 S.W.2d 127 (Tenn. 1981), that
""the State did not show . . . that the victims suffered"").  Likewise, the two
cases the State relied upon in response to respondent's argument also expressly
applied a narrowing construction of the ""heinous, atrocious, or cruel""
aggravator. See Brief for Appellee in No. 02C019403CR00052 (Sup Ct Tenn 1983), p
34 (citing  Pritchett, supra, and  State v. Melson, 638 S.W.2d 342, 367 (Tenn.
1982)).

  [***LEdHR1A] [1N]  [***LEdHR8A] [8A] The only remaining question is whether
the narrowing construction that the Tennessee Supreme Court applied was  [*458]
itself unconstitutionally vague. See  Walton, supra, at 654, 111 L. Ed. 511, 110
S. Ct. 3047;  Godfrey, 446 U.S., at 428, 64 L. Ed. 2d 398, 100 S. Ct. 1759.  It
was not.  In  State v. Dicks, 615 S.W.2d 126 (Tenn. 1981), the state court
adopted the exact construction of the aggravator that we approved in  Proffitt,
428 U.S., at 255, 49 L. Ed. 2d 913, 96 S. Ct. 2960: that the aggravator was
""directed at 'the conscienceless or pitiless crime which is unnecessarily
torturous to the victim,'""  Dicks, supra, at 132.  See also  Sochor v. Florida,
504 U.S. 527, 536, 119 L. Ed. 2d 326, 112 S. Ct. 2114 (1992).  In light of
Proffitt we think this interpretation of the aggravator, standing alone, would
be sufficient to overcome the claim that the aggravating circumstance applied
[**855]  by the state court was ""contrary to"" clearly established federal law
under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) [28 USCS § 2254(d)(1)].

The State Supreme Court's subsequent application of this aggravating
circumstance, as construed in Dicks, stands as further proof that it could be
applied meaningfully to narrow the class of death-eligible offenders.  Later in
the year that Dicks was decided, the court elaborated on the meaning of the
aggravator:


     ""Although the Tennessee aggravating circumstances [sic] [that the
     murder was heinous, atrocious, or cruel] does not contain the phrase,
     'an aggravated battery to the victim' it is clear that a
     constitutional construction of this aggravating circumstance requires
     evidence that the defendant inflicted torture on the victim before
     death or that [the] defendant committed acts evincing a depraved state
     of mind; that the depraved state of mind or the torture inflicted must
     meet the test of heinous, atrocious, or cruel.""  Pritchett,  [***894]
     621 S.W.2d, at 139 (citation omitted).



With respect to the meaning of ""torture,"" the court held that the aggravator was
not satisfied where the victim dies instantly, ibid., but that it was where ""the
uncontradicted proof shows that [the victim] had defensive injuries to her arms
and hands, proving that there was time for her to realize  [*459]  what was
happening, to feel fear, and to try to protect herself,""  Melson, supra, at 367.
Accord,  Cartwright, 486 U.S., at 364-365, 100 L. Ed. 2d 372, 108 S. Ct. 1853
(approving the limitation of the ""heinous, atrocious, or cruel"" aggravating
circumstance to killings in which the victim suffered ""some kind of torture or
serious physical abuse"" prior to the murder).  As to ""depravity of mind,"" the
court held the fact that the defendant fired a second shotgun blast into a
victim after he was dead to be insufficient as a matter of law, see  Pritchett,
supra, at 139,  (explaining that the depravity in such an action falls short of
that exhibited by the defendant in  Godfrey, supra), but concluded that, ""a
killing wherein the victim is struck up to thirty times, causing an entire room
to be covered with a spray of flying blood, and causing the victim's brains to
extrude through the gaping hole in her skull,"" sufficed,  Melson, 638 S.W.2d, at
367. 8 In light of these holdings, we are satisfied that the State's aggravating
circumstance, as construed by the Tennessee Supreme Court, ensured that there
was a ""principled basis"" for distinguishing between those cases in which the
death penalty was assessed and those cases in which it was not.   Arave v.
Creech, 507 U.S. 463, 474, 123 L. Ed. 2d 188, 113 S. Ct. 1534 (1993).

circumstance);  Strouth v. State, 999 S.W.2d 759, 766 (Tenn. 1999) (quoting the

mind"" in that it was ""cold-blooded, intentional, conscienceless and pitiless"");

  [***LEdHR1A] [1O]  [***LEdHR2A] [2B]  [***LEdHR8A] [8B] In sum, even assuming
that the Court of Appeals was correct to conclude that the State's statutory
aggravating circumstance was facially vague, the court erred in presuming that
the State Supreme Court failed to cure this vagueness by applying a narrowing
construction on direct appeal. The state court did apply such a narrowing
construction, and that  [*460]  construction satisfied constitutional demands by
ensuring that respondent was not sentenced to death in an arbitrary or
capricious manner.  See  Godfrey, supra, at 428, 64 L. Ed. 2d 398, 100 S. Ct.
1759.  The state court's affirmance of respondent's  [**856] sentence on this
ground was therefore not ""contrary to . . . clearly established Federal law,"" 28
U.S.C. § 22"
"                DARIN L. MUEHLER, et al., Petitioners v. IRIS MENA",544 U.S. 93,"

 [*95]  [**1468]   Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A]  [***LEdHR2A] [2A] Respondent Iris Mena was detained in
handcuffs during a search of the premises that she and several others occupied.
Petitioners were lead members of a police detachment executing a search warrant
of these premises.  She sued the officers under Rev Stat § 1979, 42 U.S.C. §
1983 [42 USCS § 1983], and the District Court found in her favor.  The Court of
Appeals affirmed the judgment, holding that the use of handcuffs to detain Mena
during the search violated the Fourth Amendment and that the officers'
questioning of Mena about her immigration status during the detention
constituted an independent Fourth Amendment violation.   Mena v. Simi Valley,
332 F.3d 1255 (CA9 2003).  We hold that Mena's detention in handcuffs for the
length of the search was consistent with our opinion in  Michigan v. Summers,
452 U.S. 692, 69 L. Ed. 2d 340, 101 S. Ct. 2587 (1981), and that the officers'
questioning during that detention did not violate her Fourth Amendment rights.


     * * *



Based on information gleaned from the investigation of a gang-related, driveby
shooting, petitioners Muehler and Brill had reason to believe at least one
member of a gang--the West Side Locos--lived at 1363 Patricia Avenue.  They also
suspected that the individual was armed and dangerous, since he had recently
been involved in the driveby shooting.  As a result, Muehler obtained a search
warrant for 1363 Patricia Avenue that authorized a broad search of the house and
premises for, among other things, deadly weapons and  [*96]  evidence of gang
membership.  In light of the high degree of risk involved in searching a house
suspected of housing at least one, and perhaps multiple, armed gang members, a
Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team was used to secure the residence and
grounds before the search.

At 7 a.m. on February 3, 1998, petitioners, along with the SWAT team and other
officers, executed the warrant.  Mena was asleep in her bed when the SWAT team,
clad in helmets and black vests adorned with badges and the word ""POLICE,""
entered her bedroom and placed her in handcuffs at gunpoint.  The SWAT team also
handcuffed three other individuals found on the property.  The SWAT team then
took those individuals and Mena into a converted garage, which contained several
beds and some other bedroom furniture.  While the search proceeded, one or two
officers guarded the four detainees, who were allowed to move around the garage
but remained in handcuffs.

Aware that the West Side Locos gang was composed primarily of illegal
immigrants, the officers had notified the Immigration and Naturalization Service
(INS) that they would be conducting the search, and an INS officer accompanied
the officers executing the warrant.  During their detention in the garage, an
officer asked for each detainee's name, date of birth, place of birth, and
immigration status. The INS officer later asked the detainees for their
immigration documentation.  Mena's status as a permanent resident was confirmed
by her papers.

[**1469]  The search of the premises yielded  [***306]  a .22 caliber handgun
with .22 caliber ammunition, a box of .25 caliber ammunition, several baseball
bats with gang writing, various additional gang paraphernalia, and a bag of
marijuana.  Before the officers left the area, Mena was released.

In her § 1983 suit against the officers she alleged that she was detained ""for
an unreasonable time and in an unreasonable manner"" in violation of the Fourth
Amendment.  App.  [*97]  19.  In addition, she claimed that the warrant and its
execution were overbroad, that the officers failed to comply with the ""knock and
announce"" rule, and that the officers had needlessly destroyed property during
the search.  The officers moved for summary judgment, asserting that they were
entitled to qualified immunity, but the District Court denied their motion.  The
Court of Appeals affirmed that denial, except for Mena's claim that the warrant
was overbroad; on this claim the Court of Appeals held that the officers were
entitled to qualified immunity.  Mena v. Simi Valley, 226 F.3d 1031 (CA9 2000).
After a trial, a jury, pursuant to a special verdict form, found that Officers
Muehler and Brill violated Mena's Fourth Amendment right to be free from
unreasonable seizures by detaining her both with force greater than that which
was reasonable and for a longer period than that which was reasonable.  The jury
awarded Mena $10,000 in actual damages and $20,000 in punitive damages against
each petitioner for a total of $60,000.

The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment on two grounds.   332 F.3d 1255 (CA9
2003).  Reviewing the denial of qualified immunity de novo,  id., at 1261, n. 2,
it first held that the officers' detention of Mena violated the Fourth Amendment
because it was objectively unreasonable to confine her in the converted garage
and keep her in handcuffs during the search,  id., at 1263-1264.  In the Court
of Appeals' view, the officers should have released Mena as soon as it became
clear that she posed no immediate threat.   Id., at 1263.  The court
additionally held that the questioning of Mena about her immigration status
constituted an independent Fourth Amendment violation.   Id., at 1264-1266.  The
Court of Appeals went on to hold that those rights were clearly established at
the time of Mena's questioning, and thus the officers were not entitled to
qualified immunity.  Id., at 1266-1267.  We granted certiorari,  542 U.S. 903,
159 L. Ed. 2d 266, 124 S. Ct. 2842 (2004), and now vacate and remand.

 [*98]   [***LEdHR1A] [1B] In  Michigan v. Summers, 452 U.S. 692, 69 L. Ed. 2d
340, 101 S. Ct. 2587 (1981), we held that  [HN1] officers executing a search
warrant for contraband have the authority ""to detain the occupants of the
premises while a proper search is conducted.""  Id., at 705, 69 L. Ed. 2d 340,
101 S. Ct. 2587.  Such detentions are appropriate, we explained, because the
character of the additional intrusion caused by detention is slight and because
the justifications for detention are substantial.   Id., at 701-705, 69 L. Ed.
2d 340, 101 S. Ct. 2587.  We made clear that the detention of an occupant is
""surely less intrusive than the search itself,"" and the presence of a warrant
assures that a neutral magistrate has determined that probable cause exists to
search the home.   Id., at 701, 69 L. Ed. 2d 340, 101 S. Ct. 2587.  Against this
incremental intrusion, we posited three legitimate law enforcement interests
that provide substantial  [***307]  justification for detaining an occupant:
""preventing flight in the event that incriminating evidence is found"";
""minimizing the risk of harm to the officers""; and facilitating ""the orderly
completion of the search,"" as detainees' ""self-interest may induce them to open
locked doors or locked containers to avoid [**1470]  the use of force.""  Id., at
702-703, 69 L. Ed. 2d 340, 101 S. Ct. 2587.

[***LEdHR1A] [1C]  [***LEdHR3A] [3A] Mena's detention was, under Summers,
plainly permissible. 1  [HN2] An officer's authority to detain incident to a
search is categorical; it does not depend on the ""quantum of proof justifying
detention or the extent of the intrusion to be imposed by the seizure.""  Id., at
705, n. 19, 69 L. Ed. 2d 340, 101 S. Ct. 2587.  Thus, Mena's detention for the
duration of the search was reasonable under Summers because a warrant existed to
search 1363 Patricia Avenue and she was an occupant of that address at the time
of the search.

[***LEdHR3A] [3B]  [HN3] In determining whether a Fourth Amendment violation
occurred we draw all reasonable factual inferences in favor of the jury verdict,
but as we made clear in  Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 697-699, 134 L.
Ed. 2d 911, 116 S. Ct. 1657 (1996), we do not defer to the jury's legal
conclusion that those facts violate the Constitution.

 [HN4] Inherent in Summers' authorization to detain an occupant of the place to
be searched is the authority to use reasonable  [*99]  force to effectuate the
detention. See  Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 396, 104 L. Ed. 2d 443, 109 S.
Ct. 1865 (1989)  [HN5] (""Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has long recognized that
the right to make an arrest or investigatory stop necessarily carries with it
the right to use some degree of physical coercion or threat thereof to effect
it"").  Indeed, Summers itself stressed that the risk of harm to officers and
occupants is minimized ""if the officers routinely exercise unquestioned command
of the situation.""  452 U.S., at 703, 69 L. Ed. 2d 340, 101 S. Ct. 2587.

[***LEdHR1A] [1D]  [***LEdHR4] [4]  [***LEdHR5A] [5A] The officers' use of force
in the form of handcuffs to effectuate Mena's detention in the garage, as well
as the detention of the three other occupants, was reasonable because the
governmental interests outweigh the marginal intrusion. See  Graham, supra, at
396-397, 104 L. Ed. 2d 443, 109 S. Ct. 1865.  The imposition of correctly
applied handcuffs on Mena, who was already being lawfully detained during a
search of the house, was undoubtedly a separate intrusion in addition to
detention in the converted garage. 2 The detention was thus more intrusive than
that which we upheld in Summers. See  452 U.S., at 701-702, 69 L. Ed. 2d 340,
101 S. Ct. 2587 (concluding that the additional intrusion in the form of a
detention was less than that of the  [***308]  warrant-sanctioned search);
Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U.S. 408, 413-414, 137 L. Ed. 2d 41, 117 S. Ct. 882
(1997) (concluding [*100]  that the additional intrusion from ordering
passengers out of a car, which was already stopped, was minimal).

2  [***LEdHR5A] [5B] In finding the officers should have released Mena from the
handcuffs, the Court of Appeals improperly relied upon the fact that the warrant
did not include Mena as a suspect.  See  Mena v. Simi Valley, 332 F.3d 1255,
1263, n. 5 (CA9 2003).  The warrant was concerned not with individuals but with
locations and property.  In particular, the warrant in this case authorized the
search of 1363 Patricia Avenue and its surrounding grounds for, among other
things, deadly weapons and evidence of street gang membership.  In this respect,
the warrant here resembles that at issue in  Michigan v. Summers, 452 U.S. 692,
69 L. Ed. 2d 340, 101 S. Ct. 2587 (1981), which allowed the search of a
residence for drugs without mentioning any individual, including the owner of
the home whom police ultimately arrested.  See  People v. Summers, 407 Mich.
432, 440-443, 286 N.W.2d 226, 226-227 (1979), rev'd,  Michigan v. Summers,
supra. Summers makes clear that when a neutral magistrate has determined police
have probable cause to believe contraband exists, ""[t]he connection of an
occupant to [a] home"" alone ""justifies a detention of that occupant.""  452 U.S.,
at 703-704, 69 L. Ed. 2d 340, 101 S. Ct. 2587.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  [***LEdHR1A] [1E] But this was no ordinary search.  The governmental interests
in not only detaining, but using handcuffs, are at their maximum when, as here,
a warrant authorizes a [**1471]  search for weapons and a wanted gang member
resides on the premises.  In such inherently dangerous situations, the use of
handcuffs minimizes the risk of harm to both officers and occupants. Cf.
Summers, supra, at 702-703, 69 L. Ed. 2d 340, 101 S. Ct. 2587 (recognizing the
execution of a warrant to search for drugs ""may give rise to sudden violence or
frantic efforts to conceal or destroy evidence"").  Though this safety risk
inherent in executing a search warrant for weapons was sufficient to justify the
use of handcuffs, the need to detain multiple occupants made the use of
handcuffs all the more reasonable.  Cf.  Maryland v. Wilson, supra, at 414, 137
L. Ed. 2d 41, 117 S. Ct. 882 (noting that ""danger to an officer from a traffic
stop is likely to be greater when there are passengers in addition to the driver
in the stopped car"").

[***LEdHR1A] [1F]  [***LEdHR6] [6] Mena argues that, even if the use of
handcuffs to detain her in the garage was reasonable as an initial matter, the
duration of the use of handcuffs made the detention unreasonable.   [HN6] The
duration of a detention can, of course,  affect the balance of interests under
Graham. However, the 2- to 3-hour detention in handcuffs in this case does not
outweigh the government's continuing safety interests.  As we have noted, this
case involved the detention of four detainees by two officers during a search of
a gang house for dangerous weapons. We conclude that the detention of Mena in
handcuffs during the search was reasonable.

[***LEdHR2A] [2B] The Court of Appeals also determined that the officers
violated Mena's Fourth Amendment rights by questioning her about her immigration
status during the detention.  332 F.3d, at 1264-1266.  This holding, it appears,
was premised on the assumption that the officers were required to have
independent reasonable suspicion in order to question Mena concerning her
immigration status because the questioning  [*101]  constituted a discrete
Fourth Amendment event.  But the premise is faulty.  We have ""held repeatedly
that  [HN7] mere police questioning does not constitute a seizure.""  Florida v.
Bostick, 501 U.S. 429, 434, 115 L. Ed. 2d 389, 111 S. Ct. 2382 (1991); see also
INS v. Delgado, 466 U.S. 210, 212, 80 L. Ed. 2d 247, 104 S. Ct. 1758 (1984).
""[E]ven when officers have no basis for suspecting a particular individual, they
may generally ask questions of that individual; ask to examine the individual's
identification; and request consent to search his or her luggage.""  Bostick,
supra, at 434-435, 115 L. Ed. 2d 389, 111 S. Ct. 2382 (citations omitted).  As
the Court of Appeals did not hold that the detention was prolonged by the
questioning, there was no additional seizure within the meaning of the Fourth
Amendment.  Hence, the officers did not need reasonable suspicion to ask Mena
for her name, date and place of birth, or immigration status.

Our recent opinion in  Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U.S. 405, 160 L. Ed. 2d 842,
125 S. Ct. 834 (2005), is instructive.   [***309]  There, we held that a dog
sniff performed during a traffic stop does not violate the Fourth Amendment.  We
noted that  [HN8] a lawful seizure ""can become unlawful if it is prolonged
beyond the time reasonably required to complete that mission,"" but accepted the
state court's determination that the duration of the stop was not extended by
the dog sniff.   Id., at 407, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 846, 125 S. Ct., at 837.
Because we held that a dog sniff was not a search subject to the Fourth
Amendment, we rejected the notion that ""the shift in purpose"" ""from a lawful
traffic stop into a drug investigation"" was unlawful because it ""was not
supported by any reasonable suspicion.""  Id., at 408, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 847, 125
S. Ct., at 837.  Likewise here, the initial Summers detention was lawful; the
Court of Appeals did not find that the questioning extended the [**1472]  time
Mena was detained. Thus no additional Fourth Amendment justification for
inquiring about Mena's immigration status was required. 3

+873, 45 L. Ed. 2d 607, 95 S. Ct. 2574 (1975), is misplaced.  Brignoni-Ponce
held that stops by roving patrols near the border ""may be justified on facts
that do not amount to the probable cause require[ment] for an arrest.""  Id., at
880, 45 L. Ed. 2d 607, 95 S. Ct. 2574.  We considered only whether the patrols
had the ""authority to stop automobiles in areas near the Mexican border,""  id.,
at 874, 45 L. Ed. 2d 607, 95 S. Ct. 2574 (emphasis added), and expressed no
opinion as to the appropriateness of questioning when an individual was already
seized.  See  United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 556-562, 49 L. Ed.
2d 1116, 96 S. Ct. 3074 (1976).  We certainly did not, as the Court of Appeals
suggested, create a ""requirement of particularized reasonable suspicion for
purposes of inquiry into citizenship status.""  332 F.3d, at 1267.

 [*102]    [***LEdHR1A] [1G]  [***LEdHR2A] [2C]  [***LEdHR7] [7] In summary, the
officers' detention of Mena in handcuffs during the execution of the search
warrant was reasonable and did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  Additionally,
the officers' questioning of Mena did not constitute an independent Fourth
Amendment violation.  Mena has advanced in this Court, as she did before the
Court of Appeals, an alternative argument for affirming the judgment below.  She
asserts that her detention extended beyond the time the police completed the
tasks incident to the search.  Because the Court of Appeals did not address this
contention, we too decline to address it.  See  Pierce County v. Guillen, 537
U.S. 129, 148, n. 10, 154 L. Ed. 2d 610, 123 S. Ct. 720 (2003);  NCAA v. Smith,
525 U.S. 459, 469-470, 142 L. Ed. 2d 929, 119 S. Ct. 924 (1999).

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore vacated, and the case is
remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

CONCUR BY: KENNEDY; STEVENS

CONCUR

Justice Kennedy, concurring.

I concur in the judgment and in the opinion of the Court.  It does seem
important to add this brief statement to help ensure that police handcuffing
during searches becomes neither routine nor unduly prolonged.

The safety of the officers and the efficacy of the search are matters of first
concern, but so too is it a matter of first concern that excessive force is not
used on the persons detained, especially when these persons, though lawfully
detained under  Michigan v. Summers, 452 U.S. 692, 69 L. Ed. 2d 340, 101 S. Ct.
2587  [***310]  (1981), are not themselves suspected of any involvement in
criminal  [*103]  activity.  The use of handcuffs is the use of force, and such
force must be objectively reasonable under the circumstances,  Graham v. Connor,
490 U.S. 386, 104 L. Ed. 2d 443, 109 S. Ct. 1865 (1989).

The reasonableness calculation under Graham is in part a function of the
expected and actual duration of the search.  If the search extends to the point
when the handcuffs can cause real pain or serious discomfort, provision must be
made to alter the conditions of detention at least long enough to attend to the
needs of the detainee. This is so even if there is no question that the initial
handcuffing was objectively reasonable.  The restraint should also be removed
if, at any point during the search, it would be readily apparent to any
objectively reasonable officer that removing the handcuffs would not compromise
the officers' safety or risk interference or substantial delay in the execution
of the search.  The time spent in the search here, some two to three hours,
certainly approaches, and may well exceed,  [**1473]  the time beyond which a
detainee's Fourth Amendment interests require revisiting the necessity of
handcuffing in order to ensure the restraint, even if permissible as an initial
matter, has not become excessive.

That said, under these circumstances I do not think handcuffing the detainees
for the duration of the search was objectively unreasonable.  As I understand
the record, during much of this search 2 armed officers were available to watch
over the 4 unarmed detainees, while the other 16 officers on the scene conducted
an extensive search of a suspected gang safe house.  Even if we accept as
true--as we must--the factual assertions that these detainees posed no readily
apparent danger and that keeping them handcuffed deviated from standard police
procedure, it does not follow that the handcuffs were unreasonable.  Where the
detainees outnumber those supervising them, and this situation could not be
remedied without diverting officers from an extensive, complex, and
time-consuming search,  the continued use of handcuffs after the initial sweep
may be justified, subject to  [*104]  adjustments or temporary release under
supervision to avoid pain or excessive physical discomfort.  Because on this
record it does not appear the restraints were excessive, I join the opinion of
the Court.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer
join, concurring in the judgment.

The jury in this case found that the two petitioners violated Iris Mena's Fourth
Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure by detaining her with
greater force and for a longer period of time than was reasonable under the
circumstances.  In their post-trial motion in the District Court, petitioners
advanced three legal arguments: (1) They were entitled to qualified immunity
because the unconstitutionality of their conduct was not clearly established; 1
(2) the judge's instruction to the jury  [***311]  was erroneous; 2 and (3) the
evidence was not sufficient to support the jury's award of [*105]  punitive
damages.  The trial judge's thoughtful explanation of his reasons for denying
the motion does not address either of the issues the Court discusses today.

1 The Court of Appeals' conclusion that the officers were not entitled to
qualified immunity was not challenged in the petition for certiorari and is
therefore waived.  See  Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U.S. 638, 645-646, 118
L. Ed. 2d 280, 112 S. Ct. 1644 (1992).

2 The trial judge instructed the jury as follows:

""'Generally, a police officer carrying out a search authorized by a warrant may
detain occupants of the residence during the search, so long as the detention is
reasonable.

""'In determining the reasonableness of a detention conducted in connection with
a search, you may look to all the circumstances, including the severity of the
suspected crime, whether the person being detained is the subject of the
investigation, whether such person poses an immediate threat to the security of
the police or others or to the ability of the police to conduct the search, and
whether such person is actively resisting arrest or attempting to flee.  A
detention may be unreasonable if it is unnecessarily painful, degrading,
prolonged or if it involves an undue invasion of privacy.  A police officer is
required to release an individual detained in connection with a lawful search as
soon as the officers' right to conduct the search ends or the search itself is
concluded, whichever is sooner.'""  Mena v. Simi Valley, 332 F.3d 1255, 1267-1268
(CA9 2003) (alterations omitted; one paragraph break added).

 In its opinion affirming the judgment, the Court of Appeals made two mistakes.
First, as the Court explains,  ante, at 100-101, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 308, it
erroneously held that the immigration officers' questioning of Mena about her
[**1474]  immigration status was an independent violation of the Fourth
Amendment. 3 Second, instead of merely deciding whether there was sufficient
evidence in the record to support the jury's verdict, the Court of Appeals
appears to have ruled as a matter of law that the officers should have released
her from the handcuffs sooner than they did.  I agree that it is appropriate to
remand the case to enable the Court of Appeals to consider whether the evidence
supports Mena's contention that she was held longer than the search actually
lasted.  In doing so, the Court of Appeals must of course accord appropriate
deference to the jury's reasonable factual findings, while applying the correct
legal standard.  See  Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 699, 134 L. Ed. 2d
911, 116 S. Ct. 1657 (1996).

3 While I agree with the Court's discussion of this issue, I note that the issue
was not properly presented to the Ninth Circuit because it was not raised by
either petitioners or respondent.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 In my judgment, however, the Court's discussion of the amount of force used to
detain Mena pursuant to  Michigan v. Summers, 452 U.S. 692, 69 L. Ed. 2d 340,
101 S. Ct. 2587 (1981), is analytically unsound.  Although the Court correctly
purports to apply the ""objective reasonableness"" test announced in  Graham v.
Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 104 L. Ed. 2d 443, 109 S. Ct. 1865 (1989), it misapplies
that test.  Given the facts of this case--and the presumption that a reviewing
court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of supporting the verdict--I
think it clear that the jury could properly have found that this 5-foot-2-inch
young lady posed no threat to the officers at the scene, and that they used
excessive force in keeping her in handcuffs for up to three hours.  Although
Summers authorizes the detention of any individual  [*106]  who is present when
a valid search warrant is being executed, that case does not give officers carte
blanche to keep individuals who pose no threat in handcuffs throughout a search,
no matter how long it may last.  On remand, I would therefore instruct the Court
of Appeals to consider  [***312]  whether the evidence supports Mena's
contention that the petitioners used excessive force in detaining her when it
considers the length of the Summers detention.

I

As the Court notes, the warrant in this case authorized the police to enter the
Mena home to search for a gun belonging to Raymond Romero that may have been
used in a gang-related driveby shooting.  Romero, a known member of the West
Side Locos gang, rented a room from the Mena family.  The house, described as a
""'poor house,'"" was home to several unrelated individuals who rented from the
Menas.  Brief for Petitioners 4.  Each resident had his or her own bedroom,
which could be locked with a padlock on the outside, and each had access to the
living room and kitchen.  In addition, several individuals lived in trailers in
the back yard and also had access to the common spaces in the Mena home.  Id.,
at 5.

In addition to Romero, police had reason to believe that at least one other West
Side Locos gang member had lived at the residence, although Romero's brother
told police that the individual had returned to Mexico.  The officers in charge
of the search, petitioners Muehler and Brill, had been at the same residence a
few months earlier on an unrelated domestic violence call, but did not see any
other individuals they believed to be gang members inside the home on that
occasion.

[**1475]  In light of the fact that the police believed that Romero possessed a
gun and that there might be other gang members at the residence, petitioner
Muehler decided to use a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team to execute the
[*107]  warrant.  As described in the majority opinion, eight members of the
SWAT team forcefully entered the home at 7 a.m. In fact, Mena was the only
occupant of the house, and she was asleep in her bedroom. The police woke her up
at gunpoint, and immediately handcuffed her.  At the same time, officers served
another search warrant at the home of Romero's mother, where Romero was known to
stay several nights each week.  In part because Romero's mother had previously
cooperated with police officers, they did not use a SWAT team to serve that
warrant.  Romero was found at his mother's house; after being cited for
possession of a small amount of marijuana, he was released.

Meanwhile, after the SWAT team secured the Mena residence and gave the ""all
clear,"" police officers transferred Mena and three other individuals (who had
been in trailers in the back yard) to a converted garage. 4 To get to the
garage, Mena, who was still in her bedclothes, was forced to walk barefoot
through the pouring rain.  The officers kept her and the other three individuals
in the garage for up to three hours while they searched the home.  Although she
requested them to remove the handcuffs, they refused to do so.  For the duration
of the search, two officers guarded Mena and the other three detainees. A .22
caliber handgun, ammunition, and gang-related paraphernalia  [***313]  were
found in Romero's bedroom, and other gang-related paraphernalia was found in the
living room.  Officers found nothing of significance in Mena's bedroom. 5 Id.,
at 6-9.

male who was removed from the scene by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS), and a white male who appears to be in his early 30's and who was
cited for possession of a small amount of marijuana.

5 One of the justifications for our decision in  Michigan v. Summers, 452 U.S.
692, 69 L. Ed. 2d 340, 101 S. Ct. 2587 (1981), was the fact that the occupants
may be willing to ""open locked doors or locked containers to avoid the use of
force that is not only damaging to property but may also delay the completion of
the task at hand.""  Id., at 703, 69 L. Ed. 2d 340, 101 S. Ct. 2587.  Mean,

"            DENNIS BATES, et al., Petitioners v. DOW AGROSCIENCES LLC",544 U.S. 431,"

 [*434]  [**1792]   Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR3A]  Petitioners are 29 Texas peanut
farmers who allege that in the 2000 growing [**1793]  season their crops were
severely damaged by the application of respondent's newly marketed pesticide
named ""Strongarm."" The question presented is whether the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), 7 U.S.C. § 136 et seq. (2000 ed. and
Supp. II), pre-empts their state-law claims for damages.

I

[***LEdHR4A]  Pursuant to its authority under FIFRA, the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) conditionally registered Strongarm on March 8, 2000,
thereby granting respondent (Dow) permission to sell this pesticide--a weed
killer 1--in  [*435]  the United States.  Dow obtained this registration in time
to market Strongarm to Texas farmers, who normally plant their peanut crops
around May 1.  According to petitioners--whose version of the facts we assume to
be true at this stage--Dow knew, or should have known, that Strongarm would
stunt the growth of peanuts in soils with pH levels of 7.0 or greater. 2
Nevertheless, Strongarm's label stated, ""Use of Strongarm is recommended in all
areas where peanuts are grown,"" App. 108, and Dow's agents made equivalent
representations in their sales pitches to petitioners.  When petitioners applied
Strongarm on their farms--whose  [***698]  soils have pH levels of 7.2 or
higher, as is typical in western Texas--the pesticide severely damaged their
peanut crops while failing to control the growth of weeds.  The farmers reported
these problems to Dow, which sent its experts to inspect the crops.

pesticide for purposes of FIFRA.  See 7 U.S.C. §§ 136(t), (u).

2 The term ""pH,"" which stands for pondus hydrogenii, or ""potential hydrogen,""
refers to the acidity of the soil.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Meanwhile, Dow reregistered its Strongarm label with EPA prior to the 2001
growing season.  EPA approved a ""supplemental"" label that was for
""[d]istribution and [u]se [o]nly in the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and
Texas,"" id., at 179, the three States in which peanut farmers experienced crop
damage.  This new label contained the following warning: ""Do not apply Strongarm
to soils with a pH of 7.2 or greater."" Id., at 181.

[***LEdHR4A]   [***LEdHR5A]  After unsuccessful negotiations with Dow,
petitioners gave Dow notice of their intent to bring suit as required by the
Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act 3 (hereinafter Texas
DTPA).  In response, Dow filed a declaratory judgment action in Federal District
Court, asserting that petitioners' claims were expressly or impliedly pre-empted
by FIFRA.  Petitioners, in turn, brought counterclaims, including tort claims
sounding in strict liability and negligence.  They also alleged fraud, breach of
warranty,  [*436]  and violation of the Texas DTPA.  The District Court granted
Dow's motion for summary judgment, rejecting one claim on state-law grounds and
dismissing the remainder as expressly pre-empted by  [HN1] 7 U.S.C. § 136v(b),
which provides that States ""shall not impose or continue in effect any
requirements for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those
required under this subchapter.""

 The Court of Appeals affirmed.  It read § 136v(b) to pre-empt any state-law
claim in which ""a judgment against Dow would induce it to alter its product
label.""  332 F.3d 323, 331 (CA5 2003).  The court held that because petitioners'
fraud, warranty, and deceptive trade practices claims focused on oral statements
by Dow's agents that did not differ from statements made [**1794]  on the
product's label, success on those claims would give Dow a ""strong incentive"" to
change its label. Those claims were thus pre-empted.  Id., at 331-332.  The
court also found that petitioners' strict liability claim alleging defective
design was essentially a ""disguised"" failure-to-warn claim and therefore
pre-empted.  Id., at 332.  It reasoned: ""One cannot escape the heart of the
farmers' grievance: Strongarm is dangerous to peanut crops in soil with a pH
level over 7.0, and that was not disclosed to them.  . . .  It is inescapable
that success on this claim would again necessarily induce Dow to alter the
Strongarm label.""  Id., at 332-333.  The court employed similar reasoning to
find the negligent testing and negligent manufacture claims pre-empted as well.
Id., at 333.

This decision was consistent with those of a majority of the Courts of Appeals,
4 as well of several state high courts, 5 but conflicted with the  [***699]
decisions of other courts 6 and with  [*437]  the views of EPA set forth in an
amicus curiae brief filed with the California Supreme Court in 2000. 7 We
granted certiorari to resolve this conflict.   542 U.S. 936, 159 L. Ed. 2d 810,

Prior to 1910 the States provided the primary and possibly the exclusive source
of regulatory control over the distribution of poisonous substances.  Both the
Federal Government's first effort at regulation in this area, the Insecticide
Act of 1910, 36 Stat. 331, and FIFRA as originally enacted in 1947, ch 125, 61
Stat. 163, primarily dealt with licensing and labeling. Under the original
version of FIFRA, all pesticides sold in interstate commerce had to be
registered with the Secretary of Agriculture.  The Secretary would register a
pesticide if it complied with the statute's labeling standards and was
determined to be efficacious and safe. 8 In 1970, EPA assumed responsibility for
this registration process.

8 If the Secretary declined registration, and the manufacturer refused to make
changes, the Secretary was required to register the pesticide ""under protest.""
In 1964, however, Congress eliminated this procedure, and required disappointed
manufacturers to challenge a denial of registration through administrative
review.  78 Stat. 190.

 In 1972, spurred by growing environmental and safety concerns, Congress adopted
the extensive amendments 9 that ""transformed FIFRA from a labeling law into a
comprehensive regulatory statute.""  Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986,
991, 81 L. Ed. 2d 815, 104 S. Ct. 2862 (1984).  ""As amended, FIFRA regulated the
use, as well as the sale and labeling, of pesticides; regulated pesticides
produced and sold in both intrastate and interstate commerce; provided for
review, cancellation, and suspension of registration; and [**1795]  gave EPA
greater enforcement authority.""  Id., at 991-992, 81 L. Ed. 2d 815, 104 S. Ct.
2862.  The 1972 amendments also imposed  [*438]  a new criterion for
registration--environmental safety.   Id., at 992, 81 L. Ed. 2d 815, 104 S. Ct.

 [HN2] Under FIFRA as it currently stands, a manufacturer seeking to register a
pesticide must submit a proposed label to EPA as well as certain supporting
data.  7 U.S.C. §§ 136a(c)(1)(C), (F).  The agency will register the pesticide
if it determines that the pesticide is efficacious (with the caveat discussed
below), § 136a(c)(5)(A); that it will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on
humans and the environment, §§ 136a(c)(5)(C), (D); § 136(bb); and that its label
complies with the statute's prohibition on misbranding, § 136a(c)(5)(B); 40
C.F.R. § 152.112(f) (2004).  A pesticide is ""misbranded"" if its label contains a
statement that is ""false or misleading in any particular,"" including a false or
misleading statement concerning the efficacy of  [***700]  the pesticide. 7
U.S.C. § 136(q)(1)(A); 40 C.F.R. § 156.10(a)(5)(ii).  A pesticide is also
misbranded if its label does not contain adequate instructions for use, or if
its label omits necessary warnings or cautionary statements.  7 U.S.C. §§

10 A pesticide label must also conspicuously display any statement or
information specifically required by the statute or its implementing
regulations. 7 U.S.C. § 136(q)(1)(E).  To mention only a few examples, the label
must contain the name and address of the producer, the product registration
number, and an ingredient statement.  40 C.F.R. §§ 156.10(a)(1)(ii), (iv), (vi)

  [HN3] Because it is unlawful under the statute to sell a pesticide that is
registered but nevertheless misbranded, manufacturers have a continuing
obligation to adhere to FIFRA's labeling requirements.  § 136j(a)(1)(E); see
also § 136a(f)(2) (registration is prima facie evidence that the pesticide and

provide a defense to the violation of the statute); § 136a(f)(1) (a manufacturer

  [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR3A]  Section 136v, which was added in
the 1972 amendments, addresses the States' continuing role in pesticide
regulation. As currently codified, § 136v provides:


      [HN4] ""(a) In general

     ""A State may regulate the sale or use of any federally registered
     pesticide or device in the State, but only if and to the extent the
     regulation does not permit any sale or use prohibited by this
     subchapter.

     ""(b) Uniformity

     ""Such State shall not impose or continue in effect any requirements
     for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those
     required under this subchapter.

     ""(c) Additional uses

     ""(1) A State may provide registration for additional uses of federally
     registered pesticides formulated for distribution and use within that
     State to meet [**1796]  special local needs in accord with the
     purposes of this subchapter and if registration for such use has not
     previously been denied, disapproved, or canceled by the Administrator.
     Such registration shall be deemed registration under section 136a of
     this title for all purposes of this subchapter, but shall authorize
     distribution and use only within such State.  . . .""



 [*440]  In 1978, Congress once again amended FIFRA, 92 Stat 819, this time in
response to EPA's concern that its evaluation of pesticide efficacy during the
registration process diverted too many resources from its task of assessing the
environmental and health dangers posed by pesticides. Congress addressed this
problem by  [HN5] authorizing EPA to waive data requirements pertaining to
efficacy,  [***701]  thus permitting the agency to register a pesticide without
confirming the efficacy claims made on its label. § 136a(c)(5).  In 1979, EPA
invoked this grant of permission and issued a general waiver of efficacy review,
with only limited qualifications not applicable here.  See  44 Fed. Reg. 27932
(1979); 40 C.F.R. § 158.640(b) (2004).  In a notice published years later in
1996, EPA confirmed that it had ""stopped evaluating pesticide efficacy for
routine label approvals almost two decades ago,""  Pesticide Registration Notice
96-4, p 3 (June 3, 1996), available at
http://www.epa.gov/opppmsd1/PR_Notices/pr96-4.html, App. 232, and clarified that
""EPA's approval of a pesticide label does not reflect any determination on the
part of EPA that the pesticide will be efficacious or will not damage crops or
cause other property damage,"" id., at 5, App. 235.  The notice also referred to
an earlier statement in which EPA observed that ""'pesticide producers are aware
that they are potentially subject to damage suits by the user community if their
products prove ineffective in actual use.'"" Id., at 2, App. 230 (quoting  47
Fed. Reg. 40661 (col. 2) (1982)).  This general waiver was in place at the time
of Strongarm's registration; thus, EPA never passed on the accuracy of the
statement in Strongarm's original label recommending the product's use ""in all
areas where peanuts are grown.""

Although the modern version of FIFRA was enacted over three decades ago, this
Court has never addressed whether that statute pre-empts tort and other
common-law claims arising under state law.  Courts entertained tort litigation
against pesticide manufacturers since well before the passage  [*441]  of FIFRA
in 1947, 12 and such litigation was a common feature of the legal landscape at
the time of the 1972 amendments. 13 Indeed, for at least a decade after those
amendments, arguments that such tort suits were pre-empted by § 136v(b) either
were not advanced or were unsuccessful.  See, e.g.,  Ferebee v. Chevron Chemical
Co., 237 U.S. App. D.C. 164, 736 F.2d 1529 (CADC 1984).  It was only after 1992
when we held in  Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 120 L. Ed. 2d
407, 112 S. Ct. 2608, that the term ""requirement [**1797]  or prohibition"" in
the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 included common-law duties, and
therefore pre-empted certain tort claims against cigarette companies, that a
groundswell of federal and state decisions emerged holding that § 136v(b)
pre-empted claims like those advanced in this litigation.

 This Court has addressed FIFRA pre-emption in a different context.  In
Wisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier, 501 U.S. 597, 115 L. Ed. 2d 532, 111 S.
Ct. 2476 (1991), we considered a claim that § 136v(b) pre-empted a small town's
ordinance  [***702]  requiring a special permit for the aerial application of
pesticides. Although the ordinance imposed restrictions not required by FIFRA or
any EPA regulation, we unanimously rejected the pre-emption claim.  In our
opinion we noted that FIFRA was not ""a sufficiently comprehensive statute to
justify an inference that Congress had occupied the field to the exclusion of
the [*442]  States.""  Id., at 607, 115 L. Ed. 2d 532, 111 S. Ct. 2476.  ""To the
contrary, the statute leaves ample room for States and localities to supplement
federal efforts even absent the express regulatory authorization of § 136v(a).""
Id., at 613, 115 L. Ed. 2d 532, 111 S. Ct. 2476.

[HN6]  [***LEdHR6A]   [***LEdHR7] [7] As a part of their supplementary role,
States have ample authority to review pesticide labels to ensure that they
comply with both federal and state labeling requirements. 14 Nothing in the text
of FIFRA would prevent a State from making the violation of a federal labeling
or packaging requirement a state offense, thereby imposing its own sanctions on
pesticide manufacturers who violate federal law.  The imposition of state
sanctions for violating state rules that merely duplicate federal requirements
is equally consistent with the text of § 136v.

[***LEdHR9A]   [***LEdHR10A]  Against this background, we consider whether
petitioners' claims 15 are pre-empted by § 136v(b), which, again, reads as
[*443]  follows: ""Such State shall not impose or continue in effect any
requirements for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those
required under this subchapter.""

15  [***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR3A]   [***LEdHR5A]  The briefing and the record
leave some confusion as to what precise claims are at issue.  In light of the
posture of this case, we find it appropriate to address the following claims:
breach of express warranty, fraud, violation of the Texas DTPA, strict liability
(including defective design and defective manufacture), and negligent testing.
We will also address negligent failure to warn, since the Court of Appeals read
petitioners' allegations to support such a claim.  But because petitioners do
not press such a claim here, we leave it to the court below to determine whether
they may proceed on such a claim on remand.  Of course, we express no view as to
whether any of these claims are viable as a matter of Texas law.  Nor do we,
given the early stage of this litigation, opine on whether petitioners can
adduce sufficient evidence in support of their claims to survive summary
judgment.

  [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR3A]   [***LEdHR8A]  The introductory
words of § 136v(b) --""Such State""--appear to limit the coverage of that
subsection to the States that are [**1798]  described in the preceding
subsection (a).  Texas is such a State because it regulates the sale and use of
federally registered pesticides and does not permit any sales or uses prohibited
by FIFRA.  It is therefore beyond dispute that subsection (b) is applicable to
this case.

[HN7]  [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR9A]   [***LEdHR10A]  The prohibitions in §
136v(b) apply only to ""requirements."" An occurrence that merely  [***703]
motivates an optional decision does not qualify as a requirement.  The Court of
Appeals was therefore quite wrong when it assumed that any event, such as a jury
verdict, that might ""induce"" a pesticide manufacturer to change its label should
be viewed as a requirement.  The Court of Appeals did, however, correctly hold
that the term ""requirements"" in § 136v(b) reaches beyond positive enactments,
such as statutes and regulations, to embrace common-law duties. Our decision in
Cipollone supports this conclusion.  See  505 U.S., at 521, 120 L. Ed. 2d 407,
112 S. Ct. 2608 (plurality opinion) (""The phrase '[n]o requirement or
prohibition' sweeps broadly and suggests no distinction between positive
enactments and common law; to the contrary, those words easily encompass
obligations that take the form of common-law rules""); see also  id., at 548-549,
120 L. Ed. 2d 407, 112 S. Ct. 2608 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part
and dissenting in part).  While the use of ""requirements"" in a pre-emption
clause may not invariably carry this meaning, we think this is the best reading
of § 136v(b).

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR10A]   [***LEdHR11A]  That § 136v(b) may pre-empt
judge-made rules, as well as statutes and regulations, says nothing about the
scope of that  [*444]  pre-emption.  [HN8] For a particular state rule to be
pre-empted, it must satisfy two conditions.  First, it must be a requirement ""
for labeling or packaging""; rules governing the design of a product, for
example, are not pre-empted. Second, it must impose a labeling or packaging
requirement that is ""in addition to or different from those required under this
subchapter."" A state regulation requiring the word ""poison"" to appear in red
letters, for instance, would not be pre-empted if an EPA regulation imposed the
same requirement.

[***LEdHR2A]  It is perfectly clear that many of the common-law rules upon which
petitioners rely do not satisfy the first condition.  Rules that require
manufacturers to design reasonably safe products,  to use due care in conducting
appropriate testing of their products, to market products free of manufacturing
defects, and to honor their express warranties or other contractual commitments
plainly do not qualify as requirements for ""labeling or packaging."" None of
these common-law rules requires that manufacturers label or package their
products in any particular way.  Thus, petitioners' claims for defective design,
defective manufacture, negligent testing, and breach of express warranty are not
pre-empted.

[***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR3A]   [***LEdHR12] [12]  [***LEdHR13A]  To be sure,
Dow's express warranty was located on Strongarm's label. 16 But  [HN9] a cause
of action on an express warranty asks only that a manufacturer make good on the
contractual commitment that it voluntarily undertook by placing that warranty on
its product. 17 Because this [**1799]   [*445]  common-law rule does not require
the manufacturer to make an express warranty, or in the event  [***704]  that
the manufacturer elects to do so, to say anything in particular in that
warranty, the rule does not impose a requirement ""for labeling or packaging.""
See  id., at 525-526, 120 L. Ed. 2d 407, 112 S. Ct. 2608 (plurality opinion). 18

16 The label stated: ""Dow AgroSciences warrants that this product conforms to
the chemical description on the label and is reasonably fit for the purposes
stated on the label when used in strict accordance with the directions, subject
to the inherent risks set forth below."" App. 111.

17  [***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR3A]   [***LEdHR13A]  To the extent that petitioners'
warranty and fraud claims are based on oral representations made by Dow's
agents, they fall outside the text of § 136v(b) for an independent reason.
[HN10] Because FIFRA defines labeling as ""all labels and all other written,
printed, or graphic matter"" that accompany a pesticide, § 136(p)(2), any
requirement that applied to a sales agent's oral representations would not be a
requirement for ""labeling or packaging.""

18  [***LEdHR2A]  The Court of Appeals held that petitioners' claim under the
Texas DTPA was pre-empted insofar as the Act provides a remedy for the breach of
an express warranty.   332 F.3d 323, 332 (CA5 2003) (citing Texas law).  Because
petitioners' warranty claim is not pre-empted, their claim under the Act is not
pre-empted to that extent.

 [***LEdHR1A]  In arriving at a different conclusion, the court below reasoned
that a finding of liability on these claims would ""induce Dow to alter [its]
label.""  332 F.3d at 332. 19 This effects-based test finds no support in the
text of § 136v(b), which speaks only of ""requirements."" A requirement is a rule
of law that must be obeyed; an event, such as a jury verdict, that merely
motivates an optional decision is not a requirement.  The proper inquiry calls
for an examination of the elements of the common-law duty at issue, see
Cipollone, 505 U.S., at 524, 120 L. Ed. 2d 407, 112 S. Ct. 2608(plurality
opinion); it does not call for speculation as to whether a jury verdict will
prompt the manufacturer to take any particular action (a question, in any event,
that will depend on a variety of cost/benefit calculations best left to the
manufacturer's accountants).

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - Footnotes - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

19 Other Courts of Appeals have taken a similar approach.  See, e.g.,  Netland,
284 F.3d at 900 (""Thus, our task is to determine whether Netland's claims are
essentially a challenge to Bovinol's label or the overall design of the
pesticide. To guide our analysis, we must ask whether in seeking to avoid
liability for any error, would the manufacturer choose to alter the label or the
product"").
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR6A]  The inducement test is unquestionably overbroad
because it would impeach many ""genuine""  design defect claims that Dow concedes
are not pre-empted. A design defect claim, if successful, would surely induce a
manufacturer to alter its label to reflect a change in the list of ingredients
or a change in the instructions for use necessitated by the improvement  [*446]
in the product's design.  Moreover, the inducement test is not entirely
consistent with § 136v(a), which confirms the State's broad authority to
regulate the sale and use of pesticides. 20 Under § 136v(a), a state agency may
ban the sale of a pesticide if it finds, for instance, that one of the
pesticide's label-approved uses is unsafe.  This ban might well induce the
manufacturer to change its label to warn against this questioned use.  Under the
inducement test, however, such a restriction would anomalously qualify as a
""labeling"" requirement.  It is highly unlikely that Congress endeavored to draw
a line between the type of indirect pressure caused by a State's power to impose
sales and use restrictions and the even more attenuated pressure exerted by
common-law suits.  The inducement test is not supported by either the text or
the structure of the statute.

 [*584]  [***929]  [**2034]    JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the
Court, except as to Part II-A.

Oklahoma has a semiclosed primary system, in which a political party may invite
only its own party members and voters registered as Independents to vote in the
party's primary. The Court of Appeals held that this system violates the right
to freedom of association of the Libertarian Party of Oklahoma (LPO) and several
Oklahomans who are registered members of the Republican and Democratic Parties.
We hold that it does not.

I

[HN1] Oklahoma's election laws provide that only registered members of a
political party may vote in the party's primary,  [*585]  see Okla. Stat. Ann.,
Tit. 26, § 1-104(A) (West 1997), unless the party opens its primary to
registered Independents as well, see § 1-104(B)(1). In May 2000, the LPO
notified the secretary of the Oklahoma State Election Board that it wanted to
open its upcoming primary to all registered Oklahoma voters, without regard to
their party affiliation. See § 1-104(B)(4) (requiring notice when a party opens
its primary to Independents). Pursuant to § 1-104, the secretary agreed as to
Independent voters, but not as to voters registered with other political
parties. The LPO and several Republican and Democratic voters then sued for
declaratory and injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Oklahoma, alleging that Oklahoma's semiclosed primary law
unconstitutionally burdens their First Amendment right to freedom of political
association. App. 20.

After a hearing, the District Court declined to enjoin Oklahoma's semiclosed
primary law for the 2000 primaries. After a 2-day bench trial following the
primary election, the District Court found that Oklahoma's semiclosed primary
system did not severely burden respondents' associational rights. Further, it
found that any burden imposed by the system was justified by Oklahoma's asserted
interest in ""preserving the political parties as viable and identifiable
interest groups, [and] insuring that the results of a primary election . . .
accurately reflect the voting of the party members."" Memorandum Opinion, Case
No. CIV-00-1071-F (WD Okla., Jan. 24, 2003), App. to Pet. for Cert. 55-56
(hereinafter Memorandum Opinion)(internal quotation marks omitted). The District
Court therefore upheld the semiclosed primary statute as constitutional. Id., at
72-73.

On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed the judgment of
the District Court. The Court of Appeals concluded that the State's semiclosed
primary statute imposed a severe burden on respondents' associational rights,
and thus was constitutional only if the statute was  [*586]  narrowly tailored
to serve a compelling state interest.  363 F.3d 1048, 1057-1058 (2004). Finding
[***930]  none of Oklahoma's interests compelling, the Court of Appeals enjoined
Oklahoma from using its semiclosed primary law.  Id., at 1060-1061. Because the
Court of Appeals' decision not only prohibits Oklahoma from using its primary
system but also casts doubt on the semiclosed primary laws of 23 other States, 1
we [**2035]  granted certiorari.  542 U.S. 965, 542 U.S. 965, 125 S. Ct. 27, 159

who espouse their political views.""  California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530
U.S. 567, 574, 147 L. Ed. 2d 502, 120 S. Ct. 2402 (2000). Regulations that
impose severe burdens on associational rights must be narrowly tailored to serve
a compelling state interest.  Timmons, 520 U.S., at 358, 137 L. Ed. 2d 589, 117
S. Ct. 1364. However,  [*587]  when regulations impose lesser burdens, ""a
State's important regulatory interests will usually be enough to justify
reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions."" Ibid. (internal quotation marks
omitted).

In Tashjian, this Court struck down, as inconsistent with the First Amendment, a
closed primary system that prevented a political party from inviting Independent
voters to vote in the party's primary.  479 U.S., at 225, 93 L. Ed. 2d 514, 107
S. Ct. 544. This case presents a question that Tashjian left open: whether a
State may prevent a political party from inviting registered voters of other
parties to vote in its primary.  Id., at 224, n. 13, 93 L. Ed. 514, 107 S. Ct.
544. As Tashjian acknowledged, opening a party's primary ""to all voters,
including members of other parties, . . . raises a different combination of
considerations."" Ibid. We are persuaded that any burden Oklahoma's semiclosed
primary imposes is minor and justified by legitimate state interests.

A

At the outset, we note that Oklahoma's semiclosed primary system is unlike other
laws this Court has held to infringe associational rights. Oklahoma has not
sought through its electoral system to discover the names of the LPO's members,
see  [***931]   NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 451, 2 L. Ed.
2d 1488, 78 S. Ct. 1163 (1958); to interfere with the LPO by restricting
activities central to its purpose, see  NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458
U.S. 886, 895, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1215, 102 S. Ct. 3409 (1982);  NAACP v. Button, 371
U.S. 415, 423-426, 9 L. Ed. 2d 405, 83 S. Ct. 328 (1963); to disqualify the LPO
from public benefits or privileges, see  Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ.
of State of N. Y., 385 U.S. 589, 595-596, 17 L. Ed. 2d 629, 87 S. Ct. 675 (1967)
; or to compel the LPO's association with unwanted members or voters, see  ,
Jones, supra, at 577. The LPO is free to canvass the electorate, enroll or
exclude potential members, nominate the candidate of its choice, and engage in
the same electoral activities as every other political party in Oklahoma.
Oklahoma merely prohibits the LPO from leaving the selection of its candidates
to people who are members of  [*588]  another political party. Nothing in §
1-104 prevents members of other parties [**2036]  from switching their
registration to the LPO or to Independent status. 2 The question is whether the
Constitution requires that voters who are registered in other parties be allowed
to vote in the LPO's primary.

2 Respondents argue, for the first time before this Court, that Oklahoma
election statutes other than § 1-104 make it difficult for voters to
disaffiliate from their parties of first choice and register as Libertarians or
Independents (either of which would allow them to vote in the LPO primary).
Brief for Respondents 13-19. For reasons we explain fully in Part III, we
decline to consider this aspect of respondents' challenge. See infra, at
597-598.

  In other words, the Republican and Democratic voters who have brought this
action do not want to associate with the LPO, at least not in any formal sense.
They wish to remain registered with the Republican, Democratic, or Reform
parties, and yet to assist in selecting the Libertarian Party's candidates for
the general election. Their interest is in casting a vote for a Libertarian
candidate in a particular primary election, 3 rather than in banding together
with fellow citizens committed to the LPO's political goals and ideas. See
Jones, supra, at 573-574, n. 5, 147 L. Ed. 2d 502, 120 S. Ct. 2402 (""As for the
associational 'interest' in selecting the candidate of a group to which one does
not belong, that falls far short of a constitutional right, if indeed it  [*589]
can even fairly be characterized as an interest""). And the LPO is happy to have
their votes, if not their membership on the party rolls.

3 Respondents who are members of the Republican and Democratic Parties alleged
before the District Court that they wished to have the right to participate in
the 2000 LPO primary. See Amended Complaint 4, Record Doc. 23; Complaint 3, id.,
Doc. 1. The only evidence respondents submitted on this point was a pair of
affidavits from respondents Mary Burnett (a registered Republican) and Floyd
Turner (a registered Democrat), asserting that each might have wished to vote in
the 2000 LPO primary. See Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction, id.,
Doc. 9 (attached affidavits). Based on Turner's affidavit, the parties
stipulated that there were ""a number of voters"" ""registered in political parties
other than the [LPO] who wish[ed] to vote"" in the 2000 LPO primary. See
Supplemental Joint Stipulations of Fact P32, id., Doc. 17. Respondents have
never claimed that they are prevented from associating with the LPO in any way,
except that they are unable to vote in the LPO's primary and run-off elections.

 However, a voter who is unwilling to disaffiliate from another party to vote in
the LPO's primary forms little ""association"" with the LPO -- nor the LPO with
him. See  Tashjian, supra, at 235, 93 L. Ed. 2d 514, 107 S.  [***932]  Ct. 544
(SCALIA, J., dissenting). That same voter might wish to participate in numerous
party primaries, or cast ballots for several candidates, in any given race. The
issue is not ""dual associations,"" post, at 601 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment), but seemingly boundless ones. ""If the concept of
freedom of association is extended"" to a voter's every desire at the ballot box,
""it ceases to be of any analytic use.""  Tashjian, supra, at 235, 93 L. Ed. 2d
514, 107 S. Ct 544 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); cf.  Democratic Party of United
States v. Wisconsin ex rel. La Follette, 450 U.S. 107, 130, 67 L. Ed. 2d 82, 101
S. Ct. 1010 (1981) (Powell, J., dissenting) (""[Not] every conflict between state
law and party rules concerning participation in the nomination process creates a
burden on associational rights"").

But even if Oklahoma's semiclosed primary system burdens an associational right,
the burden is less severe than others this Court has upheld as constitutional.
For instance,  in Timmons, we considered a Minnesota election law prohibiting
multiparty, or ""fusion,"" candidacies in which a candidate appears on the ballot
as the nominee of more than one party.  520 U.S., at 353-354,  [**2037]  137 L.
Ed. 2d 589, 117 S. Ct. 1364. Minnesota's law prevented the New Party, a minor
party under state law, from putting forward the same candidate as a major party.
The New Party challenged the law as unconstitutionally burdening its
associational rights.  Id., at 354-355, 137 L. Ed. 2d 589, 117 S. Ct. 1364. This
Court concluded that the burdens imposed by Minnesota's law -- ""though not
trivial -- [were] not severe.""  Id., at 363, 137 L. Ed. 2d 589, 117 S. Ct. 1364.

The burdens were not severe because the New Party and its members remained free
to govern themselves internally and to communicate with the public as they
wished. Ibid.  [*590]  Minnesota had neither regulated the New Party's internal
decisionmaking process, nor compelled it to associate with voters of any
political persuasion, see  Jones, 530 U.S., at 577, 147 L. Ed. 2d 502, 120 S.
Ct. 2402. The New Party and its members simply could not nominate as their
candidate any of ""those few individuals who both have already agreed to be
another party's candidate and also, if forced to choose, themselves prefer that
other party.""  Timmons, supra, at 363.

The same reasons underpinning our decision in  Timmons show that Oklahoma's
semiclosed primary system burdens the LPO only minimally. As in Timmons,
Oklahoma's law does not regulate the LPO's internal processes, its authority to
exclude unwanted members, or its capacity to communicate with the public. And
just as in Timmons, in which Minnesota conditioned the party's ability to
nominate the candidate of its choice on the candidate's willingness to
disaffiliate from another political party, Oklahoma conditions the party's
ability to welcome a voter into its primary on the voter's willingness to
dissociate from his current party of choice. If anything, it is ""the moment of
choosing the party's nominee"" that matters far more, Jones, 530 U.S., at 575,
for that is ""'the crucial juncture at which the appeal to common principles may
be translated into concerted action, and hence to political power in the
community,'"" ibid. (quoting  Tashjian,  [***933]  479 U.S., at 216, 93 L. Ed. 2d
514, 107 S. Ct. 544). If a party may be prevented from associating with the
candidate of its choice -- its desired ""'standard bearer,'""  Timmons, supra, at
359;  Jones, supra, at 575 -- because that candidate refuses to disaffiliate
from another political party, a party may also be prevented from associating
with a voter who refuses to do the same. Oklahoma's semiclosed primary system
imposes an even slighter burden on voters than on the LPO. Disaffiliation is not
difficult: In general, ""anyone can 'join' a political party merely by asking for
the appropriate ballot at the appropriate time or (at most) by registering
within a state-defined reasonable period of time before an election.""  Jones,
supra,  [*591]  at 596 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). In Oklahoma, registered
members of the Republican, Democratic, and Reform Parties who wish to vote in
the LPO primary simply need to file a form with the county election board
secretary to change their registration. See Okla. Stat. Ann., Tit. 26, § 4-119
(West Supp. 2005). Voters are not ""locked in"" to an unwanted party affiliation,
see  Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U.S. 51, 60-61, 38 L. Ed. 2d 260, 94 S. Ct. 303
(1973), because with only nominal effort they are free to vote in the LPO
primary. For this reason, too, the registration requirement does not unduly
hinder the LPO from associating with members of other parties. To attract
members of other parties, the LPO need only persuade voters to make the minimal
effort necessary to switch parties.

B

Respondents argue that this case is no different from Tashjian. According to
[**2038]  respondents, the burden imposed by Oklahoma's semiclosed primary
system is no less severe than the burden at issue in Tashjian, and hence we must
apply strict scrutiny as we did in  Tashjian. We disagree. At issue in Tashjian
was a Connecticut election statute that required voters to register with a
political party before participating in its primary.  479 U.S., at 210-211, 93
L. Ed. 2d 514, 107 S. Ct. 544. The State's Republican Party, having adopted a
rule that allowed Independent voters to participate in its primary, contended
that Connecticut's closed primary infringed its right to associate with
Independent voters. Ibid. Applying strict scrutiny, this Court found that the
interests Connecticut advanced to justify its ban were not compelling, and thus
that the State could not constitutionally prevent the Republican Party from
inviting into its primary willing Independent voters.  Id., at 217-225, 93 L.
Ed. 2d 514, 107 S. Ct. 544. Respondents' reliance on Tashjian  is unavailing. As
an initial matter, Tashjian applied strict scrutiny with little discussion of
the magnitude of the burdens imposed by Connecticut's closed primary on parties'
and voters' associational  [*592]  rights. Post, at 605 (O'CONNOR, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment). But not every electoral law that
burdens associational rights is subject to strict scrutiny. See, e.g.,  Nader v.
Schaffer, 417 F. Supp. 837, 849 (Conn.) (""There must be more than a minimal
infringement on the rights to vote and of association . . . before strict
judicial review is warranted""), aff'd,  429 U.S. 989, 50 L. Ed. 2d  [***934]
602, 97 S. Ct. 516 (1976). Instead, as our cases since Tashjian have clarified,
strict scrutiny is appropriate only if the burden is severe.  Jones, supra, at
582, 147 L. Ed. 2d 502, 120 S. Ct. 2402;  Timmons, 520 U.S., at 358, 137 L. Ed.
2d 589, 117 S. Ct. 1364. In Tashjian itself, Independent voters could join the
Connecticut Republican Party as late as the day before the primary.  479 U.S.,
at 219, 93 L. Ed. 2d 514, 107 S. Ct. 544. As explained above, supra, at 590-591,
requiring voters to register with a party prior to participating in the party's
primary minimally burdens voters' associational rights.

Nevertheless,   Tashjian is distinguishable. Oklahoma's semiclosed primary
imposes an even less substantial burden than did the Connecticut closed primary
at issue in Tashjian. In Tashjian, this Court identified two ways in which
Connecticut's closed primary limited citizens' freedom of political association.
The first and most important was that it required Independent voters to
affiliate publicly with a party to vote in its primary.  479 U.S., at 216, n. 7,
93 L. Ed. 2d 514, 107 S. Ct. 544. That is not true in this case. At issue here
are voters who have already affiliated publicly with one of Oklahoma's political
parties.  [HN4] These voters need not register as Libertarians to vote in the
LPO's primary; they need only declare themselves Independents, which would leave
them free to participate in any party primary that is open to registered
Independents. See Okla. Stat. Ann., Tit. 26, § 1-104(B)(1) (West 1997).

The second and less important burden imposed by Connecticut's closed primary
system was that political parties could not ""broaden opportunities for joining .
. . by their own act, without any intervening action by potential voters.""
Tashjian, 479 U.S., at 216, n. 7, 93 L. Ed. 2d 514, 107 S. Ct. 544. Voters also
had to act by registering themselves in a particular party. Ibid. That is
[*593]  equally true of Oklahoma's semiclosed primary system: Voters must
register as Libertarians or Independents to participate in the LPO's primary.
However, Tashjian did not characterize this burden alone as severe, and with
good reason.  [HN5] Many electoral regulations, including voter registration
generally, require that voters take some action to participate in the primary
process. See, e.g.,  Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U.S. 752, 760-762,  [**2039]
36 L. Ed. 2d 1, 93 S. Ct. 1245 (1973) (upholding requirement that voters change
party registration 11 months in advance of the primary election). Election laws
invariably ""affect -- at least to some degree -- the individual's right to vote
and his right to associate with others for political ends.""  Anderson v.
Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 788, 75 L. Ed. 2d 547, 103 S. Ct. 1564 (1983).

These minor barriers between voter and party do not compel strict scrutiny. See
Bullock v. Carter, 405 U.S. 134, 143, 31 L. Ed. 2d 92, 92 S. Ct. 849 (1972). To
deem ordinary and widespread burdens like these severe would subject virtually
every electoral regulation to strict scrutiny, hamper the ability of States to
run efficient and equitable elections, and compel federal courts to rewrite
state electoral codes. The Constitution does not require that result, for it is
beyond question ""that  [HN6] States may, and inevitably must, enact reasonable
regulations of parties, elections, and ballots to reduce election- and  [***935]
campaign-related disorder.""  Timmons, supra, at 358, 137 L. Ed. 2d 589, 117 S.
Ct. 1364;  Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 730, 39 L. Ed. 2d 714, 94 S. Ct. 1274
(1974). Oklahoma's semiclosed primary system does not severely burden the
associational rights of the State's citizenry.

C

When a state electoral provision places no heavy burden on associational rights,
""a State's important regulatory interests will usually be enough to justify
reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions.""  Timmons, supra, at 358, 137 L. Ed.
2d 589, 117 S. Ct. 1364 (internal quotation marks omitted);  Anderson, supra, at
788, 75 L. Ed. 2d 547, 103 S. Ct. 1564. Here, Oklahoma's semiclosed primary
advances a number of regulatory interests that this Court recognizes as
important: It [*594]  ""preserves [political] parties as viable and identifiable
interest groups,""  Nader, 417 F. Supp. , at 845; enhances parties'
electioneering and party-building efforts,  id., at 848; and guards against
party raiding and ""sore loser"" candidacies by spurned primary contenders,
Storer, supra, at 735, 39 L. Ed. 2d 714, 94 S. Ct. 1274.

First, as Oklahoma asserts, its semiclosed primary ""preserves the political
parties as viable and identifiable interest groups, insuring that the results of
a primary election, in a broad sense, accurately reflect the voting of the party
members."" Amended and Supplemental Trial Brief of Defendants 10, Record Doc. 63
(quoting without attribution  Nader, supra, at 845). The LPO wishes to open its
primary to registered Republicans and Democrats, who may well vote in numbers
that dwarf the roughly 300 registered LPO voters in Oklahoma. See Memorandum
Opinion 31-32 (at least 95% of voters in LPO's 1996 primary were independents,
not Libertarians). If the LPO is permitted to open its primary to all registered
voters regardless of party affiliation, the candidate who emerges from the LPO
primary may be ""unconcerned with, if not . . . hostile to,"" the political
preferences of the majority of the LPO's members.  Nader, supra, at 846. It does
not matter that the LPO is willing to risk the surrender of its identity in
exchange for electoral success. Oklahoma's interest is independent and concerns
the integrity of its primary system. The State wants to ""avoid primary election
outcomes which would tend to confuse or mislead the general voting population to
the extent [it] relies on party labels as representative of certain ideologies.""
Brief for Petitioners 12 (quoting without attribution  Nader, supra, at 845);
Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central  [**2040] Comm., 489 U.S. 214,
228, 103 L. Ed. 2d 271, 109 S. Ct. 1013 (1989).

Moreover, this Court has found that  [HN7] ""'in facilitating the effective
operation of [a] democratic government, a state might reasonably classify voters
or candidates according to political affiliations.'""  Nader, supra, at 845-846
(quoting  Ray v. Blair, 343 U.S. 214, 226, n. 14, 96 L. Ed. 894, 72 S. Ct. 654
(1952)). But for that  [*595]  classification to mean much, Oklahoma must be
allowed to limit voters' ability to roam among parties' primaries. The purpose
of party registration is to provide ""a minimal demonstration by the voter that
he has some 'commitment' to the party in whose primary he wishes to
participate.""  [***936]   Nader, supra, at 847. That commitment is lessened if
party members may retain their registration in one party while voting in another
party's primary. Opening the LPO's primary to all voters not only would render
the LPO's imprimatur an unreliable index of its candidate's actual political
philosophy, but it also ""would make registered party affiliations significantly
less meaningful in the Oklahoma primary election system."" Memorandum Opinion 59.
Oklahoma reasonably has concluded that opening the LPO's primary to all voters
regardless of party affiliation would undermine the crucial role of political
parties in the primary process. Cf.  Jones, 530 U.S., at 574, 147 L. Ed. 2d 502,
120 S. Ct. 2402.

Second, Oklahoma's semiclosed primary system, by retaining the importance of
party affiliation, aids in parties' electioneering and party-building efforts.
""It is common experience that direct solicitation of party members -- by mail,
telephone, or face-to-face contact, and by the candidates themselves or by their
active supporters -- is part of any primary election campaign.""  Nader, supra,
at 848. Yet parties' voter turnout efforts depend in large part on accurate
voter registration rolls. See, e.g.,  Council of Alternative Political Parties
v. State Div. of Elections, 344 N. J. Super. 225, 231-232, 781 A.2d 1041, 1045
(2001) (""It is undisputed that the voter registration lists, with voter
affiliation information, . . . provide essential information to the [party state
committees] for other campaign and party-building activities, including
canvassing and fundraising"").

When voters are no longer required to disaffiliate before participating in other
parties' primaries, voter registration rolls cease to be an accurate reflection
of voters' political preferences. And without registration rolls that accurately
[*596]  reflect likely or potential primary voters, parties risk expending
precious resources to turn out party members who may have decided to cast their
votes elsewhere. See Brief for State of South Dakota et al. as Amici Curiae
20-21. If encouraging citizens to vote is an important state interest, see
Jones, supra, at 587, 147 L. Ed. 2d 502, 120 S. Ct. 2402 (KENNEDY, J.,
concurring), then Oklahoma is entitled to protect parties' ability to plan their
primaries for a stable group of voters. Tr. of Oral Arg. 26.

Third,  Oklahoma has an interest in preventing party raiding, or ""the organized
switching of blocs of voters from one party to another in order to manipulate
the outcome of the other party's primary election.""  Anderson, 460 U.S., at
788-789, n. 9, 75 L. Ed. 2d 547, 103 S. Ct. 1564,   Jones, supra, at 572, 147 L.
Ed. 2d 502, 120 S. Ct. 2402. For example, if the outcome of the Democratic Party
primary were not in doubt, Democrats might vote in the LPO primary for the
candidate most likely to siphon off votes from the Republican candidate in the
general election. Or a Democratic primary contender who senses defeat might
launch a ""sore loser"" candidacy by defecting to the LPO primary, taking with him
loyal Democratic voters, and thus undermining the Democratic Party in the
[***937]   [**2041]  general election. 4  Storer, 415 U.S., at 735, 39 L. Ed. 2d
714, 94 S. Ct. 1274. Oklahoma has an interest in ""tempering the destabilizing
effects"" of precisely this sort of ""party splintering and excessive
factionalism.""  [*597]   Timmons, 520 U.S., at 367, 137 L. Ed. 2d 589, 117 S.
Ct. 1364 ; cf.  Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U.S. 109, 144-145, 92 L. Ed. 2d 85, 106
S. Ct. 2797 (1986) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment). Oklahoma's semiclosed
primary system serves that interest by discouraging voters from temporarily
defecting from another party to vote in the LPO primary. While the State's
interest will not justify ""unreasonably exclusionary restrictions,""  Timmons,
520 U.S., at 367, 137 L. Ed. 2d 589, 117 S. Ct. 1364, we have ""repeatedly upheld
reasonable, politically neutral regulations"" like Oklahoma's semiclosed primary
law,  id., at 369, 137 L. Ed. 2d 589, 117 S. Ct. 1364 (internal quotation marks
omitted).

4 To be most effective, a spurned candidate would have to defect in advance of
the primary election. Before a candidate may file for nomination by a political
party to any state or county office in Oklahoma, generally the candidate must
have been a registered member of the party for six months prior to filing. See
Okla. Stat. Ann., Tit. 26, § 5-105(A) (West 1997). However, the registration
period is only 15 days for candidates from parties, like the LPO, whose lack of
electoral support means that they must regularly petition to be recognized as
political parties. Ibid.; see also §§ 1-108, 1-109 (West Supp. 2005) (Oklahoma's
ballot access requirements). But even though candidates may defect up to two
weeks before the primary, registered Republican and Democratic voters may not
change their party affiliation after June 1, roughly eight weeks before the
primary. See § 4-119; see also § 1-102 (setting primary on last Tuesday of
July).

Beyond their challenge to Oklahoma's semiclosed primary law, § 1-104,
respondents have expanded their challenge before this Court to include other
Oklahoma election laws. Respondents contend that several of the State's ballot
access and voter registration laws, taken together, severely burden their
associational rights by effectively preventing them from changing their party

for relief under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, Apr. 24, 1963,
[1970] 21 U.S. T. 77, 100-101, T. I. A. S. No. 6820, without regard to
procedural default doctrines; and second, whether a federal court should give
effect, as a matter of judicial comity and uniform treaty interpretation, to the
ICJ's judgment.  543 U.S. 1032, 160 L. Ed. 2d 518, 125 S. Ct. 686 (2004). After
we granted certiorari, Medellin filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus
in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, relying in part upon a memorandum from
President George W. Bush that was issued after we granted certiorari. This
state-court proceeding may provide Medellin with the very reconsideration of his
Vienna Convention claim that he now seeks in the present proceeding. The merits
briefing in this case also has revealed a number of hurdles Medellin must
surmount before qualifying for federal habeas relief in this proceeding, based
on the resolution of the questions he has presented here. For these reasons we
dismiss the writ as improvidently granted. See  Ticor Title Ins. Co. v. Brown,
511 U.S. 117, 121-122, 128 L. Ed. 2d 33, 114 S. Ct. 1359 (1994) (per curiam);
The Monrosa v. Carbon Black Export, Inc., 359 U.S. 180, 183-184, 3 L. Ed. 2d
723, 79 S. Ct. 710 (1959);  Goins v. United States, 306 U.S. 622, 83 L. Ed.
1027, 59 S. Ct. 783 (1939).

Medellin, a Mexican national, confessed to participating in the gang rape and
murder of two girls in 1993.  He was convicted and sentenced to death, and the
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed on direct appeal. Medellin then filed a
state habeas corpus action, claiming for the first time that Texas failed to
notify him of his right to consular access as required by the Vienna Convention.
The state trial court rejected this claim, and the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals summarily affirmed.

Medellin then filed this federal habeas corpus petition, again raising the
Vienna Convention claim. The District Court denied the petition. Subsequently,
while Medellin's application to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for a
certificate of appealability was pending, see 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c),  [*663]  the
ICJ issued its decision in Case Concerning Avena and other Mexican Nationals
(Mex. v. U.S.), 2004 I. C. J. No. 128 (Judgment of Mar. 31), in which  [**2090]
the Republic of Mexico had alleged violations of the Vienna Convention with
respect to Medellin and other Mexican nationals facing the death penalty in the
United States.  [HN1] The ICJ determined that the Vienna Convention guaranteed
individually enforceable rights, that the United  [***987]  States had violated
those rights, and that the United States must ""provide, by means of its own
choosing, review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences of the
[affected] Mexican nationals"" to determine whether the violations ""caused actual
prejudice,"" without allowing procedural default rules to bar such review.  Id.,
PP 121-122, 153.

The Court of Appeals denied Medellin's application for a certificate of
appealability. It did so based on Medellin's procedural default, see  Breard v.
Greene, 523 U.S. 371, 375, 140 L. Ed. 2d 529, 118 S. Ct. 1352 (1998) (per
curiam), and its prior holdings that the Vienna Convention did not create an
individually enforceable right, see, e.g.,  United States v. Jimenez-Nava, 243
F.3d 192, 195 (CA5 2001).  371 F.3d 270 (CA5 2004). While acknowledging the
existence of the ICJ's Avena judgment, the court gave no dispositive effect to
that judgment.

More than two months after we granted certiorari, and a month before oral
argument in this case, President Bush issued a memorandum that stated the United
States would discharge its international obligations under the Avena judgment by
""having State courts give effect to the [ICJ] decision in accordance with
general principles of comity in cases filed by the 51 Mexican nationals
addressed in that decision."" George W. Bush, Memorandum for the Attorney General
(Feb. 28, 2005), App. 2 to Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 9a. Relying
on this memorandum and the Avena judgment as separate bases for relief that were
not available at the time of his first state habeas corpus action, Medellin
filed a successive state application for a writ of habeas corpus  [*664]  just
four days before oral argument here. That state proceeding may provide Medellin
with the review and reconsideration of his Vienna Convention claim that the ICJ
required, and that Medellin now seeks in this proceeding. This new development,
as well as the factors discussed below, leads us to dismiss the writ of
certiorari as improvidently granted. 1

1 Of course Medellin, or the State of Texas, can seek certiorari in this Court
from the Texas courts' disposition of the state habeas corpus application. In
that instance, this Court would in all likelihood have an opportunity to review
the Texas courts' treatment of the President's memorandum and Case Concerning
Avena and other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U.S.), 2004 I. C. J. No. 128
(Judgment of Mar. 31), unencumbered by the issues that arise from the procedural
posture of this action.

 There are several threshold issues that could independently preclude federal
habeas relief for Medellin, and thus render advisory or academic our
consideration of the questions presented. These issues are not free from doubt.

First, even accepting, arguendo, the ICJ's construction of the Vienna
Convention's consular access provisions, a violation of those provisions may not
be cognizable in a federal habeas proceeding. In  Reed v. Farley, 512 U.S. 339,
129 L. Ed. 2d 277, 114 S. Ct. 2291 (1994), this Court recognized that  [HN2] a
violation of federal statutory rights ranked among the ""nonconstitutional lapses
we have held not cognizable in a postconviction proceeding"" unless they meet the
""fundamental defect"" test announced in our decision in  Hill v. United States,
368 U.S. 424, 428, 7 L. Ed. 2d 417, 82 S. Ct. 468 (1962).  512 U.S., at 349
(plurality  [***988]  opinion); see also  id., 512 U.S. at 355-356, 129 L. Ed.
2d 277, 114 S. Ct. 2291 (SCALIA, J.,  [**2091]  concurring in part and
concurring in judgment). In order for Medellin to obtain federal habeas relief,
Medellin must therefore establish that  Reed does not bar his treaty claim.

Second,  [HN3] with respect to any claim the state court ""adjudicated on the
merits,"" habeas relief in federal court is available only if such adjudication
""was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal
law, as  [*665]  determined by the Supreme Court."" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1); see
Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U.S. 19, 22-27, 154 L. Ed. 2d 279, 123 S. Ct. 357
(2002) (per curiam). The state habeas court, which disposed of the case before
the ICJ rendered its judgment in Avena, arguably ""adjudicated on the merits""
three claims. It found that the Vienna Convention did not create individual,
judicially enforceable rights and that state procedural default rules barred
Medellin's consular access claim. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the
state trial court found that Medellin ""failed to show that he was harmed by any
lack of notification to the Mexican consulate concerning his arrest for capital
murder; [Medellin] was provided with effective legal representation upon [his]
request; and [his] constitutional rights were safeguarded."" App. to Pet. for
Cert. 56a. 2 Medellin would have to overcome the deferential standard with
regard to all of these findings before obtaining federal habeas relief on his
Vienna Convention claim. 3

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - Footnotes - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

2 The Federal District Court reviewing that finding observed:

""Medellin's allegations of prejudice are speculative. The police officers
informed Medellin of his right to legal representation before he confessed to
involvement in the murders. Medellin waived his right to advisement by an
attorney. Medellin does not challenge the voluntary nature of his confession.
There is no indication that, if informed of his consular rights, Medellin would
not have waived those rights as he did his right to counsel. Medellin fails to
establish a 'causal connection between the [Vienna Convention] violation and
[his] statements.'"" App. to Pet. for Cert. 84a-85a (brackets in original).

3 In  Breard v. Greene, 523 U.S. 371, 140 L. Ed. 2d 529, 118 S. Ct. 1352 (1998)
(per curiam), we addressed the claim that Virginia failed to notify a Paraguayan
national of his Vienna Convention right to consular access. In denying various
writs, motions, and stay applications, we noted that  [HN4] the Vienna
Convention ""arguably confers on an individual the right to consular assistance
following arrest""; that Virginia's procedural default doctrine applied to the
Vienna Convention claim; and that a successful Vienna Convention claimant likely
must demonstrate prejudice.  Id., 523 U.S. at 375-377, 140 L. Ed. 2d 529, 118 S.
Ct. 1352. At the time of our Breard decision, however, we confronted no final
ICJ adjudication.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Third,  [HN5] a habeas corpus petitioner generally cannot enforce a ""new rule""
of law.  Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 103 L. Ed. 2d 334, 109 S. Ct. 1060 (1989)
.  [*666]  Before relief could be granted, then, we would be obliged to decide
whether or how the Avena judgment bears on our ordinary ""new rule""
jurisprudence.

Fourth, Medellin requires a certificate of appealability in order to pursue the
merits of his claim on appeal. 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(1) .  [HN6] A certificate of
appealability may be granted only where there is ""a substantial showing of the
denial of a constitutional right."" § 2253(c)(2) (emphasis added). To obtain the
necessary certificate of appealability to proceed in the Court of Appeals,
Medellin must demonstrate that his allegation of a treaty violation could
satisfy this standard. See  Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 483,  [***989]  146
L. Ed. 2d 542, 120 S. Ct. 1595 (2000).

Fifth,  [HN7] Medellin can seek federal habeas relief only on claims that have
been exhausted in state court. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 2254(b)(1)(A), (b)(3). To gain
relief  [**2092]  based on the President's memorandum or ICJ judgments, Medellin
would have to show that he exhausted all available state-court remedies. 4

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - Footnotes - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

4 On March 8, 2005, Medellin filed a successive state habeas action based on
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 11.071§ 5(a)(1), (Vernon 2005), claiming that
both the President's memorandum and the Avena judgment independently require the
Texas court to grant review and reconsideration of his Vienna Convention claim.
See Subsequent Application for Post-Conviction Writ of Habeas Corpus in Ex Parte
Medellin, Trial Cause Nos. 67,5429 and 67,5430 (Tex. Crim. App.), p. 6 (filed
Mar. 24, 2005) (""First, the President's determination requires this Court to
comply with the Avena Judgment and remand Mr. Medellin's case for the mandated
review and reconsideration of his Vienna Convention claim. Second, the Avena
Judgment on its own terms provides the rule of decision in Mr. Medellin's case
and should be given direct effect by this Court"").
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 In light of the possibility that the Texas courts will provide Medellin with
the review he seeks pursuant to the Avena judgment and the President's
memorandum, and the potential for review in this Court once the Texas courts
have heard and decided Medellin's pending action, we think it would be unwise to
reach and resolve the multiple hindrances  [*667]  to dispositive answers to the
questions here presented. Accordingly, we dismiss the writ as improvidently
granted.

It is so ordered.

CONCUR BY: GINSBURG

CONCUR

JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins as to Part II, concurring.

Petitioner Jose Medellin, a Mexican national, was arrested, detained, tried,
convicted, and sentenced to death in Texas without being informed of rights
accorded him under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, Apr. 24, 1963,
[1970] 21 U.S. T. 77, 100-101, T. I. A. S. No. 6820. The Convention called for
prompt notice of Medellin's arrest to the Mexican consul. Medellin could then
seek consular advice and assistance.

After unsuccessful challenges to his conviction and sentence, first in state
court, later in federal court, Medellin sought this Court's review. His petition
for certiorari, which this Court granted, rests primarily on a judgment rendered
by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on March 31, 2004: Case Concerning
Avena and other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U.S.), 2004 I. C. J. No. 128 (Avena).
Medellin's petition also draws support from an ICJ judgment of the same order
earlier rendered against the United States: LaGrand Case (F. R. G. v. U.S.),
2001 I. C. J. 466 (Judgment of June 27) (LaGrand). The ICJ held in Avena that
the failure to accord Vienna Convention rights to Medellin and other similarly
situated Mexican nationals necessitated review and reconsideration of their
convictions and sentences by United States courts. Further, the ICJ specified,
procedural default doctrines could not be invoked to bar the required review and
reconsideration. Medellin sought certiorari on two questions:  [***990]  (1) Are
courts in the United States bound by the Avena judgment; (2) Should courts in
the United States give effect to the Avena and LaGrand judgments [*668]  ""in the
interest of judicial comity and uniform treaty interpretation."" Brief for
Petitioner i.

On February 28, 2005, President Bush announced:


     ""The United States will discharge its international obligations under
     the decision of the International Court of Justice in [Avena], by
     having State courts give effect to the decision in accordance with
     general principles of comity."" Memorandum for the Attorney General
     (Feb. 28, 2005), App. 2 to Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 9a
     (hereinafter President's Memorandum).


 [**2093] Medellin thereupon moved to stay further proceedings in this Court
pending his pursuit of remedies in Texas court, as contemplated by the
President's Memorandum. I would grant Medellin's stay motion as the most
conservative among courses the Court might take. That ""least change"" measure,
however, has not garnered majority support.

I

The Court is divided between two responses to Medellin's petition in light of
the President's Memorandum: (1) remand to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit for initial rulings on a host of difficult issues, post, at 684, 690
(O'CONNOR, J., dissenting), recognizing that court's prerogative to hold the
case in abeyance pending Medellin's pursuit of relief in state court, post, at
690; or (2) dismiss the writ, recognizing that ""in all likelihood"" this Court
would be positioned ""to review the Texas courts' treatment of the President's
Memorandum and [the Avena judgment] unencumbered by the [threshold] issues that
arise from the procedural posture of this action,"" ante, at 664, n. 1. The
former course would invite the Fifth Circuit to conduct proceedings rival to
those recently launched in state court, or to put the case on hold, a cautionary
measure this Court itself is unwilling take. The latter would leave nothing
pending here, but would enable this Court ultimately to resolve, clearly and
cleanly, the  [*669]  controlling effect of the ICJ's Avena judgment, shorn of
procedural hindrances that pervade the instant action.

II

For the reasons stated below, I join the Court's election to dismiss the writ as
improvidently granted in light of the President's Memorandum and the state-court
proceeding instituted in accordance with that Memorandum. I do so recognizing
that this Court would have jurisdiction to review the final judgment in the
Texas proceedings, and at that time, to rule definitively on ""the Nation's
obligation under the judgment of the ICJ if that should prove necessary."" Post,
at 691 (SOUTER, J., dissenting).

The principal dissent would return the case to the Fifth Circuit leaving
unresolved a bewildering array of questions. See post, at 684 (opinion of
O'CONNOR, J.) (describing issues not touched by this Court as ""difficult"").
Among inquiries left open ""for further proceedings"": Is a certificate of
appealability (COA) available when the applicant is not complaining of ""the
[***991]  denial of a constitutional right""? Post, at 677 (O'CONNOR, J.,
dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also post at 677-679; cf.
ante, at 666. What directions must a lower court take from  Teague v. Lane, 489
U.S. 288, 103 L. Ed. 2d 334, 109 S. Ct. 1060 (1989), and perhaps from  Reed v.
Farley, 512 U.S. 339, 129 L. Ed. 2d 277, 114 S. Ct. 2291 (1994), and  Hill v.
United States, 368 U.S. 424, 7 L. Ed. 2d 417, 82 S. Ct. 468 (1962) Post, at
681-682 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting); cf. ante, at 664-666. Is it open to a lower
court to resolve the ""conflict between Avena and [this Court's] decision in
Breard v. Greene, 523 U.S. 371, 376, 140 L. Ed. 2d 529, 118 S. Ct. 1352 (1998)
(per curiam)""? Post, at 684 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). 1 Has Medellin exhausted
state avenues for relief, see ante, at 666; Rhines v. Weber, ante, p. 269;  Rose
v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 518-520, [**2094]  102 S. Ct. 1198, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379
(1982); cf. post, at 682-683, n. 1 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting), given that the
Avena  [*670]  judgment and the President's response to it postdate the
rejection of Medellin's pleas in Texas proceedings? While contentious
preliminary issues clog final determination of Medellin's claim for federal
habeas relief based on the ICJ's judgments, action by the Texas courts could
render the entire array of questions moot. See post, at 692 (SOUTER, J.,
dissenting) (""Action in the Texas courts might remove any occasion to proceed
under the federal habeas petition."").

Further, at odds with the President's determination to ""give effect to the
[Avena] decision in accordance with general principles of comity,"" President's
Memorandum, and in conspicuous conflict with the law of judgments, see
Restatement (Second)  of Conflict of Laws § 98 (1988); Restatement (Third) of
Foreign Relations Law of the United States § 481 (1986); Restatement (Second) of
Judgments § 17 (1980), the principal dissent would instruct the Court of Appeals
to ""hold up the Avena interpretation of the [Vienna Convention] against the
domestic court's own conclusions."" Post, at 684 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.). But
cf. ALI, Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments: Analysis and Proposed
Federal Statute § 2, Comment d, p. 38 (2005) (""[A] judgment entitled to
recognition will not be reexamined on the merits by a second court.""). It is the
long-recognized general rule that, when a judgment binds or is respected as a
matter of comity, a ""let's see if we agree"" approach is out of order. See
Hilton v. Guyot, 159 U.S. 113, 202-203, 40 L. Ed. 95, 16 S. Ct. 139 (1895)
(where ""comity of this nation"" calls for recognition of a judgment rendered
abroad, ""the merits of the case should not . . . be tried afresh . . . upon the
mere assertion . . . that the judgment was erroneous in law or in fact""); see
also Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 106 (1969) (""A judgment will be
recognized and enforced in other states even though an error of fact or of law
was made in the proceedings  [***992]  before judgment . . . .""); id., § 106,

nations . . . .""); Reese, The Status in This Country of Judgments Rendered

fact or of law.""). 2

2 The principal dissent maintains that the second question on which we granted
certiorari asks ""whether and what weight [short of binding effect] American
courts should give to Avena,"" in the course of independently interpreting the
treaty, ""perhaps for sake of uniform treaty interpretation."" Post, at 684 (
opinion of O'CONNOR, J.); see post, at 684-685, and n. 2 (same). Significantly,
Medellin chose not to break out for discrete review in this Court questions
underlying and subsumed in the ICJ's judgments in Avena, 2004 I. C. J. No. 128
(Judgment of Mar. 31), and LaGrand, 2001 I. C. J. 466 (Judgment of June 27),
i.e., whether the Vienna Convention ""creates a judicially enforceable individual
right"" and whether it ""sometimes requires state procedural default rules to be
set aside so that the treaty can be given 'full effect,'"" post, at 673
(O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). Nor does Medellin's invocation of ""international
comity,"" Brief for Petitioner 45, or his plea for ""uniform treaty
interpretation,"" id., at 48, seek this Court's independent interpretation of the
Convention. Instead, he urges that comity is accorded, and uniformity achieved,
by recognizing as authoritative the ICJ's interpretation as elaborated in
successive judgments against the United States. See id., at 49 (""Given its
consent to the ICJ's jurisdiction, the United States should treat as
authoritative any interpretation or application of the Convention by that court
.""); see also Reply Brief 16 (observing that the United States ""agreed that the
ICJ would have final authority to resolve disputes over the treaty's
interpretation and application"" (emphasis added)).
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  [**2095]  Troubling as well, the principal dissent provides no clear
instructions to the Court of Appeals on which of the several questions the
dissenters would remit to that court comes first, which others ""should be part
of"" the COA determination, post, at 682 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.), and which are
meet for adjudication only if, as, or when a COA is granted. The participation
of a federal court in the fray at this point, moreover, risks disturbance of, or
collision with, the proceeding Medellin has commenced in Texas. The principal
dissent appears ultimately to acknowledge that concern by observing that the
Fifth Circuit might ""hold the case on its docket until Medellin's successive
petition was resolved in state court."" Post, at 690 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.);
see also  [*672]  post, at 692 (SOUTER, J., dissenting); post, at 694 (BREYER,
J., dissenting). But given this Court's unwillingness to put the case on hold
here, one might ask what justifies parking the case, instead, in the Court of
Appeals.

The per curiam opinion which I join rests on two complementary grounds. First,
the Texas proceeding ""may provide Medellin with the very reconsideration of his
Vienna Convention claim that he now seeks in the present proceeding."" Ante, at
662. Second, the instant proceeding comes to us freighted with formidable
threshold issues, ante, at 664-666, that deter definitive answers to the
questions presented in the petition for certiorari.

Petitioner's recent filing in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals raises two
discrete bases for relief that were not previously available for presentation to
a state forum: the ICJ's Avena judgment and the President's Memorandum. See
Subsequent Application for Post-Conviction Writ of Habeas Corpus in Ex Parte
[***993]  Medellin, Trial Cause Nos. 67,5429 and 67,5430 (Tex. Crim. App.), p.
13 (filed Mar. 24, 2005) (""President Bush's determination and the Avena Judgment
constitute two separate sources of binding federal law.""). The Texas courts are
now positioned immediately to adjudicate these cleanly presented issues in the
first instance. In turn, it will be this Court's responsibility, at the proper
time and if need be, to provide the ultimate answers.

DISSENT BY: O'CONNOR; SOUTER; BREYER

DISSENT

JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE SOUTER, and JUSTICE BREYER
join, dissenting.

Jose Ernesto Medellin offered proof to the Court of Appeals that reasonable
jurists would find debatable or wrong the District Court's disposition of his
claim that Texas violated his rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular
Relations and that he is thereby entitled to review and reconsideration of his
conviction and sentence. Three specific issues deserve further consideration:
(1) whether the International Court of Justice's judgment in Medellin's favor,
Case  [*673]  Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U.S.), 2004
I. C. J. No. 128 (Judgment of Mar. 31), is binding on American courts; (2)
whether Article 36(1)(b) of the Convention creates a judicially enforceable
individual right; and (3) whether Article 36(2) of the Convention sometimes
requires state procedural default rules to be set aside so that the treaty can
be given ""full effect."" Accordingly, I would vacate the denial of a certificate
of appealability and remand for resolution of these issues.

The Court dismisses the writ (and terminates federal proceedings) on the basis
of speculation: Medellin might obtain relief in new state court proceedings --
because of the President's recent memorandum  [**2096]  about whose
constitutionality the Court remains rightfully agnostic, or he might be unable
to secure ultimate relief in federal court -- because of questions about whose
resolution the Court is likewise, rightfully, undecided. These tentative
predictions are not, in my view, reason enough to avoid questions that are as
compelling now as they were when we granted a writ of certiorari, and that
remain properly before this Court. It seems to me unsound to avoid questions of
national importance when they are bound to recur. I respectfully dissent.

Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations guarantees open
channels of communication between detained foreign nationals and their
consulates in signatory countries:


     ""If he so requests, the competent authorities of the receiving State
     shall, without delay, inform the consular post of the sending State
     if, within its consular district, a national of that State is arrested
     or committed to prison or to custody pending trial or is detained in
     any other manner. Any communication addressed to the consular post by
     the person arrested, in prison, custody or detention shall also be
     forwarded by the said authorities  [*674]  without delay. The said
     authorities shall inform the person concerned without delay of his
     rights under this sub-paragraph."" Vienna Convention on Consular

In this country, the individual States' (often confessed) noncompliance with the
treaty has been a vexing problem. See, e.g.,  United States v. Emuegbunam, 268
F.3d 377, 391 (CA6 2001) (discussing cases about Vienna Convention violations).
It has three times been the subject of proceedings in the International Court of
Justice (ICJ). See Case Concerning Vienna Convention on Consular Relations

U.S.), 2001 I. C. J. 466 (Judgment of June 27); Avena, supra. The problem may
have considerable ramifications, because foreign nationals are regularly subject
to state criminal justice systems. For example, in 2003, over 56,000 noncitizens
were held in state prisons. Noncitizens accounted for over 10% of the prison
populations in California, New York, and Arizona. U.S. Dept. of Justice, Bureau

Petitioner Michael Donald Dodd was indicted on June 25, 1993, for knowingly and
intentionally engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise in violation of 21
U.S.C. §§ 841 and 846, conspiring to possess with intent to distribute marijuana
in violation of § 841(a)(1), conspiring to  [***348]  possess with intent to
distribute cocaine in violation of § 841(a)(1), and 16 counts of using and
possessing a passport obtained by false statement in violation of 18 U.S.C. §
1546(a).  He was convicted of all counts except the cocaine charge, and was
sentenced to 360 months' imprisonment followed by five years of supervised
release.  The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed on May 7, 1997.
111 F.3d 867 (per curiam). Because Dodd did not file a petition for certiorari,
his conviction became final on August 6, 1997.  See Clay v. United States, 537
U.S. 522, 525, 155 L. Ed. 2d 88, 123 S. Ct. 1072 (2003).

On April 4, 2001, more than three years after his conviction became final, Dodd
filed a pro se motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 seeking to set aside his conviction
for knowingly and intentionally engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise,
based on our decision in [**2481]   Richardson v. United States, 526 U.S. 813,
143 L. Ed. 2d 985, 119 S. Ct. 1707 (1999).  Richardson held that a jury must
agree unanimously that a defendant is guilty of each of the specific violations
that together constitute the continuing criminal enterprise.  Id., at 815, 143
L. Ed. 2d 985, 119 S. Ct. 1707.  Dodd argued, among other things, that he was
entitled to relief because his jury had not been instructed that they had to
agree unanimously on each predicate violation.  App. 9.  The District Court
dismissed Dodd's § 2255 motion as time barred. Id., at 11-15.  Because
Richardson had been decided more than one year before Dodd filed his motion, the
court held that the motion was untimely; it also rejected Dodd's request for
equitable tolling.  App. 13-15.

[*356]  Dodd appealed, arguing that the limitation period in § 2255, P 6(3), did
not begin to run until April 19, 2002, when the Court of Appeals for the
Eleventh Circuit held in Ross v. United States, 289 F.3d 677 (per curiam), that
the right recognized in Richardson applies retroactively to cases on collateral
review. The Eleventh Circuit held that the limitation period began to run on
""the date the Supreme Court initially recognizes the right""--the date Richardson
was decided--and accordingly affirmed the dismissal of Dodd's motion as time
barred.  365 F.3d 1273, 1283 (2004).

We granted certiorari, 543 U.S. 999, 160 L. Ed. 2d 456, 125 S. Ct. 607 (2004),
to resolve a conflict in the Courts of Appeals over when the limitation period
in P 6(3) begins to run. Compare, e.g., 365 F.3d at 1283 (case below) (period
runs from date of Supreme Court decision initially recognizing right asserted);
and United States v. Lopez, 248 F.3d 427, 432-433 (CA5 2001) (same), with Pryor
v. United States, 278 F.3d 612, 616 (CA6 2002) (period does not begin to run
until right has been held retroactively applicable to cases on collateral
review); and United States v. Valdez, 195 F.3d 544, 547-548 (CA9 1999) (same).

II

Section 2255, P 6, provides:


      [HN3] ""A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under
     this section.  The limitation period shall run from the latest of--

     ""(1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final;

     ""(2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion created
     [***349]  by governmental action in violation of the Constitution or
     laws of the United States is removed, if the movant was prevented from
     making a motion by such governmental action;

     ""(3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by
     the Supreme Court, if that right has been  [*357]  newly recognized by
     the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on
     collateral review; or

     ""(4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims
     presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due
     diligence.""



In most cases, the operative date from which the limitation period is measured
will be the one identified in P 6(1): ""the date on which the judgment of
conviction becomes final."" Ibid.; see also Clay, supra, at 524, 155 L. Ed. 2d
88, 123 S. Ct. 1072.  But later filings are permitted where subparagraphs
(2)-(4) apply.  This case involves  [HN4] P 6(3), which gives § 2255 applicants
one year from ""the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by
the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court
and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review."" Dodd contends
that under subparagraph (3), the limitation period runs from the date on which
the right asserted was made retroactively applicable.  [**2482]  The United
States, on the other hand, argues that it runs from the date on which this Court
initially recognized the right asserted.

[***LEdHR1A] [1B]  [***LEdHR2A] [2A] We believe that the text of P 6(3) settles
this dispute.  It unequivocally identifies one, and only one, date from which
the 1-year limitation period is measured: ""the date on which the right asserted
was initially recognized by the Supreme Court.""  [HN5] We ""must presume that
[the] legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it
says there.""  Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253-254, 117 L.
Ed. 2d 391, 112 S. Ct. 1146 (1992).   [HN6] What Congress has said in P 6(3) is
clear: An applicant has one year from the date on which the right he asserts was
initially recognized by this Court.

Dodd urges us to adopt a different interpretation.  He contends that the second
clause in P 6(3) affects the applicable date under that provision.  He reads P
6(3) as containing ""three distinct prerequisites"" that ""must be satisfied before
the limitation period begins."" Brief for Petitioner 8.  Those three
prerequisites are: (1) the right asserted by the  [*358]  applicant ""was
initially recognized"" by this Court; (2) this Court ""newly recognized"" the
right; and (3) a court must have ""made"" the right ""retroactively applicable to
cases on collateral review. "" Id., at 13-14 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Because the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit did not hold the right
recognized in Richardson v. United States, 526 U.S. 813, 143 L. Ed. 2d 985, 119
S. Ct. 1707 (1999), retroactively applicable until April 19, 2002, when it
decided Ross, 289 F.3d 677, Dodd contends that he had until April 19, 2003--one
year from the date when all three prerequisites were satisfied--to file his §
2255 motion.

[***LEdHR1A] [1C]  [***LEdHR3] [3] Dodd's interpretation does not square with
the only natural reading of the text.  Paragraph 6(3) identifies one date and
one date only as the date from which the 1-year limitation period runs: ""the
date on  [***350]  which the right asserted was initially recognized by the
Supreme Court."" Dodd's reliance on the second clause to identify the operative
date is misplaced.  That clause--""if that right has been newly recognized by the
Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral
review""--imposes a condition on the applicability of this subsection.  See
Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1124 (1993) (the definition of ""if""
is ""in the event that"" or ""on condition that"").  It therefore limits P 6(3)'s
application to cases in which applicants are seeking to assert rights ""newly
recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on
collateral review."" § 2255, P 6(3).  That means that P 6(3)'s date--""the date on
which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court""--does
not apply at all if the conditions in the second clause--the right ""has been
newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases
on collateral review""--have not been satisfied.  As long as the conditions in
the second clause are satisfied so that P 6(3) applies in the first place, that
clause has no impact whatsoever on the date from which the 1-year limitation
period in P 6(3) begins to run. Thus, if this Court decides a case recognizing a
new right, a federal prisoner  [*359]  seeking to assert that right will have
one year from this Court's decision within which to file his § 2255 motion.  He
may take advantage of the date in the first clause of P 6(3) only if the
conditions in the second clause are met.

[***LEdHR1A] [1D]  [***LEdHR4] [4] We recognize that the statute of limitations
in P 6(3) makes it difficult for applicants filing second or successive § 2255
motions to obtain relief.   [HN7] The limitation period in P 6(3) applies to
""all motions"" under § 2255, initial motions as well [**2483]  as second or
successive ones.   [HN8] Section 2255, P 8(2), narrowly restricts an applicant's
ability to file a second or successive motion.  An applicant may file a second
or successive motion only in limited circumstances, such as where he seeks to
take advantage of ""a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases
on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable."" §
2255, P 8(2).  Dodd points out that this Court rarely decides that a new rule is
retroactively applicable within one year of initially recognizing that right.
Thus, because of the interplay between PP 8(2) and 6(3), an applicant who files
a second or successive motion seeking to take advantage of a new rule of
constitutional law will be time barred except in the rare case in which this
Court announces a new rule of constitutional law and makes it retroactive within
one year.

[***LEdHR1A] [1E]  [***LEdHR2A] [2B] Although we recognize the potential for
harsh results in some cases, we are not free to rewrite the statute that
Congress has enacted.   [HN9] ""[W]hen the statute's language is plain, the sole
function of the courts--at least where the disposition required by the text is
not absurd--is to enforce it according to its terms.""  Hartford Underwriters
Ins. Co. v. Union Planters Bank, N. A., 530 U.S. 1, 6, 147 L. Ed. 2d 1, 120 S.
Ct. 1942 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).  See also Tyler v. Cain, 533
U.S. 656, 663, n. 5, 150 L. Ed. 2d 632, 121 S. Ct. 2478 (2001) (""[E]ven if we
disagreed with the legislative decision to establish stringent procedural
requirements for retroactive application of new rules,  [***351]  we do not have
license to question the decision on policy grounds"").  The disposition required
by the text here, though strict, is not absurd.  It is for Congress, not this
Court, to amend the statute if it  [*360]  believes that the interplay of PP
8(2) and 6(3) of § 2255 unduly restricts federal prisoners' ability to file
second or successive motions.

Justice Stevens would hold, contrary to the plain text, that the limitation
period in P 6(3) begins to run when the right asserted is made retroactive, see
post, at 369, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 356 (dissenting opinion), because he assumes
that ""the most natural reading of the statutory text would make it possible for
the limitations period to expire before the cause of action accrues,"" post, at
361, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 351.  Justice Stevens analogizes this case to  Graham
County Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U.S.
409, 162 L. Ed. 2d 390, 125 S. Ct. 2444, see post, at 409, see post at 361, 162
L. Ed. 2d, at 351 (dissenting opinion), but Graham County is distinguishable.
The text of the statute at issue in Graham County is ambiguous, justifying the
Court's partial reliance on ""the 'standard rule that the limitations period
commences when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.'"" See
Graham County, post, at 415-418, and 419, n 2, 162 L. Ed. 2d 390, 125 S. Ct.
2444.  Here, there is no such ambiguity; P 6(3) clearly specifies the date on
which the limitation period begins to run.

III

[***LEdHR1A] [1F] Dodd's § 2255 motion sought to benefit from our holding in
Richardson, supra, which was decided on June 1, 1999.  Thus, he had one year
from that date within which to file his motion.  Because he did not file his
motion until April 4, 2001, the motion was untimely.  We therefore affirm the
judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer

Because the same anomalous factor is present in both this case and in [**2484]
Graham County Soil  & Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson,
545 U.S. 409, 162 L. Ed. 2d 390, 125 S. Ct. 2444, and is decisive in my analysis
of both cases, it is appropriate to explain  [*361]  my views in a single
opinion.  In each case the most natural reading of the statutory text would make
it possible for the limitations period to expire before the cause of action
accrues. Whether the source of this possible result is merely the use of
careless wording or an incorrect assumption by Congress concerning the timing of
two relevant events, I am convinced that Congress did not intend to authorize
such a perverse result in either case.  Thus, while I agree with much of the
reasoning in the Court's cogent opinion in Graham County, I write separately
because I would agree with the Court of Appeals' reading of the text of 31
U.S.C. § 3731(b)(1) were it not for this anomaly. In this case, however, because
that same factor provides an even stronger reason for rejecting the
interpretation of 28 U.S.C. § 2255, P 6(3), that the Court  [***352]  endorses,
I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

I

In Graham County, the relator and the Government argue (and the Court of Appeals
held) that the 6-year limitations period applicable to a ""civil action under
section 3730,"" 31 U.S.C. § 3731(b)(1), applies to the retaliation action
authorized by § 3730(h).  That argument is supported by a literal reading of the
statutory text; for § 3730(h) plainly qualifies as a ""civil action under section
3730."" Moreover, that reading derives strong support from the interest in having
a uniform federal statute of limitations govern the litigation of federal causes
of action.  Cf. Jones v. R. R. Donnelley & Sons Co., 541 U.S. 369, 377-383, 158
L. Ed. 2d 645, 124 S. Ct. 1836 (2004).  Nevertheless, I agree with the Court
that another reading of the text is far more plausible, and with its conclusion
that when choosing between two constructions of a statute of limitations,
whenever possible we should prefer the construction that starts the time limit
running when the cause of action accrues. 1

1 Contrary to the Court's comment in Graham County, post, at 419, n 2, 162 L.
Ed. 2d 390, 125 S. Ct. 2444, I do not suggest that a statute providing that the
limitations period begins to run before the cause of action accrues is
necessarily ambiguous. Rather, as Justice Thomas' scholarly footnote
demonstrates, Graham County, post, at 419-421, n 3, 162 L. Ed. 2d 390, 125 S.
Ct. 2444, it is so unlikely that a legislature would actually intend such an
anomalous design that I would presume that the anomaly was the product of a
drafting error absent evidence in either the legislative history or elsewhere in
the text that Congress specifically intended such a result.  See Koons Buick
Pontiac GMC, Inc. v. Nigh, 543 U.S. 50, 65-66, 160 L. Ed. 2d 389, 125 S. Ct. 460
(2004) (Stevens, J., concurring). The literal text of § 3731(b)(1), which uses
an event that is not an element of the retaliation cause of action to start the
limitations period running, produces two anomalies: (1) The statute may never
begin to run, and (2) it may expire before the cause of action accrues. The
Court argues that the first anomaly makes the statute ambiguous and that the
second justifies resort to a default rule to resolve the ambiguity.  In my
judgment, the latter anomaly would provide a sufficient justification for resort
to the default rule whether or not some other feature of the statute would
support an argument that the text was ""ambiguous.""
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 [*362]   In Graham County that choice is compelled by the interaction between
two relevant events: the ""violation of § 3729"" and the retaliatory act against
the whistle-blower.  Section 3731(b)(1) provides that a ""civil action under
section 3730"" must be brought within six years of a ""violation of section 3729.""
If this section were read to  [**2485] encompass retaliation claims under §
3730(h), as held by the Court of Appeals, the statute of limitations would be
triggered by the ""violation of section 3729""; that is, the limitations period
would begin to run before the cause of action for retaliation accrues, and could
potentially expire before an actionable retaliation claim even exists.  See
Graham County, post, at 421-422, 162 L. Ed. 2d 390, 125 S. Ct. 2444; United
States ex rel. Wilson v. Graham County Soil & Water Conservation Dist., 367 F.3d
245, 260-261 (CA4 2004) (Wilkinson, J., dissenting).  Thus, the potentially
prolonged time period between the two relevant events--the violation of § 3729
(triggering the limitations period) and the retaliation against the
whistle-blower (giving rise to an actionable claim)--could leave the
well-intentioned whistle-blower without any recourse under § 3730(h), the very
statute designed to provide such protection.

[*363]  The Court rightly avoids that  [***353]  harsh and counterintuitive
result by adopting a construction of the statute that would generally start the
running of the limitations period from the date the cause of action accrues,
i.e., when the act or acts of retaliation occur.  As Justice Thomas explains,
that is not only the prevailing rule applied throughout the country to analogous
state-law claims, Graham County, post, at 419-421, n. 2, 162 L. Ed. 2d 390, 125
S. Ct. 2444; it is also the background norm against which Congress legislates,
Graham County, post, at 418-419, 162 L. Ed. 2d 390, 125 S. Ct. 2444. Because
Congress surely did not intend to create a cause of action for retaliation with
one hand, and impose with the other a premature trigger date for the limitations
period with the potential to bar retaliation claims altogether, I concur in the
judgment in Graham County.

II

The same potential for premature expiration of a statute of limitations is the
primary reason why I cannot join the Court's anomalous construction of the
statute in this case.  The statute we are called upon to interpret provides a
1-year period of limitation for a habeas petition that has as its basis a new
rule of criminal law or criminal procedure that has retroactive application.
Title 28 U.S.C. § 2255, P 6(3), provides that the ""limitation period shall run
from . . . the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the
Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and
made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review."" There are two
possible interpretations of when the period should start to run: from the date
that this Court recognizes the new right, or from the date that both conditions
2 in P 6(3) are met.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - Footnotes - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

2 Section 2255, P 6(3), technically has three requirements: that a right be
""initially recognized,"" that it be ""newly recognized,"" and that it be ""made
retroactively applicable."" In practice, however, the first two requirements are
one and the same.  Hence, in this opinion I will refer only to the requirements
(1) that a right be newly recognized and (2) that it be made retroactively
applicable.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 [*364]  If, as I believe Congress thought to be the case, this Court made a
decision concerning a new rule's retroactive application at the same time it
recognized the new right, the statutory scheme would make perfect sense:
Petitioners, whether filing an initial habeas petition or a second or successive
petition, would have one year from this Court's decision to file a petition for
a writ taking advantage of that decision.  Within a relatively short amount of
time, those claims would be adjudicated, and the statute's goals of finality
would be duly [**2486]  served.  In practice, however, this Court does not
ordinarily make retroactivity judgments at the time a new right is recognized. 3
See, e.g.,  Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, 153 L. Ed. 2d 556, 122 S. Ct. 2428
(2002) (applying Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435, 120 S.
Ct. 2348 (2000), to determinations of death penalty eligibility); Schriro v.
Summerlin, 542 U.S. 348, 542 U.S. 348, 159 L. Ed. 2d 442, 124 S. Ct. 2519 (2004)
(concluding Ring was not retroactive).  Thus, as in Graham County,  [***354]
the statute implicates two relevant events: this Court's recognition of a new
right (which, according to the majority, triggers the limitations period) and
the declaration that the right can be applied retroactively (which allows a
petitioner to proceed with the claim).  Because a significant amount of time may
elapse during the interval between the triggering event and the point at which a
petitioner may actually be able to file an action seeking relief under the
statute, there is a real risk that the 1-year limitations period will expire
before the cause of action accrues. In my judgment, the probable explanation for
statutory text that creates this risk is Congress' apparent assumption that our
recognition of the new right and our decision to apply it retroactively would be
made at the same time.  Otherwise it seems nonsensical to assume that Congress
deliberately enacted a statute that recognizes a cause of action, but wrote the
limitations period in a way that  [*365]  precludes an individual from ever
taking advantage of the cause of action.

3 The retroactivity issue is not normally argued in the same case that announces
a new rule because the prisoner is only interested in the outcome of his own
case.  Moreover, in order to minimize the impact of the new rule at issue, he
actually has an incentive to minimize its consequences.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 We are thus faced with the same decision as in Graham County: Do we interpret
the statute in such a way as to allow prisoners such as Dodd to take advantage
of the full year Congress provided for such claims, or do we interpret the
statute in such a way that the limitations period will begin to run before a
prisoner may take advantage of P 6(3)?  As an initial matter, the text here
certainly permits both readings, just as it did in Graham County. Paragraph 6(3)
requires that two prerequisites must be met before a habeas petitioner can take
advantage of that date as the starting point for the statute of limitations.
Both requirements are in the past tense, and both must be satisfied before P
6(3) is applicable.  Furthermore, just as the clause ""if that right has been
newly recognized by the Supreme Court"" describes the date indicated in the
phrase ""the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized,"" it is
possible to read the subordinate clause ""if that right has been . . . made
retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review"" as amplifying the
description of the date in the provision's main clause, rather than adding an
additional qualifier.  Consequently, while the majority's reading of P
6(3)--requiring that the statute of limitations begin to run when this Court
recognizes a new rule--may be the more natural reading of the text, that
advocated by petitioner--starting the statute of limitations when the new rule
is held to be retroactive--is by no means implausible. 4

4 I should note an additional point of disagreement with the majority (and with
petitioner).  In reaching its result, the Court relies on an assumption made by
both parties and not challenged in this Court: namely, that the decision to make
a new rule retroactive for purposes of this section can be made by any lower
court.  While I recognize that every Circuit to have addressed the issue has
made the same assumption, I am satisfied that the Government's initial
interpretation of this provision is the correct one.  See Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae in Tyler v. Cain, O. T. 2000, No. 00-5961, p 16, n 7.
Under that interpretation, the requirement that the ""right has been newly
recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on
collateral review"" is met only if the Supreme Court has made the right
retroactive. Courts that have reached the contrary conclusion have principally
relied on the fact that 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(2)(A) contains an explicit
requirement that a new rule be ""made retroactive . . . by the Supreme Court.""
(Emphasis added.) See Ashley v. United States, 266 F.3d 671, 674 (CA7 2001).
Thus, the argument goes, the absence of ""by the Supreme Court"" after ""made
retroactive"" must have some meaning.  However, in that clause there is only one
verb that the prepositional phrase ""by the Supreme Court"" can modify, whereas in
the relevant clause of § 2255, P 6(3), there are two: newly recognized and made
retroactive. The more natural reading of P 6(3) is that the prepositional phrase
""by the Supreme Court"" modifies both verbs of the subordinate clause.  This
reading comports with Congress' general direction that this Court, and not the
lower courts, should provide the final answer to questions of interpretation
arising under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).
See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) (requiring that a state-court decision be
contrary to ""clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court
of the United States"" (emphasis added)).  Additionally, it avoids difficult
questions of which court can make a retroactivity determination, sets a uniform
date by which lower courts can make determinations as to whether a petition is
timely, and means that only those cases made retroactive by this Court can form
the basis for a petition that can gain the benefit of tolling under § 2255, P
6(3).  Finally, it is the only interpretation that gives full effect to § 2255,
P 8(2), which allows prisoners who have already completed one round of federal
habeas review to seek additional relief on the basis of such a new rule.
Ultimately, this reading has no direct bearing on the question presented in this
case.  While my view that this Court must make the retroactivity determination
informs my belief that Congress had a mistaken understanding of how P 6(3) would
operate in practice, I would conclude that the 1-year limitations period begins
to run when both requirements of P 6(3) are met regardless of which court makes
the retroactivity decision. Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer
do not join this footnote.

 [*366]  [***355]  [**2487]     Moreover, the potential for claims to be
prematurely barred by the statute of limitations is even greater than in Graham
County. There, the possibility that the 6-year statute of limitations period
could run before the cause of action accrued, while plausible, was not
particularly likely, since in  [*367]  most cases the retaliatory conduct that
would form the basis of the cause of action under 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h) would
probably occur within six years of the violation of § 3729. 5 In this case,
owing to the substantially shorter 1-year statute of limitations period, both
requirements of 28 U.S.C. § 2255, P 6(3), will often not be met before the
statute of limitations period has expired if it is triggered by the decision of
the Supreme Court announcing a new rule.

 The restraining order had been issued by a state trial court several weeks
earlier in conjunction with respondent's divorce proceedings.  The original form
order, issued on May 21, 1999, and served on respondent's husband on June 4,
1999, commanded him not to ""molest or disturb the [**2801]  peace of
[respondent] or of any child,"" and to remain at least 100 yards from the family
home at all times.  366 F.3d 1093, 1143 (CA10 2004) (en banc) (appendix to
dissenting opinion of O'Brien, J.).  The bottom of the preprinted form noted
that the reverse side contained ""IMPORTANT NOTICES FOR RESTRAINED PARTIES AND
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS."" Ibid. (emphasis deleted).  The preprinted  [*752]
text on the back of the form included the following ""WARNING"":


     ""A KNOWING VIOLATION OF A RESTRAINING ORDER IS A CRIME . . . .  A
     VIOLATION WILL ALSO CONSTITUTE CONTEMPT OF COURT.  YOU MAY BE ARRESTED
     WITHOUT NOTICE IF A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER HAS PROBABLE CAUSE TO
     BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE KNOWINGLY VIOLATED THIS ORDER."" Id., at 1144.



The preprinted text on the back of the form also included a ""NOTICE TO LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS,"" which read in part:


     ""YOU SHALL USE EVERY REASONABLE MEANS TO ENFORCE THIS RESTRAINING

     THIS ORDER."" Ibid. (same).



On June 4, 1999, the state trial court modified the terms of the restraining
order and made it permanent.  The modified order gave respondent's husband the
right to spend time with his three daughters (ages 10, 9, and 7) on alternate
weekends, for two weeks during the summer, and, ""'upon reasonable notice,'"" for
a midweek dinner visit ""'arranged by the parties'""; the modified order also
allowed him to visit  [*753]  the home to collect the children for such
""parenting time."" Id., at 1097 (majority opinion).

According to the complaint, at about 5 or 5:30 pm. on Tuesday, June 22, 1999,
respondent's husband took the three daughters while they were playing outside
the family  [***667]  home.  No advance arrangements had been made for him to
see the daughters that evening.  When respondent noticed the children were
missing, she suspected her husband had taken them.  At about 7:30 pm., she
called the Castle Rock Police Department, which dispatched two officers.  The
complaint continues: ""When [the officers] arrived . . ., she showed them a copy
of the TRO and requested that it be enforced and the three children be returned
to her immediately.  [The officers] stated that there was nothing they could do
about the TRO and suggested that [respondent] call the Police Department again
if the three children did not return home by 10:00 pm."" App. to Pet. for Cert.

At approximately 8:30 pm., respondent talked to her husband on his cellular
telephone.  He told her ""he had the three children [at an] amusement park in
Denver."" Ibid. She called the police again and [**2802]  asked them to ""have
someone check for"" her husband or his vehicle at the amusement park and ""put out
an [all points bulletin]"" for her husband, but the officer with whom she spoke
""refused to do so,"" again telling her to ""wait until 10:00 pm. and see if"" her
husband returned the girls.  Id., at 126a-127a.

At approximately 10:10 pm., respondent called the police and said her children
were still missing, but she was now told to wait until midnight.  She called at
midnight and told the dispatcher her children were still missing.  She went to
her husband's apartment and, finding nobody there, called the police at 12:10
a.m.; she was told to wait for an officer to arrive.  When none came, she went
to the police station at  [*754]  12:50 a.m. and submitted an incident report.
The officer who took the report ""made no reasonable effort to enforce the TRO or
locate the three children.  Instead, he went to dinner."" Id., at 127a.

At approximately 3:20 a.m., respondent's husband arrived at the police station
and opened fire with a semiautomatic handgun he had purchased earlier that
evening.  Police shot back, killing him.  Inside the cab of his pickup truck,
they found the bodies of all three daughters, whom he had already murdered.

On the basis of the foregoing factual allegations, respondent brought an action
under Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming that the town violated the
Due Process Clause because its police department had ""an official policy or
custom of failing to respond properly to complaints of restraining order
violations"" and ""tolerate[d] the non-enforcement of restraining orders by its
police officers."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 129a. 3 The complaint also alleged that
the town's actions ""were taken either willfully, recklessly or with such gross
negligence as to indicate wanton disregard and deliberate indifference to""
respondent's civil rights.  Ibid.

 Before answering the complaint,  [***668]  the defendants filed a motion to
dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  The District Court
granted the motion, concluding that, whether construed as making a substantive
due process or procedural due process claim, respondent's complaint failed to
state a claim upon which relief could be granted.

A panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the rejection of a substantive due
process claim, but found that respondent had alleged a cognizable procedural due
process claim.  307 F.3d 1258 (CA10 2002).  On rehearing en banc, a divided
[*755]  court reached the same disposition, concluding that respondent had a
""protected property interest in the enforcement of the terms of her restraining
order"" and that the town had deprived her of due process because ""the police
never 'heard' nor seriously entertained her request to enforce and protect her
interests in the restraining order."" 366 F.3d at 1101, 1117.  We granted

[HN1] The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that a
State shall not ""deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due
process of law.""  Amdt.  14, § 1.  In 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Congress has created a
federal cause of action for ""the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or
immunities secured by the [**2803]  Constitution and laws."" Respondent claims
the benefit of this provision on the ground that she had a property interest in
police enforcement of the restraining order against her husband; and that the
town deprived her of this property without due process by having a policy that
tolerated nonenforcement of restraining orders.

As the Court of Appeals recognized, we left a similar question unanswered in
DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep't of Social Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 103 L. Ed. 2d
249, 109 S. Ct. 998 (1989), another case with ""undeniably tragic"" facts: Local
child-protection officials had failed to protect a young boy from beatings by
his father that left him severely brain damaged.  Id., at 191-193, 103 L. Ed. 2d
249, 109 S. Ct. 998.  We held that  [HN2] the so-called ""substantive"" component
of the Due Process Clause does not ""requir[e] the State to protect the life,
liberty, and property of its citizens against invasion by private actors."" Id.,
at 195, 103 L. Ed. 2d 249, 109 S. Ct. 998.  We noted, however, that the
petitioner had not properly preserved the argument that--and we thus ""decline[d]
to consider"" whether--state ""child protection statutes gave [him] an
'entitlement' to receive protective services in accordance with the terms of the
statute, an entitlement which would enjoy due process protection."" Id., at 195,
n. 2, 103 L. Ed. 2d 249, 109 S. Ct. 998.

[*756]  [HN3]  [***LEdHR4] [4]  [***LEdHR5] [5] The procedural component of the
Due Process Clause does not protect everything that might be described as a
""benefit"": ""To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have
more than an abstract need or desire"" and ""more than a unilateral expectation of
it.  He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it."" Board of
Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548, 92 S.
Ct. 2701 (1972).  Such entitlements are, ""'of course, . . . not created by the
Constitution.  Rather, they are created and their dimensions are  [***669]
defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source
such as state law.'"" Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 709, 47 L. Ed. 2d 405, 96 S.
Ct. 1155 (1976) (quoting Roth, supra, at 577, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548, 92 S. Ct. 2701);
see also Phillips v. Washington Legal Foundation, 524 U.S. 156, 164, 141 L. Ed.
2d 174, 118 S. Ct. 1925 (1998).

A

[***LEdHR1A]  Our cases recognize that  [HN4] a benefit is not a protected
entitlement if government officials may grant or deny it in their discretion.
See, e.g., Kentucky Dep't of Corrections v. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 462-463, 104
L. Ed. 2d 506, 109 S. Ct. 1904 (1989).  The Court of Appeals in this case
determined that Colorado law created an entitlement to enforcement of the
restraining order because the ""court-issued restraining order . . . specifically
dictated that its terms must be enforced"" and a ""state statute command[ed]""
enforcement of the order when certain objective conditions were met (probable
cause to believe that the order had been violated and that the object of the
order had received notice of its existence).  366 F.3d at 1101, n. 5; see also
id., at 1100, n. 4; id., at 1104-1105, and n 9.  Respondent contends that we are
obliged ""to give deference to the Tenth Circuit's analysis of Colorado law on""
whether she had an entitlement to enforcement of the restraining order. Tr. of
Oral Arg. 52.

[***LEdHR6] [6] We will not, of course, defer to the Tenth Circuit on the
ultimate issue: whether what Colorado law has given respondent constitutes a
property interest for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.   [HN5] That
determination, despite its  [*757] state-law underpinnings, is ultimately one of
federal constitutional law.  ""Although the underlying substantive interest is
created by 'an independent source such as state law,' federal constitutional law
[**2804] determines whether that interest rises to the level of a 'legitimate
claim of entitlement' protected by the Due Process Clause."" Memphis Light, Gas &
Water Div. v. Craft, 436 U.S. 1, 9, 56 L. Ed. 2d 30, 98 S. Ct. 1554 (1978)
(emphasis added) (quoting Roth, supra, at 577, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548, 92 S. Ct. 2701
); cf. United States ex rel. TVA v. Powelson, 319 U.S. 266, 279, 87 L. Ed. 1390,
63 S. Ct. 1047 (1943).  Resolution of the federal issue begins, however, with a
determination of what it is that state law provides.  In the context of the
present case, the central state-law question is whether Colorado law gave
respondent a right to police enforcement of the restraining order. It is on this
point that respondent's call for deference to the Tenth Circuit is relevant.

We have said that  [HN6] a ""presumption of deference [is] given the views of a
federal court as to the law of a State within its jurisdiction."" Phillips,
supra, at 167, 141 L. Ed. 2d 174, 118 S. Ct. 1925.  That presumption can be
overcome, however, see Leavitt v. Jane L., 518 U.S. 137, 145, 135 L. Ed. 2d 443,
116 S. Ct. 2068 (1996) (per curiam), and we think deference inappropriate here.
The Tenth Circuit's opinion, which reversed the Colorado District Judge, did not
draw upon a deep well of state-specific expertise, but consisted primarily of
quoting language from the restraining order, the statutory text, and a
state-legislative-hearing transcript.  See 366 F.3d at 1103-1109.  These texts,
moreover, say nothing distinctive to Colorado, but use mandatory language that
(as we shall  [***670]  discuss) appears in many state and federal statutes.  As
for case law: The only state-law cases about restraining orders that the Court
of Appeals relied upon were decisions of Federal District Courts in Ohio and
Pennsylvania and state courts in New Jersey, Oregon, and Tennessee.  Id., at
1104-1105, n. 9, 1109. 4 Moreover, if we were simply to accept  [*758]  the
Court of Appeals' conclusion, we would necessarily have to decide conclusively a
federal constitutional question (i.e., whether such an entitlement constituted
property under the Due Process Clause and, if so, whether petitioner's customs
or policies provided too little process to protect it).  We proceed, then, to
our own analysis of whether Colorado law gave respondent a right to enforcement
of the restraining order. 5

4 Most of the Colorado-law cases cited by the Court of Appeals appeared in
footnotes declaring them to be irrelevant because they involved only substantive
due process (366 F.3d at 1100-1101, nn 4-5), only statutes without restraining
orders (id., at 1101, n. 5), or Colorado's Government Immunity Act, which the
Court of Appeals concluded applies ""only to . . . state tort law claims"" (id.,
at 1108-1109, n. 12).  Our analysis is likewise unaffected by the Immunity Act
or by the way that Colorado has dealt with substantive due process or cases that
do not involve restraining orders.

5 In something of an anyone-but-us approach, the dissent simultaneously (and
thus unpersuasively) contends not only that this Court should certify a question
to the Colorado Supreme Court, post, at 776-778, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 682-683
(opinion of Stevens, J.), but also that it should defer to the Tenth Circuit
(which itself did not certify any such question), post, at 775-776, 162 L. Ed.
2d, at 680-681.  No party in this case has requested certification, even as an
alternative disposition.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 56 (petitioner's counsel
""disfavor[ing]"" certification); id., at 25-26 (counsel for the United States
arguing against certification).  At oral argument, in fact, respondent's counsel
declined Justice Stevens' invitation to request it.  Id., at 53.

 B

[***LEdHR7A]  The critical language in the restraining order came not from any
part of the order itself (which was signed by the state-court trial judge and
directed to the restrained party, respondent's husband), but from the preprinted
notice to law-enforcement personnel that appeared on [**2805]  the back of the
order.  See supra, at 751-752, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 666.  That notice effectively
restated the statutory provision describing ""peace officers' duties"" related to
the crime of violation of a restraining order. At the time of the conduct at
issue in this case, that provision read as follows:


      [HN7] ""(a) Whenever a restraining order is issued, the protected
     person shall be provided with a copy of such  [*759]  order.  A peace
     officer shall use every reasonable means to enforce a restraining
     order.

     ""(b) A peace officer shall arrest, or, if an arrest would be
     impractical under the circumstances, seek a warrant for the arrest of
     a restrained person when the peace officer has information amounting
     to probable cause that:

     ""(I) The restrained person has violated or attempted to violate any
     provision of a restraining order; and

     ""(II) The restrained person has been properly served with a copy of
     the restraining order or the restrained person has received actual
     notice of the existence and substance of such order.

     ""(c) In making the probable cause determination described in  [***671]
     paragraph (b) of this subsection (3), a peace officer shall assume
     that the information received from the registry is accurate.  A peace
     officer shall enforce a valid restraining order whether or not there
     is a record of the restraining order in the registry."" Colo. Rev.
     Stat. § 18-6-803.5(3) (Lexis 1999) (emphases added).



The Court of Appeals concluded that this statutory provision--especially taken
in conjunction with a statement from its legislative history, 6 and with another
statute restricting  [*760]  criminal and civil liability for officers making
arrests 7--established the Colorado Legislature's clear intent ""to alter the
fact that the police were not enforcing domestic abuse restraining orders,"" and
thus its intent ""that the recipient of a domestic abuse restraining order have
an entitlement to its enforcement."" 366 F.3d at 1108.  Any other result, it
said, ""would render domestic abuse restraining orders utterly valueless."" Id.,
at 1109.

6 The Court of Appeals quoted one lawmaker's description of how the bill ""'would
really attack the domestic violence problems'"": ""'[T]he entire criminal justice
system must act in a consistent manner, which does not now occur.  The police
must make probable cause arrests. The prosecutors must prosecute every case.
Judges must apply appropriate sentences, and probation officers must monitor
their probationers closely.  And the offender needs to be sentenced to
offender-specific therapy. ""'[T]he entire system must send the same message . .
. [that] violence is criminal.  And so we hope that House Bill 1253 starts us
down this road.'"" 366 F.3d at 1107 (quoting Tr. of Colorado House Judiciary
Hearings on House Bill 1253, Feb. 15, 1994) (emphasis deleted).

7  [HN8] Under Colo. Rev. Stat. § 18-6-803.5(5) (Lexis 1999), ""[a] peace officer
arresting a person for violating a restraining order or otherwise enforcing a
restraining order"" was not to be held civilly or criminally liable unless he
acted ""in bad faith and with malice"" or violated ""rules adopted by the Colorado
supreme court.""

This last statement is sheer hyperbole.  Whether or not respondent had a right
to enforce the restraining order, it rendered certain otherwise lawful conduct
by her husband both criminal and in contempt of court.  See §§ 18-6-803.5(2)(a),
(7).  The creation of grounds on which he could be arrested, criminally
prosecuted, and held in contempt was hardly ""valueless""--even if the prospect of
those sanctions ultimately failed to prevent him from committing three murders
and a suicide.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR7A]  We do not believe that  [HN9] these provisions of
Colorado law truly made enforcement of restraining orders mandatory. A well
established tradition of police discretion has [**2806]  long coexisted with
apparently mandatory arrest statutes.


      [HN10] ""In each and every state there are long-standing statutes
     that,  by their terms, seem to preclude nonenforcement by the police.
     . . .  However, for a number of reasons, including their legislative
     history, insufficient resources, and sheer physical impossibility, it
     has been recognized that such statutes cannot be interpreted
     literally.  . . .  [T]hey clearly do not mean that a police officer
     may not lawfully decline to make an arrest. As to third parties in
     these states, the full-enforcement statutes simply have no effect, and
     their significance is  [*761]  further diminished."" 1 ABA Standards
     for Criminal Justice 1-4.5, commentary, pp 1-124 to 1-125 (2d ed.
     1980) (footnotes omitted).



The deep-rooted nature of law-enforcement discretion, even in the  [***672]
presence of seemingly mandatory legislative commands, is illustrated by Chicago
v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 144 L. Ed. 2d 67, 119 S. Ct. 1849 (1999), which
involved an ordinance that said a police officer ""'shall order'"" persons to
disperse in certain circumstances, id., at 47, n. 2, 144 L. Ed. 2d 67, 119 S.
Ct. 1849.  This Court rejected out of hand the possibility that ""the mandatory
language of the ordinance . . . afford[ed] the police no discretion."" Id., at
62, n. 32, 144 L. Ed. 2d 67, 119 S. Ct. 1849.  It is, the Court proclaimed,
simply ""common sense that all police officers must use some discretion in
deciding when and where to enforce city ordinances."" Ibid. (emphasis added).

Against that backdrop, a true mandate of police action would require some
stronger indication from the Colorado Legislature than ""shall use every
reasonable means to enforce a restraining order"" (or even ""shall arrest . . . or
. . . seek a warrant""), §§ 18-6-803.5(3)(a), (b).  That language is not
perceptibly more mandatory than the Colorado statute which has long told
municipal chiefs of police that they ""shall pursue and arrest any person fleeing
from justice in any part of the state"" and that they ""shall apprehend any person
in the act of committing any offense . . . and, forthwith and without any
warrant, bring such person before a . . . competent authority for examination
and trial."" Colo. Rev. Stat. § 31-4-112 (Lexis 2004).   [HN11] It is hard to
imagine that a Colorado peace officer would not have some discretion to
determine that--despite probable cause to believe a restraining order has been
violated--the circumstances of the violation or the competing duties of that
officer or his agency counsel decisively against enforcement in a particular
instance.  8  [*762]  The practical necessity for discretion is particularly
apparent in a case such as this one, where the suspected violator is not
actually present and his whereabouts are unknown.  Cf. Donaldson v. Seattle, 65
Wash. App. 661, 671-672, 831 P.2d 1098, 1104 (1992) (""There is a vast difference
between a mandatory duty to arrest [a violator who is on the scene] and a
mandatory duty to conduct a follow up investigation [to locate an absent
violator].  . . .  A mandatory duty to investigate would be completely
open-ended as to priority, duration and intensity"").

8 Respondent in fact concedes that an officer may ""properly"" decide not to
enforce a restraining order when the officer deems ""a technical violation"" too
""immaterial"" to justify arrest. Respondent explains this as a determination that
there is no probable cause. Brief for Respondent 28.  We think, however, that a
determination of no probable cause to believe a violation has occurred is quite
different from a determination that the violation is too insignificant to
pursue.

 The dissent correctly points out that, in the specific context of domestic
violence, mandatory-arrest statutes have been found [**2807]  in some States to
be more mandatory than traditional mandatory-arrest statutes.  Post, at 779-784,
162 L. Ed. 2d, at 683-686 (opinion of Stevens, J.).  The Colorado statute
mandating arrest for a domestic-violence offense is different from but related
to the one at issue here, and it includes similar though not identical phrasing.
See Colo. Rev. Stat. § 18-6-803.6(1) (Lexis 1999) (""When a peace officer
determines that there is probable cause to believe that a crime or offense
involving domestic violence . . . has been  [***673]  committed, the officer
shall, without undue delay, arrest the person suspected of its commission . .
."").  Even in the domestic-violence context, however, it is unclear how the
mandatory-arrest paradigm applies to cases in which the offender is not present
to be arrested. As the dissent explains, post, at 780-781, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at
684-685, and n 8, much of the impetus for mandatory-arrest statutes and policies
derived from the idea that it is better for police officers to arrest the
aggressor in a domestic-violence incident than to attempt to mediate the dispute
or merely to ask the offender to leave the scene. Those other options are only
available, of course, when the offender is present at the  [*763]  scene. See
Hanna, No Right to Choose: Mandated Victim Participation in Domestic Violence
Prosecutions, 109 Harv. L. Rev. 1849, 1860 (1996) (""[T]he clear trend in police
practice is to arrest the batterer at the scene . . ."" (emphasis added)).

As one of the cases cited by the dissent, post, at 783, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 686,
recognized, ""there will be situations when no arrest is possible, such as when
the alleged abuser is not in the home."" Donaldson, 65 Wash. App. , at 674, 831
P. 2d, at 1105 (emphasis added).  That case held that Washington's
mandatory-arrest statute required an arrest only in ""cases where the offender is
on the scene,"" and that it ""d[id] not create an on-going mandatory duty to
conduct an investigation"" to locate the offender. Id., at 675, 831 P. 2d, at
1105.  Colorado's restraining-order statute appears to contemplate a similar
distinction, providing that when arrest is ""impractical""--which was likely the
case when the whereabouts of respondent's husband were unknown--the officers'
statutory duty is to ""seek a warrant"" rather than ""arrest."" § 18-6-803.5(3)(b).

Respondent does not specify the precise means of enforcement that the Colorado
restraining-order statute assertedly mandated--whether her interest lay in
having police arrest her husband, having them seek a warrant for his arrest, or
having them ""use every reasonable means, up to and including arrest, to enforce
the order's terms,"" Brief for Respondent 29-30. 9 Such  [HN12] indeterminacy is
not the hallmark of a duty that is mandatory. Nor can someone be safely deemed
""entitled"" to something when the identity of the alleged entitlement is vague.
See Roth, 408 U.S., at 577, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548, 92 S. Ct. 2701 (considering
[*764]  whether ""certain benefits"" were ""secure[d]"" by rule or understandings);
cf. Natale v. Ridgefield, 170 F.3d 258, 263 (CA2 1999) (""There is no reason . .
. to restrict the 'uncertainty' that will preclude existence of a federally
protectable property interest to the uncertainty that inheres in the exercise of
discretion"").  The dissent, after suggesting various formulations [**2808]  of
[***674]  the entitlement in question, 10 ultimately contends that the
obligations under the statute were quite precise: either make an arrest or (if
that is impractical) seek an arrest warrant, post, at 784, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 687
.  The problem with this is that the seeking of an arrest warrant would be an
entitlement to nothing but procedure--which we have held inadequate even to
support standing, see Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 119 L. Ed.
2d 351, 112 S. Ct. 2130 (1992); much less can it be the basis for a property
interest. See post, at 771-772, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 678 (Souter, J., concurring).
After the warrant is sought, it remains within the discretion of a judge whether
to grant it, and after"

[***LEdHR1A] [1A]  [HN1] When an alien is found ineligible to remain in the
United States, the process for selecting the country to which he will be removed

a country without the explicit, advance consent of that country's government.

Petitioner Keyse Jama was born in Somalia and remains a citizen of that nation.
He was admitted to the United States as a refugee, but his refugee status was
terminated in 2000 by reason of a criminal conviction.  See  Jama v. INS, 329
F.3d 630, 631 (CA8 2003).  The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)
brought an action to remove petitioner from the United States for having
committed a crime involving moral turpitude.  Ibid.; see 8 U.S.C. §§
1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), 1229a(e)(2)(A) [8 U.S.C.S. §§ 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I),
1229a(e)(2)(A)].  In the administrative hearing,  petitioner conceded that he
was subject to removal, although he sought [**698]  various forms of relief from
that determination (adjustment of status, withholding of removal, and asylum
relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel,
Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment).  He declined to designate a
country to which he preferred to be removed.  The Immigration Judge ordered
petitioner removed to Somalia, his country of birth  [*338]  and citizenship.
The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed that determination, and petitioner did
not seek review in the Court of Appeals.

Instead, petitioner instituted collateral proceedings under the habeas statute,
28 U.S.C. § 2241 [28 U.S.C.S. § 2241], to challenge the designation of Somalia
as his destination. He filed his petition in the United States District Court
for the District of Minnesota, alleging that Somalia has no functioning
government, that Somalia therefore could not consent in advance to his removal,
and that the Government was barred from removing him to Somalia absent such
advance consent.  The District Court agreed that petitioner could not be removed
to a country that had not consented in advance to receive him,  Jama v INS, 2002

Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that § 1231(b)(2) does not require acceptance
by the destination country.   329 F.3d at 633-635.  We granted certiorari.   540

1 On March 1, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security and its Bureau of Border

(2000 ed., Supp. II) [6 U.S.C.S. §§ 251(2), 252(a)].  Accordingly, the
discretion formerly vested in the Attorney General is now vested in the
Secretary of Homeland Security.  See § 551(d)(2).  Because petitioner's removal
proceedings, including the designation of Somalia as the country of removal,
occurred before this transfer of functions, we continue to refer to the Attorney
General as the relevant decisionmaker.

 [HN3] The statute thus provides four consecutive removal commands:  (1) An
alien shall be removed to the country of his choice (subparagraphs (A) to (C)),
unless one of the conditions eliminating that command is satisfied; (2)
otherwise he shall be removed to the country of which he is a citizen (
subparagraph (D)), unless one of the conditions eliminating that command is
[**700]  satisfied; (3) otherwise he shall be removed to one of the countries
with which he has a lesser connection (clauses (i) to (vi) of subparagraph (E));
or (4) if that is ""impracticable, inadvisable or impossible,"" he shall be
removed to ""another country whose government will accept the alien into that
country"" (clause (vii) of subparagraph (E)).

Petitioner declined to designate a country of choice, so the first step was
inapplicable.  Petitioner is a citizen of Somalia, which has not informed the
Attorney General of its willingness to receive him (clause (i) of subparagraph
(D)), so the Attorney General was not obliged to remove petitioner to Somalia
under the second step.  The question is whether the Attorney General was
precluded from removing petitioner to Somalia under the third step (clause (iv)
of subparagraph (E)) because Somalia had not given its consent.

A

[***LEdHR1A] [1B]  [***LEdHR2] [2]  [HN4] We do not lightly assume that Congress
has omitted from its adopted text requirements that it nonetheless intends to
apply, and our reluctance is even greater when Congress has shown elsewhere in
the same statute that it knows how to make such a requirement manifest. In all
of subparagraph (E), an acceptance requirement appears only in the terminal
clause (vii), a clause that the Attorney General may invoke only after he finds
that the removal options presented in the  [*342]  other six are ""impracticable,
inadvisable, or impossible."" Clauses (i) through (vi) come first--in the statute
and in the process of selecting a country.  And those six clauses contain not a
word about acceptance by the destination country; they merely direct that ""the
Attorney General  [***716]  shall remove the alien"" to any one of them.

[***LEdHR3] [3] Effects are attached to nonacceptance throughout the rest of
paragraph (2), making the failure to specify any such effect in most of
subparagraph (E) conspicuous--and more likely intentional.  Subparagraph (C)
prescribes the consequence of nonacceptance in the first step of the selection
process; subparagraph (D) does the same for the second step; and clause (vii) of
subparagraph (E) does the same for the fourth step. 2 With respect to the third
step, however, the Attorney General is directed to move on to the fourth step
only if it is ""impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible to remove the alien to
each country described in"" the third step.  Nonacceptance may surely be one of
the factors considered in determining whether removal to a given country is
impracticable or inadvisable, but the statute does not give it the dispositive
effect petitioner wishes.

2 The dissent contends that there are only three steps, with all of subparagraph
(E) constituting only a single step, and that clause (vii)'s acceptance
requirement therefore covers the entire subparagraph.   Post, at 353, n. 2, 160
L. Ed. 2d, at 722-723, 125 S. Ct. 694, 543 U.S. 335 (opinion of Souter, J.).  We
think not.  Clause (vii) applies only after the options set out in the third
step are exhausted; it is nothing if not a discrete, further step in the
process.  That step four is a separate clause rather than a separate
subparagraph is immaterial: Step one, which is indisputably set out in three
subparagraphs, belies the dissent's theory that steps must precisely parallel
subparagraphs.

  [***LEdHR1A] [1C] Petitioner seizes upon the word ""another"" in clause (vii) as
a means of importing the acceptance requirement into clauses (i) through (vi).
He argues that if the last resort country is ""another country whose government
will accept the alien,"" then the countries enumerated in clauses (i) through
(vi) must also be ""countries whose governments will accept the alien."" That
stretches the modifier too far.   [*343]  Just last Term, we rejected an
argument much like petitioner's, noting that it ran contrary to ""the grammatical
'rule of [**701] the last antecedent,' according to which  [HN5] a limiting
clause or phrase . . . should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or
phrase that it immediately follows.""  Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 26, 157
L. Ed. 2d 333, 124 S. Ct. 376 (2003).  There, a statute referred first to a
claimant's ""previous work"" and then to ""any other kind of substantial gainful
work which exists in the national economy""; under the rule of the last
antecedent, we declined to read the limiting clause ""which exists in the
national economy"" into the term ""previous work.""  Id., at 26-28, 157 L. Ed. 2d

connecting modifier"" that the dissent here thinks ""another"" to be,  post, at
355, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 724. 3

3 Indeed, both ""other"" and ""another"" are just as likely to be words of
differentiation as they are to be words of connection.  Here the word ""another""
serves simply to rule out the countries already tried at the third step and
referred to in the conditional prologue of clause (vii) (""If impracticable,
inadvisable, or impossible to remove the alien to each country described in a
previous clause of this subparagraph, another country . . ."").  It is the fact
of that close earlier reference that makes it natural to say ""another country""
here, whereas ""[a] country"" is used at the outset of § 1231(b)(1)(C)(iv), in
which the reference to ""each country described in a previous clause of this
subparagraph"" comes later and hence cannot serve as an antecedent for ""another.""
The dissent makes a mountain of this molehill, see  post, at 356-357, 160 L. Ed.
2d, at 725.

The dissent also finds profound meaning in the fact that Congress changed the
text from ""any country"" in the 1996 legislation to ""another country"" in the
current version.  ""The Court cannot be right,"" it says, ""in reducing the 1996
amendment to this level of whimsy.""  Post, at 358, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 726.  But
if one lays the pre-1996 version of the statute beside the current version, he
will find numerous changes that are attributable to nothing more than stylistic
preference.  To take merely one example: Clause (E)(ii) of the current law,
which reads ""The country in which is located the foreign port from which the
alien left for the United States or for a foreign territory contiguous to the
United States,"" previously read ""the country in which is located the foreign
port at which such alien embarked for the United States or for foreign
contiguous territory."" 8 U.S.C. § 1253(a)(2) (1994 ed.) [8 U.S.C.S. § 1253(a)(2)
].  The dissent must explain why these changes were insignificant whereas the
change from ""any country"" to ""another country"" was a momentous limitation upon
executive authority.

  [*344]  Nor does the structure of subparagraph (E) refute the inference
derived  [***717]  from the last antecedent rule.  Each clause is distinct and
ends with a period, strongly suggesting that each may be understood completely
without reading any further. 4 And as we have already noted, it is not necessary
to turn to the acceptance language of clause (vii) to find the conditions under
which the Attorney General is to abandon the third step and move to the fourth,
the last resort option of any willing country.  The Attorney General must do so
if in his judgment it would be ""impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible to
remove the alien to each country described in"" clauses (i) to (vi).  This allows
the Attorney General to take both practical and geopolitical concerns into
account when selecting a destination country (and accords with the similar
flexibility to pass over [**702]  inappropriate countries that the statute gives
the Attorney General at the other steps, see  infra, at 348, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at
719-720).  Petitioner's reading would abridge that exercise of Executive
judgment, effectively deeming the removal of an alien to any country to be per
se ""impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible"" absent that country's advance
acceptance,  even though in many cases--such as this one--it is nothing of the
sort.  (Removing an alien to Somalia apparently involves no more than putting
the alien on one of the regularly  [*345]  scheduled flights from Dubai or
Nairobi, and has been accomplished a number of times since petitioner's removal
proceeding began.  App. 36-40 (declaration of detention enforcement officer Eric
O'Denius).) Even without advance consultation, a country with a functioning
government may well accept a removed alien when he is presented at the border or
a port of entry; the absence of advance consent is hardly synonymous with
impracticability or impossibility. 5

4 By contrast, in the cases on which the dissent relies to rebut the last
antecedent inference, see post, at 354-356, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 723-724, the
structure cut the other way: the modifying clause appeared not in a structurally
discrete statutory provision, but at the end of a single, integrated list--for
example, ""'receives, possesses, or transports in commerce or affecting
commerce.'""  United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 337, 339, 30 L. Ed. 2d 488, 92
S. Ct. 515 (1971); see also  United States v. Standard Brewery, Inc., 251 U.S.
210, 218, 64 L. Ed. 229, 40 S. Ct. 139 (1920);  United States v. United Verde
Copper Co., 196 U.S. 207, 213, 49 L. Ed. 449, 25 S. Ct. 222 (1905).  We do not
dispute that a word is known by its fellows, but here the structure refutes the
premise of fellowship.

5 The Government argued below that even if clauses (i) through (vi) of
subparagraph (E) require some form of consent, the destination country's
acceptance of the alien at the port of entry suffices.  Brief for
Respondent-Appellant in No. 02-2324 (CA8), pp 43-46;  Jama v INS, 2002 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 5731, Civ. File No. 01-1172 (JRT/AJB) (D. Minn., Mar. 31, 2002), p
14, App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a.  Because clauses (i) through (vi) contain no
acceptance requirement, we need not pass on petitioner's contention that when §
1231(b)(2) requires acceptance, only advance acceptance will do.

 [***718]  B

Petitioner contends that even if no acceptance requirement is explicit in the
text, one is manifest in the entire structure of § 1231(b)(2).  The Attorney
General may not remove an alien to a country under subparagraph (A) or (D)
without that country's consent, petitioner reasons, so he must be barred from
circumventing that limitation by removing the same alien to the same country
under subparagraph (E).  The dissent rests its argument only on the existence of
an acceptance requirement in step two (subparagraph (D)) and not in step one (
subparagraphs (A) through (C)). 6

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - Footnotes - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

6 The dissent asserts that we misdescribe petitioner's argument when we say it
rests on both steps one and two.   Post, at 364, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 730, and n.
10.  We note that petitioner heads the relevant argument ""The Plain Language Of
The Statute Requires Acceptance At Every Step,"" Brief for Petitioner 23
(emphasis added), and concludes his description of the country-selection process
with the assertion that ""[t]he outer limit of the Attorney General's authority,
. . . which circumscribes the selection of any country, is that the government
of the country of removal must be willing to accept the alien."" Id., at 18
(emphasis added); see also id., at 19-20.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 [*346]  We note initially a point that applies to both petitioner's and the
dissent's positions: The ""circumvention"" argument requires that the country the
Attorney General selects at step three--here, the country of birth under clause
(iv)--also be the country of citizenship that was disqualified at step two for
failure to accept the alien. That will sometimes be true, yet the reason step
three exists at all is that it will not always be true.  (Indeed, in
petitioner's case, several of the clauses of subparagraph (E) describe Kenya,
not Somalia.) Despite this imperfect overlap, petitioner and the dissent seek to
impose an acceptance requirement on all removals under step three, in the name
of preventing the Attorney General from ""circumventing"" step two in the cases
where a step-three country is also the country of citizenship.

The more fundamental defect in petitioner's argument, which appeals to a
presumed uniformity of acceptance requirement throughout § 1231(b)(2), is that
[**703]  its premise is false.  It is simply not true that the Attorney General
may not remove an alien to a country under subparagraph (A) or (D) without that
country's consent.   [HN6] Subparagraph (C) specifies that the Attorney General
""may disregard"" the alien's subparagraph (A) designation if the designated
country's government proves unwilling to accept the alien or fails to respond
within 30 days.  The word ""may"" customarily connotes discretion.  See, e.g.,
Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 294, n. 26, 69 L. Ed. 2d 640, 101 S. Ct. 2766 (1981)
.  That connotation is particularly apt where, as here, ""may"" is used in
contraposition to the word ""shall"": The Attorney General ""shall remove"" an alien
to the designated country, except that the Attorney General ""may"" disregard the
designation if any one of four potentially countervailing circumstances arises.
And examining those four circumstances reinforces the inappropriateness of
reading ""may"" to mean ""shall"" in subparagraph (C): Would Congress really have
wanted to preclude the Attorney General from removing an alien to his country of
choice, merely because that  [***719]  country took 31 days rather than 30 to
manifest its acceptance?  [*347]  (Subparagraph (C), unlike subparagraph (D),
offers no ""reasonable time"" exception to the 30-day rule.) Petitioner insists
that a lack of advance acceptance is an absolute bar to removal, but offers no
plausible way of squaring that insistence with the text of subparagraph (C). 7

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - Footnotes - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

7 The same incompatibility may exist with regard to subparagraph (D), which
prescribes that the Attorney General ""shall remove the alien"" to his country of
citizenship ""unless"" that country's government declines to accept the alien or
fails to manifest its acceptance within a reasonable time.  The Government urges
that the two exceptions preserve discretion for the Attorney General: If one of
those conditions exists, the Attorney General is no longer required to remove
the alien to that country, but he may still do so.  We need not resolve whether
subparagraph (D) affords this residual level of discretion; subparagraph (C) is
more than enough to demonstrate that an acceptance requirement does not pervade
the selection process in the way petitioner claims, and other factors suffice to
refute the dissent's more limited contention.  Rejection of the Government's
argument is essential, however, to the dissent's position, see post, at 365-368,
160 L. Ed. 2d, at 730-732--and the proper resolution is far from clear.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 Nor does the existence of an acceptance requirement at the fourth and final
step create any structural inference that such a requirement must exist at the
third.  It would be a stretch to conclude that merely because Congress expressly
directed the Attorney General to obtain consent when removing an alien to a
country with which the alien lacks the ties of citizenship, nativity, previous
presence, and so on, Congress must also have implicitly required him to obtain
advance acceptance from countries with which the alien does have such ties.
Moreover, if the Attorney General is unable to secure an alien's removal at the
third step, all that is left is the last-resort provision allowing removal to a
country with which the alien has little or no connection--if a country can be
found that will take him.  If none exists, the alien is left in the same
removable-but-unremovable limbo as the aliens in  Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S.
678, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653, 121 S. Ct. 2491 (2001), and  Clark v Martinez, post, p.
371, 543 U.S. 371, 160 L. Ed. 2d 734, 125 S. Ct. 716, and under the rule
announced in those cases must presumptively be released into American  [*348]
society after six months.  If this is the result that obtains when the
country-selection process fails, there is every reason to refrain from reading
restrictions into that process that do not clearly appear--particularly
restrictions upon the third step, which will often afford the Attorney General
his last realistic option for removal.

[**704]  To infer an absolute rule of acceptance where Congress has not clearly
set it forth would run counter to our customary policy of deference to the
President in matters of foreign affairs.   [HN7] Removal decisions, including
the selection of a removed alien's destination, ""may implicate our relations
with foreign powers"" and require consideration of ""changing political and
economic circumstances.""  Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 81, 48 L. Ed. 2d 478, 96
S. Ct. 1883 (1976).  Congress has already provided a way for the Attorney
General to avoid removals that are likely to ruffle diplomatic feathers, or
simply to prove futile.  At each step in the selection process, he is empowered
to skip over a country that resists accepting the alien, or a country that has
declined to provide assurances that its border guards will allow the alien
entry.

Nor is it necessary to infer an acceptance  [***720]  requirement in order to
ensure that the Attorney General will give appropriate consideration to
conditions in the country of removal.  [HN8] If aliens would face persecution or
other mistreatment in the country designated under § 1231(b)(2), they have a
number of available remedies: asylum, § 1158(b)(1); withholding of removal, §
1231(b)(3)(A); relief under an international agreement prohibiting torture, see
8 CFR §§ 208.16(c)(4), 208.17(a) (2004); and temporary protected status, 8
U.S.C. § 1254a(a)(1) [8 U.S.C.S. § 1254a (a)(1)].  These individualized
determinations strike a better balance between securing the removal of
inadmissible aliens and ensuring their humane treatment than does petitioner's
suggestion that silence from Mogadishu inevitably portends future mistreatment
and justifies declining to remove anyone to Somalia.

[*349]  C

Petitioner points to what he describes as the ""settled construction"" of §
1231(b)(2), and asserts that Congress, in its most recent reenactment of the
provision, should be deemed to have incorporated that construction into law.  We
think not.  Neither of the two requirements for congressional ratification is
met here: Congress did not simply reenact § 1231(b)(2) without change, nor was
the supposed judicial consensus so broad and unquestioned that we must presume
Congress knew of and endorsed it.

Removal is a new procedure created in 1996 through the fusion of two previously
distinct expulsion proceedings, ""deportation"" and ""exclusion."" IIRIRA, §
304(a)(3), 110 Stat 3009-589, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a [8 U.S.C.S. § 1229a]. Our
immigration laws historically distinguished between aliens who have ""entered""
the United States and aliens still seeking to enter (whether or not they are
physically on American soil).  See  Leng May Ma v. Barber, 357 U.S. 185, 187, 2
L. Ed. 2d 1246, 78 S. Ct. 1072 (1958).  ""The distinction was carefully preserved
in Title II"" of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA): expelling an alien
who had already entered required a deportation proceeding, whereas expelling an
alien still seeking admission could be achieved through the more summary
exclusion proceeding.  Ibid.; see  Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 25-27, 74
L. Ed. 2d 21, 103 S. Ct. 321 (1982) (cataloging differences between the two
proceedings).  Aliens who, like petitioner, were allowed into the United States
as refugees were subject to exclusion proceedings rather than deportation
proceedings when their refugee status was revoked.  8 C.F.R. § 207.8 (1995). 8

[***LEdHR5A] [5A]  [***LEdHR6A] [6A] We confront here the problem of a ""mixed""
petition for habeas corpus relief in which a state prisoner presents a federal
court with a single petition containing some claims that have been exhausted in
the state courts and some that have not.  More precisely, we consider whether a
federal district court has discretion to stay the mixed petition to allow the
petitioner to present his unexhausted claims to the state  [*272]  court in the
first instance, and then to return to federal court for review of his perfected
petition.

[**1532]  I

Petitioner Charles Russell Rhines was convicted in South Dakota state court of
first-degree murder and third-degree burglary and sentenced to death.  His
conviction became final on December 2, 1996, when we denied his initial petition
for certiorari.   Rhines v. South Dakota, 519 U.S. 1013, 136 L. Ed. 2d 410, 117
S. Ct. 522.  On December 5, 1996, Rhines filed a petition for state habeas
corpus.  App. 32.  The state court denied his petition, and the Supreme Court of
South Dakota affirmed on February 9, 2000,  Rhines v. Weber, 2000 SD 19, 608
N.W.2d 303. Rhines filed his pro se petition for federal habeas corpus pursuant
to 28 U.S.C. § 2254 [28 U.S.C.S. § 2254] in the United States District Court for
the District of South Dakota on February 22, 2000.  App 3.  Because the 1-year
statute of limitations imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty
Act of 1996 (AEDPA) was tolled while Rhines' state habeas corpus petition was
pending, see 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2) [28 U.S.C.S. § 2244(d)(2)], he still had
more than 11 months left before the expiration of the limitations period.

With the assistance of court-appointed counsel, Rhines filed an amended petition
for writ of habeas corpus and statement of exhaustion on November 20, 2000,
asserting 35 claims of constitutional defects in his conviction and sentence.
App. 39-60.  The State challenged 12 of those claims as unexhausted. Id., at
72-79.  On July 3, 2002, approximately 18 months after Rhines had filed his
amended federal habeas corpus petition, the District Court held that 8 of the 35
claims had not been exhausted. At this time, the AEDPA 1-year statute of
limitations had run.  See  Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 181-182, 150 L. Ed.
2d 251, 121 S. Ct. 2120 (2001) (holding that the statute of limitations is not
tolled during the pendancy of a federal petition).  As a result, if the District
Court had dismissed Rhines' mixed petition at that point, he would  [*273]  have
been unable to refile in federal court after exhausting the unexhausted claims.
[***449]  Rhines therefore moved the District Court to hold his pending habeas
petition in abeyance while he presented his unexhausted claims to the South
Dakota courts.  On July 3, 2002, the District Court granted the motion and
issued a stay ""conditioned upon petitioner commencing state court exhaustion
proceedings within sixty days of this order and returning to this court within
sixty days of completing such exhaustion."" App. 136.  In compliance with that
order, Rhines filed his second state habeas corpus petition on August 22, 2003.

The State appealed the District Court's stay of Rhines' mixed petition to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.  Relying on its decision
in  Akins v. Kenney, 341 F.3d 681, 686 (2003) (holding that ""a district court
has no authority to hold a habeas petition containing unexhausted claims in
abeyance absent truly exceptional circumstances"" (internal quotation marks
omitted)), the Court of Appeals vacated the stay and remanded the case to the
District Court to determine whether Rhines could proceed by deleting unexhausted
claims from his petition.   346 F.3d 799 (2003).  We granted certiorari to
resolve a split in the Circuits regarding the propriety of the District Court's
""stay-and-abeyance"" procedure.  542 U.S. 936, 159 L. Ed. 2d 811, 124 S. Ct. 2905
(2004).  Compare, e.g.,  Crews v. Horn, 360 F.3d 146, 152 (CA3 2004); and
Zarvela v. Artuz, 254 F.3d 374, 381 (CA2 2001), with  346 F.3d 799 (2003) (case
below).

II

[***LEdHR1A] [1B]  [***LEdHR7] [7] Fourteen years before Congress enacted AEDPA,
we held in  Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198
(1982), that federal district courts may not adjudicate mixed petitions [**1533]
for habeas corpus, that is, petitions containing both exhausted and unexhausted
claims.  We reasoned that the interests of comity and federalism dictate that
state courts must have the first opportunity to decide a petitioner's claims.
Id., at 518-519, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198.  We  [*274]  noted that
""[b]ecause 'it would be unseemly in our dual system of government for a federal
district court to upset a state court conviction without an opportunity to the
state courts to correct a constitutional violation,' federal courts apply the
doctrine of comity.""  Id., at 518, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198 (quoting
Darr v. Burford, 339 U.S. 200, 204, 94 L. Ed. 761, 70 S. Ct. 587 (1950)).  That
doctrine ""'teaches that one court should defer action on causes properly within
its jurisdiction until the courts of another sovereignty with concurrent powers,
and already cognizant of the litigation, have had an opportunity to pass upon
the matter.'""  455 U.S., at 518, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198.

[***LEdHR1A] [1C] Accordingly, we imposed a requirement of ""total exhaustion""
and directed federal courts to effectuate that requirement by dismissing mixed
petitions without prejudice and allowing petitioners to return to state court to
present the unexhausted claims to that court in the first instance.  Id., at
522, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198.  When we decided Lundy, there was no
statute of limitations on the filing of federal habeas corpus petitions.  As a
result, petitioners who returned to state court to exhaust their previously
unexhausted claims could come back to federal court to present their perfected
petitions with relative ease.   [***450]  See  Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473,
486, 146 L. Ed. 2d 542, 120 S. Ct. 1595 (2000) (dismissal without prejudice
under Lundy ""contemplated that the prisoner could return to federal court after
the requisite exhaustion"").

[***LEdHR1A] [1D]  [***LEdHR8] [8] The enactment of AEDPA in 1996 dramatically
altered the landscape for federal habeas corpus petitions.  AEDPA preserved
Lundy's total exhaustion requirement, see 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A) [28 U.S.C.S.
§ 2254(b)(1)(A)] (""An application for a writ of habeas corpus . . . shall not be
granted unless it appears that . . . the applicant has exhausted the remedies
available in the courts of the State""), but it also imposed a 1-year statute of
limitations on the filing of federal petitions, § 2244(d).  Although the
limitations period is tolled during the pendency of a ""properly filed
application for State post-conviction or other collateral review,"" § 2244(d)(2),
the filing of a petition for habeas  [*275]  corpus in federal court does not
toll the statute of limitations,  Duncan, 533 U.S. at 181-182, 150 L. Ed. 2d
251, 121 S. Ct. 2120.

[***LEdHR1A] [1E] As a result of the interplay between AEDPA's 1-year statute of
limitations and Lundy's dismissal requirement, petitioners who come to federal
court with ""mixed"" petitions run the risk of forever losing their opportunity
for any federal review of their unexhausted claims.  If a petitioner files a
timely but mixed petition in federal district court, and the district court
dismisses it under Lundy after the limitations period has expired, this will
likely mean the termination of any federal review.  For example, if the District
Court in this case had dismissed the petition because it contained unexhausted
claims, AEDPA's 1-year statute of limitations would have barred Rhines from
returning to federal court after exhausting the previously unexhausted claims in
state court.  Similarly, if a district court dismisses a mixed petition close to
the end of the 1-year period, the petitioner's chances of exhausting his claims
in state court and refiling his petition in federal court before the limitations
period runs are slim.  The problem is not limited to petitioners who file close
to the AEDPA deadline.  Even a petitioner who files early will have no way of
controlling when the district court will resolve the  [**1534]  question of
exhaustion. Thus, whether a petitioner ever receives federal review of his
claims may turn on which district court happens to hear his case.

[***LEdHR1A] [1F]  [***LEdHR2A] [2B]  [***LEdHR3A] [3B]  [***LEdHR4A] [4B]
[***LEdHR5A] [5B]  [***LEdHR6A] [6B] We recognize the gravity of this problem
and the difficulty it has posed for petitioners and federal district courts
alike.  In an attempt to solve the problem, some district courts have adopted a
version of the ""stay-and-abeyance"" procedure employed by the District Court
below.  Under this procedure, rather than dismiss the mixed petition pursuant to
Lundy, a district court might stay the petition and hold it in abeyance while
the petitioner returns to state court to exhaust his previously unexhausted
claims.  Once the petitioner exhausts  [*276]  his state remedies, the district
court will lift the stay and allow the petitioner to proceed in federal court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1G]  [***LEdHR9] [9]   [HN1] District courts do ordinarily have
authority to issue stays, see  Landis v. North American Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254,
81 L. Ed. 153, 57 S. Ct. 163 (1936), where such a stay would be a proper
exercise of discretion, see  Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 706, 137 L. Ed. 2d
945, 117 S. Ct. 1636 (1997).  AEDPA does not deprive district  [***451]  courts
of that authority, cf. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A) [28 U.S.C.S. § 2254(b)(1)(A)]
(""An application for a writ of habeas corpus . . . shall not be granted unless
it appears that . . . the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the
courts of the State"" (emphasis added)), but it does circumscribe their
discretion.  Any solution to this problem must therefore be compatible with
AEDPA's purposes.

[***LEdHR10] [10]  [***LEdHR11] [11] One of the statute's purposes is to ""reduce
delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences, particularly in
capital cases.""  Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U.S. 202, 206, 155 L. Ed. 2d 363, 123
S. Ct. 1398 (2003).  See also  Duncan, 533 U.S., at 179, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251, 121
S. Ct. 2120.  AEDPA's 1-year limitations period ""quite plainly serves the
well-recognized interest in the finality of state court judgments."" Ibid. It
""reduces the potential for delay on the road to finality by restricting the time
that a prospective federal habeas petitioner has in which to seek federal habeas
review."" Ibid.

[***LEdHR12] [12] Moreover, Congress enacted AEDPA against the backdrop of Lundy
's total exhaustion requirement. The tolling provision in § 2244(d)(2) ""balances
the interests served by the exhaustion requirement and the limitation period,""
""by protecting a state prisoner's ability later to apply for federal habeas
relief while state remedies are being pursued.""  Duncan, supra, at 179, 150 L.
Ed. 2d 251, 121 S. Ct. 2120.  AEDPA thus encourages petitioners to seek relief
from state courts in the first instance by tolling the 1-year limitations period
while a ""properly filed application for State post-conviction or other
collateral review"" is pending.  28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2) [28 U.S.C.S. §
2244(d)(2)].  This scheme reinforces the importance of Lundy's ""simple and clear
instruction to potential litigants: before you bring any claims to federal
court,  [*277]  be sure that you first have taken each one to state court.""  455
U.S., at 520, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198.

[***LEdHR1A] [1H] Stay and abeyance, if employed too frequently, has the
potential to undermine these twin purposes.  Staying a federal habeas petition
frustrates AEDPA's objective of encouraging finality by allowing a petitioner to
delay the resolution of the federal proceedings.  It also undermines AEDPA's
goal of streamlining federal habeas proceedings by decreasing a petitioner's
incentive to exhaust all his claims in state court prior to filing his federal
petition.  Cf.  Duncan, supra, 533 U.S., at 180, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251, 121 S. Ct.
2120 (""[D]iminution of statutory incentives to proceed first in state court
would . . . increase the risk of the very piecemeal [**1535]  litigation that
the exhaustion requirement is designed to reduce"").

[***LEdHR1A] [1I]  [***LEdHR2A] [2C]  [***LEdHR6A] [6C] For these reasons, stay
and abeyance should be available only in limited circumstances.   [HN2] Because
granting a stay effectively excuses a petitioner's failure to present his claims
first to the state courts, stay and abeyance is only appropriate when the
district court determines there was good cause for the petitioner's failure to
exhaust his claims first in state court.  Moreover, even if a petitioner had
good cause for that failure, the district court would abuse its discretion if it
were to grant him a stay when his unexhausted claims are plainly meritless.  Cf.
28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(2) [28 U.S.C.S. § 2254(b)(2)] (""An application for a writ of
habeas corpus may be denied on the merits, notwithstanding the  [***452]
failure of the applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the
State"").

[***LEdHR3A] [3C]   [HN3] Even where stay and abeyance is appropriate, the
district court's discretion in structuring the stay is limited by the timeliness
concerns reflected in AEDPA.  A mixed petition should not be stayed
indefinitely.  Though, generally, a prisoner's ""principal interest . . . is in
obtaining speedy federal relief on his claims,""  Lundy, supra, at 520, 71 L. Ed.
2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198 (plurality opinion), not all petitioners have an
incentive to obtain federal relief as quickly as possible.  In particular,
capital petitioners might deliberately engage in dilatory tactics to prolong
their  [*278]  incarceration and avoid execution of the sentence of death.
Without time limits, petitioners could frustrate AEDPA's goal of finality by
dragging out indefinitely their federal habeas review.  Thus, district courts
should place reasonable time limits on a petitioner's trip to state court and
back.  See, e.g.,  Zarvela, 254 F.3d, at 381 (""[District courts] should
explicitly condition the stay on the prisoner's pursuing state court remedies
within a brief interval, normally 30 days, after the stay is entered and
returning to federal court within a similarly brief interval, normally 30 days
after state court exhaustion is completed"").  And if a petitioner engages in
abusive litigation tactics or intentional delay, the district court should not
grant him a stay at all.  See  id., at 380-381.

[***LEdHR4A] [4C]  [***LEdHR5A] [5C] On the other hand,  [HN4] it likely would
be an abuse of discretion for a district court to deny a stay and to dismiss a
mixed petition if the petitioner had good cause for his failure to exhaust, his
unexhausted claims are potentially meritorious, and there is no indication that
the petitioner engaged in intentionally dilatory litigation tactics. In such
circumstances, the district court should stay, rather than dismiss, the mixed
petition.  See  Lundy, 455 U.S., at 522, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198 (the
total exhaustion requirement was not intended to ""unreasonably impair the
prisoner's right to relief"").  In such a case, the petitioner's interest in
obtaining federal review of his claims outweighs the competing interests in
finality and speedy resolution of federal petitions.  For the same reason, if a
petitioner presents a district court with a mixed petition and the court
determines that stay and abeyance is inappropriate, the court should allow the
petitioner to delete the unexhausted claims and to proceed with the exhausted
claims if dismissal of the entire petition would unreasonably impair the
petitioner's right to obtain federal relief.  See  id., at 520, 71 L. Ed. 2d
379, 102 S. Ct. 1198 (plurality opinion) (""[A petitioner] can always amend the
petition to delete the unexhausted claims, rather than returning to state court
to exhaust all of his claims"").

[*279]   [***LEdHR6A] [6D] The Court of Appeals erred to the extent it concluded
that stay and abeyance is always impermissible.  We therefore vacate the
judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for that court to
determine, consistent with this opinion,  [**1536]  whether the District Court's
grant of a stay in this case constituted an abuse of discretion.

It is so ordered.  [***453]

While I join the Court's opinion, I do so on the understanding that its
reference to ""good cause"" for failing to exhaust state remedies more promptly,
ante, at 277, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 452, is not intended to impose the sort of
strict and inflexible requirement that would ""'trap the unwary pro se

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer join, concurring

I join the Court's opinion with one reservation, not doctrinal but practical.
Instead of conditioning stay-and-abeyance on ""good cause"" for delay, ante, at
277, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 452, I would simply hold the order unavailable on a
demonstration of ""intentionally dilatory litigation tactics,"" ante, at 278, 161
L. Ed. 2d, at 452.  The trickiness of some exhaustion determinations promises to
infect issues of good cause when a court finds a failure to exhaust; pro se
petitioners (as most habeas petitioners are) do not come well trained to address
such matters.  I fear that threshold enquiries into good cause will give the
district courts too much trouble to be worth the time; far better to wait for
the alarm to sound when there is some indication that a petitioner is gaming the
system.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A] Two state prisoners brought an action under 42 USC § 1983 [42
USCS § 1983] claiming that Ohio's state parole procedures violate the Federal
Constitution.  The prisoners seek declaratory and injunctive relief.  The
question before us is whether they [**1245]  may bring such an action under Rev
Stat § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 [42 USCS § 1983], the Civil Rights Act of 1871, or
whether they must instead seek relief exclusively under the federal habeas
corpus statutes.  We conclude that these actions may be brought under § 1983.

I

The two respondents, William Dotson and Rogerico Johnson, are currently serving
lengthy terms in Ohio prisons. Dotson began to serve a life sentence in 1981.
The parole board rejected his first parole request in 1995; and a parole
officer, after reviewing Dotson's records in the year 2000, determined that he
should not receive further consideration for parole for at least five more
years.  In reaching this conclusion about Dotson's parole eligibility, the
officer used parole guidelines first adopted in 1998, after Dotson  [*77]  began
to serve his term.  Dotson claims that the retroactive application of these new,
harsher guidelines to his preguidelines case violates the Constitution's Ex Post
Facto and Due Process Clauses.  He seeks a federal-court declaration to that
effect as well as a permanent injunction ordering prison officials to grant him
an ""immediate parole hearing in accordance with the statutory laws and
administrative rules in place when [he] committed his crimes."" App. 20 (Dotson
Complaint, Prospective Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, P 3).

Johnson began to serve a 10- to 30-year prison term in 1992.  The parole board
considered and rejected his first parole request in 1999, finding him unsuitable
for release.  In making this determination, the board applied the new 1998
guidelines.  Johnson too claims that the application of these new, harsher
guidelines to his preguidelines case violated the Constitution's Ex Post Facto
Clause.  He also alleges that the parole board's proceedings (by having too few
members present and by denying him an adequate opportunity to speak) violated
the Constitution's Due Process Clause.  Johnson's complaint seeks a new parole
hearing conducted under constitutionally proper procedures and an injunction
ordering the State to comply with constitutional due process and ex post facto
requirements in the future.

Both prisoners brought § 1983 actions in federal court.  In each case, the
Federal District Court concluded that a § 1983 action does not lie and that the
prisoner would have to seek relief through a habeas corpus suit.  Dotson v.
Wilkinson, No. 3:00 CV 7303 (ND Ohio, Aug. 7, 2000); Johnson v. Ghee, No. 4:00
CV 1075 (ND Ohio, July 16, 2000).  Each prisoner appealed.  The Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit ultimately consolidated the two appeals and heard both
cases en banc.  The court found that the actions could proceed under § 1983, and
it reversed the lower  [***260]  courts.   329 F.3d 463, 472 (2003).  Ohio
parole officials then petitioned for certiorari, and we granted review.

[*78]   II

[***LEdHR2A] [2A] This Court has held that  [HN1] a prisoner in state custody
cannot use a § 1983 action to challenge ""the fact or duration of his
confinement.""  Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 489, 36 L. Ed. 2d 439, 93 S.
Ct. 1827 (1973); see also  Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 554, 41 L. Ed. 2d
935, 94 S. Ct. 2963 (1974);  Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 481, 129 L. Ed. 2d
383, 114 S. Ct. 2364 (1994);  Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U.S. 641, 648, 137 L. Ed.
2d 906, 117 S. Ct. 1584 (1997).  He must seek federal habeas corpus relief (or
appropriate state relief) instead.

[***LEdHR1A] [1B] Ohio points out that the inmates in these cases attack their
parole-eligibility proceedings (Dotson) and parole-suitability proceedings
(Johnson) only because they [**1246]  believe that victory on their claims will
lead to speedier release from prison. Consequently, Ohio argues, the prisoners'
lawsuits, in effect, collaterally attack the duration of their confinement;
hence, such a claim may only be brought through a habeas corpus action, not
through § 1983.

The problem with Ohio's argument lies in its jump from a true premise (that in
all likelihood the prisoners hope these actions will help bring about earlier
release) to a faulty conclusion (that habeas is their sole avenue for relief).
A consideration of this Court's case law makes clear that the connection between
the constitutionality of the prisoners' parole proceedings and release from
confinement is too tenuous here to achieve Ohio's legal door-closing objective.

[***LEdHR2A] [2B]  [***LEdHR3] [3] The Court initially addressed the
relationship between § 1983 and the federal habeas statutes in  Preiser v.
Rodriguez, supra. In that case, state prisoners brought civil rights actions
attacking the constitutionality of prison disciplinary proceedings that had led
to the deprivation of their good-time credits.   Id., at 476, 36 L. Ed. 2d 439,
93 S. Ct. 1827.  The Court conceded that the language of § 1983 literally covers
their claims.  See § 1983 (authorizing claims alleging the deprivation of
constitutional rights against every ""person"" acting ""under color of"" state law).
But, the Court noted, the language of the federal habeas statutes applies as
well.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(a) [28 USCS § 2254(a)] (permitting claims by a
person being held ""in custody [*79]  in violation of the Constitution"").
Moreover, the Court observed, the language of the habeas statute is more
specific, and the writ's history makes clear that it traditionally ""has been
accepted as the specific instrument to obtain release from [unlawful]
confinement.""  Preiser, 411 U.S., at 486, 36 L. Ed. 2d 439, 93 S. Ct. 1827.
Finally, habeas corpus actions require a petitioner fully to exhaust state
remedies, which § 1983 does not.   Id., at 490-491, 36 L. Ed. 2d 439, 93 S. Ct.
1827; see also  Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457 U.S. 496, 507, 73 L. Ed.
2d 172, 102 S. Ct. 2557 (1982).  These considerations of linguistic specificity,
history, and comity led the Court to find an implicit exception from § 1983's
otherwise broad scope for actions that lie ""within the core of habeas corpus.""
Preiser, 411 U.S., at 487, 36 L. Ed. 2d 439, 93 S. Ct. 1827.

[***LEdHR2A] [2C] Defining the scope of that exception, the Court concluded that
a § 1983 action will not lie when a  [***261]  state prisoner challenges ""the
fact or duration of his confinement,""  id., at 489, 36 L. Ed. 2d 439, 93 S. Ct.
1827, and seeks either ""immediate release from prison,"" or the ""shortening"" of
his term of confinement,  id., at 482, 36 L. Ed. 2d 439, 93 S. Ct. 1827.
Because an action for restoration of good-time credits in effect demands
immediate release or a shorter period of detention, it attacks ""the very
duration of . . . physical confinement,""  id., at 487-488, 36 L. Ed. 2d 439, 93
S. Ct. 1827, and thus lies at ""the core of habeas corpus,""  id., at 487, 36 L.
Ed. 2d 439, 93 S. Ct. 1827.  Therefore, the Court held, the Preiser prisoners
could not pursue their claims under § 1983.

In  Wolff v. McDonnell, supra, the Court elaborated the contours of this habeas
corpus ""core."" As in Preiser, state prisoners brought a § 1983 action
challenging prison officials' revocation of good-time credits by means of
constitutionally deficient disciplinary proceedings.   418 U.S., at 553, 41 L.
Ed. 2d 935, 94 S. Ct. 2963.  The Court held that the prisoners could not use §
1983 to obtain restoration of the credits because Preiser had held that ""an
injunction restoring good time improperly taken is foreclosed.""  418 U.S., at
555, 41 L. Ed. 2d 935, 94 S. Ct. 2963.  But the inmates could use § 1983 to
obtain a declaration (""as a predicate to"" their requested damages award) that
the disciplinary procedures were invalid.  Ibid. They could also seek ""by way of
ancillary  [*80]  relief[,] an otherwise proper injunction enjoining the
prospective enforcement of invalid prison [**1247]  regulations."" Ibid.
(emphasis added).  In neither case would victory for the prisoners necessarily
have meant immediate release or a shorter period of incarceration; the prisoners
attacked only the ""wrong procedures, not . . . the wrong result (i.e., [the
denial of] good-time credits).""  Heck, supra, at 483, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383, 114 S.
Ct. 2364 (discussing Wolff).

In Heck, the Court considered a different, but related, circumstance.  A state
prisoner brought a § 1983 action for damages, challenging the conduct of state
officials who, the prisoner claimed, had unconstitutionally caused his
conviction by improperly investigating his crime and destroying evidence.   512
U.S., at 479, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383, 114 S. Ct. 2364.  The Court pointed to ""the
hoary principle that civil tort actions are not appropriate vehicles for
challenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments.""  Id., at 486, 129
L. Ed. 2d 383, 114 S. Ct. 2364.  And it held that where ""establishing the basis
for the damages claim necessarily demonstrates the invalidity of the
conviction,""  id., at 481-482, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383, 114 S. Ct. 2364, a § 1983
action will not lie ""unless . . . the conviction or sentence has already been
invalidated,""  id., at 487, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383, 114 S. Ct. 2364.  The Court then
added that, where the § 1983 action, ""even if successful, will not demonstrate
the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment . . ., the action should be
allowed to proceed."" Ibid. (footnote omitted).

Finally, in  Edwards v. Balisok, supra, the Court returned to the prison
disciplinary procedure context of the kind it had addressed previously in
Preiser and Wolff. Balisok sought ""a declaration that the procedures employed by
state officials [to deprive him of good-time credits] violated due process, . .
. damages for use of the unconstitutional procedures, [and] an injunction to
prevent future violations.""  520 U.S., at 643, 137 L. Ed.  [***262]  2d 906, 117
S. Ct. 1584.  Applying Heck, the Court found that habeas was the sole vehicle
for the inmate's constitutional challenge insofar as the prisoner sought
declaratory relief and money damages, because the ""principal procedural defect
complained  [*81]  of,"" namely, deceit and bias on the part of the
decisionmaker, ""would, if established, necessarily imply the invalidity of the
deprivation of [Balisok's] good-time credits.""  520 U.S., at 646, 137 L. Ed. 2d
906, 117 S. Ct. 1584.  Hence, success on the prisoner's claim for money damages
(and the accompanying claim for declaratory relief) would ""necessarily imply the
invalidity of the punishment imposed.""  Id., at 648, 137 L. Ed. 2d 906, 117 S.
Ct. 1584.  Nonetheless, the prisoner's claim for an injunction barring future
unconstitutional procedures did not fall within habeas' exclusive domain.  That
is because ""[o]rdinarily, a prayer for such prospective relief will not
'necessarily imply' the invalidity of a previous loss of good-time credits.""
Ibid.

Throughout the legal journey from Preiser to Balisok the Court has focused on
the need to ensure that state prisoners use only habeas corpus (or similar
state) remedies when they seek to invalidate the duration of their
confinement--either directly through an injunction compelling speedier release
or indirectly through a judicial determination that necessarily implies the
unlawfulness of the State's custody. Thus, Preiser found an implied exception to
§ 1983's coverage where the claim seeks--not where it simply ""relates
to""--""core"" habeas corpus relief, i.e., where a state prisoner requests present
or future release.  Cf. post, at ____,  161 L. Ed. 2d, at 269 (Kennedy, J.,
dissenting) (arguing that Preiser covers challenges that ""relate . . . to"" the
duration of confinement). Wolff makes clear that § 1983 remains available for
procedural challenges where success in the action would not necessarily spell
immediate or speedier release for the prisoner. [**1248]   Heck specifies that a
prisoner cannot use § 1983 to obtain damages where success would necessarily
imply the unlawfulness of a (not previously invalidated) conviction or sentence.
And Balisok, like Wolff, demonstrates that habeas remedies do not displace §
1983 actions where success in the civil rights suit would not necessarily
vitiate the legality of (not previously invalidated) state confinement. These
cases, taken together, indicate that  [HN2] a state prisoner's § 1983 action is
[*82]  barred (absent prior invalidation)--no matter the relief sought (damages
or equitable relief), no matter the target of the prisoner's suit (state conduct
leading to conviction or internal prison proceedings)--if success in that action
would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of confinement or its duration.

[***LEdHR1A] [1C] Applying these principles to the present case, we conclude
that respondents' claims are cognizable under § 1983, i.e., they do not fall
within the implicit habeas exception.  Dotson and Johnson seek relief that will
render invalid the state procedures used to deny parole eligibility (Dotson) and
parole suitability (Johnson).  See  Wolff, 418 U.S., at 554-555, 41 L. Ed. 2d
935, 94 S. Ct. 2963. Neither respondent seeks an injunction ordering his
immediate or speedier release into the community.  See  Preiser, 411 U.S., at
500, 36 L. Ed. 2d 439, 93 S. Ct. 1827;  Wolff, supra, at 554, 41 L. Ed. 2d 935,
94 S. Ct. 2963.  And as in Wolff, a favorable judgment  [***263]  will not
""necessarily imply the invalidity of [their] conviction[s] or sentence[s].""
Heck, supra, at 487, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383, 114 S. Ct. 2364.  Success for Dotson
does not mean immediate release from confinement or a shorter stay in prison; it
means at most new eligibility review, which at most will speed consideration of
a new parole application.  Success for Johnson means at most a new parole
hearing at which Ohio parole authorities may, in their discretion, decline to
shorten his prison term.  See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 2967.03 (Lexis 2003)
(describing the parole authority's broad discretionary powers);  Inmates of
Orient Correctional Inst. v. Ohio State Adult Parole Auth., 929 F.2d 233, 236
(CA6 1991) (same); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 18 (petitioners' counsel conceding
that success on respondents' claims would not inevitably lead to release).
Because neither prisoner's claim would necessarily spell speedier release,
neither lies at ""the core of habeas corpus.""  Preiser, supra, at 489, 36 L. Ed.
2d 439, 93 S. Ct. 1827.  Finally, the prisoners' claims for future relief
(which, if successful, will not necessarily imply the invalidity of confinement
or shorten its duration) are yet more distant from that core.  See  Balisok,
supra, at 648, 137 L. Ed. 2d 906, 117 S. Ct. 1584.

[*83]   [***LEdHR2A] [2D] The dissent disagrees with our legal analysis and
advocates use of a different legal standard in critical part because, in its
view, (1) a habeas challenge to a sentence (a ""core"" challenge) does not
necessarily produce the prisoner's ""release"" (so our standard ""must be . . .
wrong""), see post, at 88, 91,  161 L. Ed. 2d, at 266-267, 268; and (2) Heck's
standard is irrelevant because Heck concerned only damages, see post, at 91,
161 L. Ed. 2d, at 268.  As to the first, we believe that a case challenging a
sentence seeks a prisoner's ""release"" in the only pertinent sense: It seeks
invalidation (in whole or in part) of the judgment authorizing the prisoner's
confinement; the fact that the State may seek a new judgment (through a new
trial or a new sentencing proceeding) is beside the point.  As to the second,
Balisok applied Heck's standard and addressed a claim seeking not only damages,
but also a separate declaration that the State's procedures were unlawful.  See
520 U.S., at 643, 647-648, 137 L. Ed. 2d 906, 117 S. Ct. 1584.

III

[***LEdHR1A] [1D]  [***LEdHR2A] [2E] Ohio makes two additional arguments.
First, Ohio points to language in Heck [**1249]  indicating that a prisoner's §
1983 damages action cannot lie where a favorable judgment would ""necessarily
imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence.""  512 U.S., at 487, 129 L.
Ed. 2d 383, 114 S. Ct. 2364 (emphasis added).  Ohio then argues that its parole
proceedings are part of the prisoners' ""sentence[s]""--indeed, an aspect of the
""sentence[s]"" that the § 1983 claims, if successful, will invalidate.

We do not find this argument persuasive.  In context, Heck uses the word
""sentence"" to refer not to prison procedures, but to substantive determinations
as to the length of confinement. See  Muhammad v. Close, 540 U.S. 749, 751, n.
1, 158 L. Ed. 2d 32, 124 S. Ct. 1303 (2004) (per curiam) (""[T]he incarceration
that matters under Heck is the incarceration ordered by the original judgment of
conviction"").  Heck uses the word ""sentence"" interchangeably with such other
terms as ""continuing confinement"" and ""imprisonment.""  512 U.S.,  [***264]  at
483, 486, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383, 114 S. Ct. 2364; see also   [*84]  Balisok, supra,
at 645, 648, 137 L. Ed. 2d 906, 117 S. Ct. 1584 (referring to the invalidity of
""the judgment"" or ""punishment imposed"").  So understood, Heck is consistent with
other cases permitting prisoners to bring § 1983 challenges to prison
administrative decisions.  See, e.g.,  Wolff, supra, at 554-555, 41 L. Ed. 2d
935, 94 S. Ct. 2963;  Muhammad, 540 U.S., at 754, 158 L. Ed. 2d 32, 124 S. Ct.
1303; see also ibid. (rejecting ""the mistaken view . . . that Heck applies
categorically to all suits challenging prison disciplinary proceedings"").
Indeed,  [HN3] this Court has repeatedly permitted prisoners to bring § 1983
actions challenging the conditions of their confinement--conditions that, were
Ohio right, might be considered part of the ""sentence."" See, e.g.,  Cooper v.
Pate, 378 U.S. 546, 12 L. Ed. 2d 1030, 84 S. Ct. 1733 (1964) (per curiam);
Wilwording v. Swenson, 404 U.S. 249, 251, 30 L. Ed. 2d 418, 92 S. Ct. 407 (1971)
(per curiam). And this interpretation of Heck is consistent with Balisok, where
the Court held the prisoner's suit Heck-barred not because it sought
nullification of the disciplinary procedures but rather because nullification of
the disciplinary procedures would lead necessarily to restoration of good-time
credits and hence the shortening of the prisoner's sentence.  520 U.S., at 646,
137 L. Ed. 2d 906, 117 S. Ct. 1584.

[***LEdHR1A] [1E]  [***LEdHR4] [4] Second, Ohio says that a decision in favor of
respondents would break faith with principles of federal/state comity by opening
the door to federal court without prior exhaustion of state-court remedies.  Our
earlier cases, however, have already placed the States' important comity
considerations in the balance, weighed them against the competing need to
vindicate federal rights without exhaustion, and concluded that  [HN4] prisoners
may bring their claims without fully exhausting state-court remedies so long as
their suits, if established, would not necessarily invalidate state-imposed
confinement. See Part II, supra. Thus, we see no reason for moving the line
these cases draw--particularly since Congress has already strengthened the
requirement that prisoners exhaust state administrative remedies as a
precondition to any § 1983 action.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) [42 USCS § 1997e(a)
];  Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524, 152 L. Ed. 2d 12, 122 S. Ct. 983 (2002)
.

[*85]  For these reasons, the Sixth Circuit's judgment is affirmed, and the case
is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

CONCUR BY: SCALIA; THOMAS

CONCUR

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring.

I join the Court's opinion, which in my view reads  Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S.
477, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383, 114 S. Ct. 2364 (1994), and  Edwards v. Balisok, 520
U.S. 641, 137 L. Ed. 2d 906, 117 S. Ct. 1584 (1997), correctly.  And I am in
full agreement [**1250]  with the Court's holding that ""[b]ecause neither
prisoner's claim would necessarily spell speedier release, neither lies at 'the
core of habeas corpus'"" and both may be brought under Rev Stat § 1979, 42 U.S.C.
§ 1983.   Ante, at ____, 161 L Ed 2d, at 263.  I write separately to note that a
contrary holding would require  [***265]  us to broaden the scope of habeas
relief beyond recognition.

Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 36 L. Ed. 2d 439, 93 S. Ct. 1827 (1973), and
the cases that follow it hold that Congress, in enacting § 1983, preserved the
habeas corpus statute as the sole authorization for challenges to allegedly
unlawful confinement.  Id., at 489-490, 36 L. Ed. 2d 439, 93 S. Ct. 1827.  At
the time of § 1983's adoption, the federal habeas statute mirrored the
common-law writ of habeas corpus, in that it authorized a single form of relief:
the prisoner's immediate release from custody. See Act of Feb. 5, 1867, § 1, 14
Stat. 386.  Congress shortly thereafter amended the statute, authorizing federal
habeas courts to ""dispose of the party as law and justice require,"" Rev Stat §
761.  The statute reads virtually the same today, 28 U.S.C. § 2243 [28 USCS §
2243] (""dispose of the matter as law and justice require"").  We have interpreted
this broader remedial language to permit relief short of release.  For example,
when a habeas petitioner challenges only one of several consecutive sentences,
the court may invalidate the challenged sentence even though the prisoner
remains in custody to serve the others.  See  Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U.S. 54, 67,
20 L. Ed. 2d 426, 88 S. Ct. 1549 (1968);  Walker v. Wainwright, 390 U.S. 335,
336-337, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1215, 88 S. Ct. 962 (1968) (per curiam).  [*86]  Thus, in
Preiser we held the prisoners' § 1983 action barred because the relief it
sought--restoration of good-time credits, which would shorten the prisoners'
incarceration and hasten the date on which they would be transferred to
supervised release--was available in habeas.  See  411 U.S., at 487-488, 36 L.
Ed. 2d 439, 93 S. Ct. 1827.

It is one thing to say that permissible habeas relief, as our cases interpret
the statute, includes ordering a ""quantum change in the level of custody,""
Graham v. Broglin, 922 F.2d 379, 381 (CA7 1991) (Posner, J.), such as release
from incarceration to parole. It is quite another to say that the habeas statute
authorizes federal courts to order relief that neither terminates custody,
accelerates the future date of release from custody, nor reduces the level of
custody. That is what is sought here: the mandating of a new parole hearing that
may or may not result in release, prescription of the composition of the hearing
panel, and specification of the procedures to be followed.  A holding that this
sort of judicial immersion in the administration of discretionary parole lies at
the ""core of habeas"" would utterly sever the writ from its common-law roots.
Cf.  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 526, n. 6, 60 L. Ed. 2d 447, 99 S. Ct. 1861
(1979) (treating as open the question whether prison-conditions claims are
cognizable in habeas).  The dissent suggests that because a habeas court may
issue a conditional writ ordering a prisoner released unless the State conducts
a new sentencing proceeding, the court may also issue a conditional writ
ordering release absent a new parole proceeding.  See post, at 88 - 91,  161 L.
Ed. 2d, at 266-267, 268 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).  But the prisoner who shows
that his sentencing was unconstitutional is actually entitled to release,
because the judgment pursuant to which he is confined has been invalidated; the
conditional writ serves only to ""delay the release . . . in order to provide the
State an opportunity to correct the constitutional violation.""  Hilton v.
Braunskill, [***266]  481 U.S. 770, 775, 95 L. Ed. 2d 724, 107 S. Ct. 2113
(1987); see  In re Bonner, 151 U.S. 242, 259, 262, 38 L. Ed. 149, 14 S. Ct. 323
(1894) (conditional writ for proper resentencing).  [**1251]  By contrast, the
validly  [*87]  sentenced prisoner who shows only that the State made a
procedural error in denying discretionary parole has not established a right to
release, and so cannot obtain habeas relief--conditional or otherwise.
Conditional writs enable habeas courts to give States time to replace an invalid
judgment with a valid one, and the consequence when they fail to do so is always
release.  Conditional writs are not an all-purpose weapon with which federal
habeas courts can extort from the respondent custodian forms of relief short of
release, whether a new parole hearing or a new mattress in the applicant's cell.

Petitioners counter that we need not be concerned about this expansion of habeas
relief because prisoners will naturally prefer § 1983 to habeas corpus, in light
of the burdensome prerequisites attached to habeas relief by 28 U.S.C. § 2254[28
USCS § 2254]. But those prerequisites, such as exhaustion of state remedies,
reliance on ""clearly established Federal law,"" and deference to previous
findings of fact, apply only to ""a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of
a State court,"" §§ 2254(b)(1), (d)(1), (e)(1).  By contrast, § 2243's
delineation of the scope of permissible relief applies to all federal habeas
proceedings, whether the petitioner is in federal or state custody, see §
2241(c).  Thus, while § 2254 may shield petitioners and their fellow state
wardens from the impact of the broadened writ they urge us to create, not every
warden responding to a habeas petition can claim the same protection.  And
federal prisoners, whose custodians are not acting under color of state law and
hence cannot be sued under § 1983, have greater incentives to shoehorn their
claims into habeas.

Finally, I note that the Court's opinion focuses correctly on whether the claims
respondents pleaded were claims that may be pursued in habeas--not on whether
respondents can be successful in obtaining habeas relief on those claims.  See,
e.g., ante, at 80-81,  161 L. Ed. 2d, at 262.  Thus, for example, a prisoner who
wishes to challenge the length of his confinement, but who cannot obtain federal
habeas relief because of the statute  [*88]  of limitations or the restrictions
on successive petitions, §§ 2244(a), (b), (d), cannot use the unavailability of
federal habeas relief in his individual case as grounds for proceeding under §
1983.  Cf.  Preiser, supra, at 489-490, 36 L. Ed. 2d 439, 93 S. Ct. 1827 (""It
would wholly frustrate explicit congressional intent to hold that [state
prisoners] could evade [the exhaustion] requirement by the simple expedient of
putting a different label on their pleadings""). With these observations, I join
the Court's opinion.

DISSENT BY: KENNEDY

DISSENT

Justice Kennedy, dissenting.

In this case, the Court insists that an attack on parole proceedings brought
under Rev Stat § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983[42 USCS § 1983], may not be dismissed on
the grounds that habeas corpus is the exclusive remedy for such claims.  The
primary reason offered for the Court's holding is that an order entitling a
prisoner to a new parole proceeding might not result in his early release.
[***267]  That reason, however, applies with equal logic and force to a
sentencing proceeding.  And since it is elementary that habeas is the
appropriate remedy for challenging a sentence, something must be quite wrong
with the Court's own first premise.

Everyone knows that when a prisoner succeeds in a habeas action and obtains a
new sentencing hearing, the sentence may or may not be reduced.  The sentence
can end up being just the same, or perhaps longer.  The prisoner's early release
is by no means assured simply because the first sentence was found unlawful.
Yet no one [**1252]  would say that an attack on judicial sentencing proceedings
following conviction may be raised through an action under § 1983.  The
inconsistency in the Court's treatment of sentencing proceedings and parole
proceedings is thus difficult to justify.  It is, furthermore, in tension with
our precedents.  For these reasons, I write this respectful dissent.

Challenges to parole proceedings are cognizable in habeas.  Here respondents
challenge parole determinations that not  [*89]  only deny release (or
eligibility for consideration for release) but also guarantee continued
confinement until the next scheduled parole proceeding.  See ante, at 76 - 77,
161 L. Ed. 2d, at 259 (majority opinion).  If a parole determination is made in
a proceeding flawed by errors of constitutional dimensions, as these respondents
now allege, their continued confinement may well be the result of constitutional
violation.  Respondents thus raise a cognizable habeas claim of being ""in
custody in violation of the Constitution."" 28 U.S.C. § 2241(c)(3) [28 USCS §
2241(c)(3)]; see also 1 R. Hertz & J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice
and Procedure § 9.1, pp 431-437, and n 33 (4th ed. 2001) (noting that ""[t]he
range of claims cognizable in federal habeas corpus"" includes challenges to ""the
duration of sentence (including on the basis of parole, good time, and other
prison- or administratively, as opposed to court-administered rules)"" and citing
numerous cases to that effect).  In recognition of this elementary principle,
this Court and the courts of appeals have adjudicated the merits of many parole
challenges in federal habeas corpus proceedings.  See, e.g.,  California Dep't
of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U.S. 499, 131 L. Ed. 2d 5"
"            GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL & WATER CONSERVATION DISTRICT, et al.,               Petitioners v. UNITED STATES ex rel. KAREN T. WILSON",545 U.S. 409,"

 [***LEdHR1A]  This case presents the question whether the 6-year statute of
limitations in the False Claims Act (FCA or Act), see 31 U.S.C. § 3731(b)(1),
governs FCA civil actions for retaliation, see § 3730(h).  We hold that it does
not and therefore conclude that the most closely analogous state limitations
period applies.

[**2447]  I

[HN1] The FCA prohibits any person from making false or fraudulent claims for
payment to the United States.  § 3729(a).  Persons who do so are liable for
civil penalties of up to $10,000 per claim and treble damages.  Ibid. The Act
sets forth two principal enforcement mechanisms for policing this proscription.
First, the Attorney General may sue to remedy  [*412]  violations of § 3729.  §
3730(a).  Second, private individuals may bring qui tam actions in the
Government's name for § 3729 violations.  § 3730(b)(1); see Vermont Agency of
Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 769-772, 146
L. Ed. 2d 836, 120 S. Ct. 1858 (2000).  The qui tam relator must give the
Government notice of the action, and the Government is entitled to intervene in
the suit.  § 3730(b)(2).  The relator receives up to 30 percent of the proceeds
of the action, in addition to attorney's fees and costs.  §§ 3730(d)(1), (2).

The 1986 amendments to the FCA created a third enforcement mechanism: a private
cause of action for an individual retaliated against by his employer for
assisting an FCA investigation or proceeding.  § 3730(h).  Section 3730(h)
provides in relevant part that  [***397]


      [HN2] ""[a]ny employee who is discharged, demoted, suspended,
     threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in
     the terms and conditions of employment by his or her employer because
     of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the employee or
     others in furtherance of an action under this section, including
     investigation for, initiation of, testimony for, or assistance in an
     action filed or to be filed under this section, shall be entitled to
     all relief necessary to make the employee whole.""



Remedies for retaliation include reinstatement, two times the amount of backpay
plus interest, special damages, litigation costs, and attorney's fees.  Ibid.

The 1986 amendments also revised the language of the 6-year statute of
limitations applicable to FCA actions.  The previous version of the statute
provided that ""[a] civil action under section 3730 of this title must be brought
within 6 years from the date the violation is committed."" § 3731(b) (1982 ed.).
The 1986 amendments revised this provision to read:


      [*413]

     [HN3] ""(b) A civil action under section 3730 may not be brought--

     ""(1) more than 6 years after the date on which the violation of
     section 3729 is committed, or

     ""(2) more than 3 years after the date when facts material to the right
     of action are known or reasonably should have been known by the
     official of the United States charged with responsibility to act in
     the circumstances, but in no event more than 10 years after the date
     on which the violation is committed . . . ."" § 3731(2000 ed.).



In January 2001, relator Karen T. Wilson brought an FCA qui tam and retaliation
action against petitioners.  Petitioners Graham County Soil and Water
Conservation District and Cherokee County Soil and Water Conservation District
are special-purpose local government entities; the other petitioners are various
local and federal officials.  Graham County District employed Wilson as a
secretary.  Wilson alleged that petitioners made numerous false claims for
payment to the United States in connection with a federal disaster relief
program, the Emergency Watershed Protection Program, App. 17-20, and in
connection with agricultural programs administered by North Carolina but funded
by the Federal Government, id., at 17-24.

Wilson contended, in addition, that Graham County District officials retaliated
[**2448]  against her for aiding federal officials in their investigation of
these false claims.  Id., at 25-30.  Wilson alerted federal officials to
petitioners' suspected fraudulent activities in December 1995 and cooperated
with the ensuing investigation.  Id., at 26-27.  Because of her cooperation, the
complaint alleged, Graham County District officials repeatedly harassed her from
1996 to 1997, eventually inducing her to resign in March 1997.  Id., at 28-30.

Petitioners successfully moved to dismiss Wilson's retaliation action as
untimely.  They argued that the 6-year limitations period provided in §
3731(b)(1) did not apply to Wilson's  [*414]  retaliation action.  Absent an
applicable federal limitations period, they asked the District Court to borrow
North Carolina's 3-year statute of limitations for retaliatory-discharge
actions.  The District Court  [***398]  agreed and dismissed the retaliation
claim, since Wilson filed it more than three years after her March 1997
discharge.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a-70a.  The court certified that ruling for
interlocutory appeal.  224 F. Supp. 2d 1042, 1050-1051 (WDNC 2002).

On interlocutory appeal, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit reversed.  In the majority's view, the plain language of § 3731(b)(1)
supplies a limitations period for retaliation actions, making it unnecessary to
borrow one from North Carolina law.  The court reasoned that § 3731(b)(1)
governs § 3730(h) retaliation actions, because it applies its 6-year limitations
period to ""'[a] civil action under section 3730.'""  367 F.3d 245, 251 (2004)
(brackets in original).

[***LEdHR2A]  We granted certiorari to resolve a disagreement among the Courts
of Appeals regarding whether § 3731(b)(1)'s 6-year statute of limitations
applies to § 3730(h) retaliation actions or whether, instead, the most closely
analogous state limitations period governs. 543 U.S. 1042, 160 L. Ed. 2d 609,
125 S. Ct. 823 (2005).  Compare Neal v. Honeywell Inc., 33 F.3d 860, 865-866
(CA7 1994) (holding that FCA 6-year period applies), with United States ex rel.
Lujan v. Hughes Aircraft Co., 162 F.3d 1027, 1034-1035 (CA9 1998) (holding that
most closely analogous state limitations period governs).

II

[HN4]  [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR3] [3] To determine the applicable statute of
limitations for a cause of action created by a federal statute, we first ask
whether the statute expressly supplies a limitations period. If it does not, we
generally ""borrow"" the most closely analogous state limitations period. See
North Star Steel Co. v. Thomas, 515 U.S. 29, 33-34, 132 L. Ed. 2d 27, 115 S. Ct.
1927 (1995); Reed v. Transportation Union, 488 U.S. 319, 324, 102 L. Ed. 2d 665,
109 S. Ct. 621 (1989); Agency Holding Corp. v.  [*415]  Malley-Duff &
Associates, Inc., 483 U.S. 143, 157-165, 97 L. Ed. 2d 121, 107 S. Ct. 2759
(1987) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (tracing history of borrowing state
limitations periods).  In the rare case, we have even borrowed analogous federal
limitations periods in the absence of an expressly applicable one, see, e.g.,
id., at 150-157, 97 L. Ed. 2d 121, 107 S. Ct. 2759, but no party points to a
reason why we should do so here, and we can think of none.  The only arguably
applicable express statute of limitations is the 6-year limit set forth in §
3731(b)(1).  The question, then, is whether § 3731(b)(1) applies by its terms to
retaliation actions under § 3730(h); if it does not, our cases dictate that the
most closely analogous state limitations period applies.

[HN5]  [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR4] [4] Under § 3731(b)(1), ""[a] civil action
under section 3730 may not be brought . . . more than 6 years after the date on
which the violation of section 3729 is committed."" Following the Court of
Appeals' lead and [**2449]  supported by the United States appearing as amicus
curiae, Wilson argues that this language unambiguously applies to FCA
retaliation actions.  She points out that § 3731(b)(1) applies a 6-year
limitations period to ""a civil action under section 3730,"" and that § 3730(h)
actions arise under § 3730; hence, she claims, the 6-year period governs §
3730(h) actions.  See Neal, supra, at 865-866 (arguing same).  We think the
statute is more complex than this argument supposes.   [HN6] Statutory language
has meaning only in context,  [***399]  see, e.g., Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S.
1, 9, 160 L. Ed. 2d 271, 125 S. Ct. 377 (2004), and § 3731(b)(1), read in its
proper context, does not govern § 3730(h) actions for retaliation.

Section 3731(b)(1) is ambiguous, rather than clear, about whether a § 3730(h)
retaliation action is ""a civil action under section 3730."" Another reasonable
reading is that it applies only to actions arising under §§ 3730(a) and (b), not
to § 3730(h) retaliation actions.  That reading is suggested by the language in
§ 3731(b)(1) tying the start of the time limit to ""the date on which the
violation of section 3729 is committed."" In other words, the time limit begins
to run on the date the defendant submitted a false claim for payment.   [*416]
See supra, at 412-413, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 396.  This language casts doubt on
whether § 3731(b)(1) specifies a limitations period for retaliation actions.
For even a well-pleaded retaliation complaint need not allege that the defendant
submitted a false claim, leaving the limitations period without a starting point
if § 3731(b)(1) is applicable.  A retaliation plaintiff, instead, need prove
only that the defendant retaliated against him for engaging in ""lawful acts done
. . . in furtherance of"" an FCA ""action filed or to be filed,"" § 3730(h),
language that protects an employee's conduct even if the target of an
investigation or action to be filed was innocent. 1 Applying § 3731(b)(1) to FCA
retaliation actions, then, sits uneasily with § 3731(b)(1)'s language, which
assumes that well-pleaded ""action[s] under section 3730"" to which it is
applicable include a ""violation of section 3729"" certain from which to start the
time running.  Section 3731(b)(1), by contrast, naturally applies to
well-pleaded §§ 3730(a) and (b) actions.  They require the plaintiff to plead
that the defendant submitted a false claim for payment, and therefore
necessarily specify when § 3731(b)(1)'s time limit begins.  This textual
anomaly, at a minimum, shows that § 3731(b)(1) is ambiguous about whether
""action under section 3730"" means all actions under § 3730, or only §§ 3730(a)
and (b) actions.

 [*417]    [***LEdHR1A]  Wilson and the United States dispute that the statute
contains this anomaly, and instead urge that it clearly applies by its terms to
all § 3730 actions.  They point out that every § 3730(h) action requires the
plaintiff to prove that he engaged in [**2450]  protected conduct related to at
least a suspected violation of § 3729, and argue that § 3731(b)(1)'s limitations
period simply begins to run on the date of the suspected violation.  Assuming,
without deciding, that § 3730(h) retaliation actions have as an element a
suspected violation of § 3729, their interpretation indeed  [***400]  removes
the anomaly, but only at the cost of reading into the statute the word
""suspected"" before the phrase ""violation of section 3729."" Section 3731(b)(1)
speaks of ""violation[s] of section 3729""--actual, not suspected, ones.  Wilson
and the United States answer that this argument proves too much, because even §§
3730(a) and (b) actions involve only ""suspected"" violations of § 3729 at the
pleading stage of litigation; but this response misses the point.  Every §
3730(a) or (b) plaintiff who states or proves a valid claim for relief must
allege or prove an actual violation of § 3729; retaliation plaintiffs need only
allege or prove a suspected violation of § 3729 (or so we are willing to
assume).  The point is that § 3731(b)(1)'s language applies naturally to all
successfully pleaded or proved retaliation actions only if one reads ""suspected""
into its terms, as the dissent essentially concedes.  See post, at 425-426, 162
L. Ed. 2d, at 405 (opinion of Breyer, J.).

Section 3731(b)(1)'s literal text, then, is ambiguous. Wilson and the Government
ask us to read it as if it said ""the [suspected or actual] violation of section
3729."" Petitioners ask us to read § 3731(b) as if it said ""civil action under
section 3730[(a) or (b)].""

Two considerations convince us that  [HN7] the better way to resolve this
ambiguity is to read the 6-year period to govern only §§ 3730(a) and (b)
actions, and not § 3730(h) retaliation actions.  First, the very next subsection
of the statute, § 3731(c), also uses the similarly unqualified phrase ""action
[*418]  brought under section 3730"" to refer only to §§ 3730(a) and (b) actions.
Section 3731(c) provides that ""[i]n any action brought under section 3730, the
United States shall be required to prove all essential elements of the cause of
action, including damages, by a preponderance of the evidence.  "" As Wilson and
the United States concede, the context of this provision implies that the phrase
""any action brought under section 3730"" is limited to § 3730(a) actions brought
by the United States and § 3730(b) actions in which the United States intervenes
as a party, as those are the types of § 3730 actions in which the United States
necessarily participates.  Otherwise, the United States would be ""required to
prove all essential elements of the cause of action,"" § 3731(c), in all § 3730
actions, regardless of whether it participated in the action (a consequence the
dissent implicitly embraces by claiming that ""any action brought under section
3730"" in § 3731(c) means all § 3730 actions, see post, at 423-424, 162 L. Ed.
2d, at 403-404 (opinion of Breyer, J.)).  This implicit limitation of the phrase
""action under section 3730"" shows that Congress used the term ""action under
section 3730"" imprecisely in § 3731 and, in particular, that Congress sometimes
used the term to refer only to a subset of § 3730 actions.  It is reasonable to
read the same language in § 3731(b)(1) to be likewise limited.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR7] [7]  [***LEdHR8A]  Second, reading § 3731(b)(1) to
apply only to §§ 3730(a) and (b) actions is in keeping with the default rule
that Congress generally drafts statutes of limitations to begin when the cause
of action accrues.  [HN8] We have repeatedly recognized that Congress legislates
against the ""standard rule that the limitations period commences when the
plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.""  Bay Area Laundry and Dry
Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corp. of  [***401]  Cal., 522 U.S. 192,

action and statute of limitations arise at different times ""absen[t] . . . any
such indication in the statute""); TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 37, 151 L.

other indication, a statute of limitations begins to run at the time the
plaintiff has the right to apply to the court for relief"" (internal quotation
marks omitted)).  Therefore, where, as the case is here, there are two plausible
constructions of a statute of limitations, we should adopt the construction that
starts the time limit running when the cause of action (here retaliation)
accrues. 2

2  [***LEdHR8A]  Justice Stevens, we believe, misapplies this interpretive rule.
Post, p. 422, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 403 (opinion concurring in judgment).  He argues
that § 3731(b)(1) does not govern § 3730(h) actions because ""it is so unlikely
that a legislature would actually intend"" to start the statute of limitations
running before the cause of action accrues that he ""would presume that the
anomaly was the product of a drafting error"" regardless of whether the text is
ambiguous.  Dodd v. United States, ante, at 362, n. 1, 162 L. Ed. 2d 343, 125 S.
Ct. 2478, 2005 U.S. LEXIS 4847 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  This is not the
proper analysis.  Section 3731(b)(1) is ambiguous because its text, literally
read, admits of two plausible interpretations.  Supra, at 415-417, 162 L. Ed.
2d, at 399-400.  We apply the rule that Congress generally drafts statutes of
limitations to begin when the cause of action accrues to resolve that ambiguity,
not to create it in the first instance.

  [***LEdHR1A]  This approach resolves the ambiguity in § 3731(b)(1) in
petitioners' favor.  On the one hand, reading § 3731(b)(1) to exclude
retaliation actions will generally start the limitations period running when the
cause of action accrues. If § 3731(b)(1) excludes retaliation actions, then no
express time limit applies to § 3730(h) actions, and we borrow the most closely
analogous state time limit absent an expressly applicable one.  See supra, at
414 -415, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 398.  The likely analogous state statutes of
limitations virtually all start to run when the cause of action accrues--in
retaliation actions, when the retaliatory action occurs. 3

 [**2452]  [*420]    The interpretation favored by Wilson  [***402]  and the
Government, on the other hand, is in tension with this rule of construction.
Under their reading, the statute of limitations  [*421]  for FCA retaliation
actions begins to run, at best, on the date the actual or suspected FCA
violation occurred.  Because that date will precede the retaliatory conduct,
their reading starts the time limit running before the retaliation action
accrues. Even more oddly, their reading allows a retaliation action to be time
barred before it ever accrues--for example, if the employer discovers more than
six years after the suspected violation of § 3729 that an employee aided in
investigating that fraud, then retaliates.  As we have discussed, § 3731(b)(1)'s
text permits a construction that avoids these counterintuitive results--that
""civil action under section 3730"" means only those civil actions under § 3730
that  [*422]  have as an element a ""violation of section 3729,"" that is, §§
3730(a) and (b) actions.

Granted, other textual evidence cuts against this reading of § 3731(b)(1).  In
particular, Congress used the phrase ""brought under subsection  [***403]  (a) or
(b) of section 3730"" in § 3731(d); this, it is argued, shows that Congress could
have [**2453]  been similarly precise in § 3731(b)(1) if it wished.  In the
context of this statute, however, that argument proves too much, since the same
could be said of § 3731(c), which all agree uses the phrase ""action under
section 3730"" in more limited, and less precise, fashion.  See supra, at
417-418, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 400.  We do not doubt that Congress could have
drafted § 3731(b)(1) with more precision than it did, but the presence of the
same inexact wording in § 3731(c) means that the more precise language in §
3731(d) casts little doubt on our reading of the statute.

 [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]  For the reasons we have discussed,  [HN9] the
FCA's express limitations period does not apply to § 3730(h) actions.  The most
closely analogous state statute of limitations therefore applies.  Judge
Wilkinson, in his dissenting opinion below, concluded that the most closely
analogous state statute of limitations in this case is North Carolina's 3-year
statute of limitations governing wrongful-discharge claims.  See 367 F.3d at
261-262.  The appropriate state statute of limitations to borrow, however, is
not within the scope of the question we granted certiorari to decide, and the
Court of Appeals did not pass on the point.  We therefore leave that issue for
remand.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is
remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

DISSENT BY: BREYER

DISSENT

 [*423]  Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, dissenting.

As the Court points out, it is unusual to find a statute of limitations keyed
not to the time of the plaintiff's injury, but to other related events.  Still,
I believe that Congress has written such a statute here, and we should respect
its decision.

The language of the statute, 31 U.S.C. § 3731(b)(1), is reasonably clear.  It
says that ""[a] civil action under section 3730 may not be brought . . . more
than 6 years after the date on which the violation"" of federal false claims law
""is committed."" (Emphasis added.) Section 3730 lists three kinds of civil
actions, including a retaliation action under § 3730(h).  Thus, a retaliation
action is a ""civil action under section 3730,"" and § 3731(b)(1)'s 6-year
limitations period applies.

The Court tries to overcome the force of this syllogism with the help of two
textual arguments.  First, it points to the subsection that follows § 3731(b) --
§ 3731(c) --which says that ""'[i]n any action brought under section 3730, the
United States shall be required to prove all essential elements of the cause of
action, including damages, by a preponderance of the evidence.'"" See ante, at
418, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 400.  The Court then reasons that, read in context, the
phrase ""action brought under section  [***404]  3730"" could not refer to all the
civil actions listed under § 3730, for the United States is not ordinarily a
party to private retaliation suits brought under § 3730(h).  Ibid. Rather, the
phrase ""action brought under section 3730"" must refer only to the false claims
actions listed in §§ 3730(a) and (b).  Ibid. Thus, according to the Court, if in
§ 3731(c), the phrase ""action brought under section 3730"" refers only to a
subset of the actions listed under § 3730, one can read the similar phrase in §
3731(b)(1) to contain a similar limitation.  Ibid.

the properties are located has been provided by the State of New York and its
county and municipal units.  In  County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N.
Y., 470 U.S. 226, 84 L. Ed. 2d 169, 105 S. Ct. 1245 (1985) (Oneida II), this
Court held that the Oneidas  [***394]  stated a triable claim for damages
against the County of Oneida for wrongful possession of lands they conveyed to
New York State in 1795 in violation of federal law.  In the instant action, OIN
resists the payment of property taxes to Sherrill on the ground that OIN's
acquisition of fee title to discrete parcels of historic reservation land
revived the Oneidas' ancient sovereignty piecemeal over each parcel.
Consequently, the Tribe maintains, regulatory authority over OIN's newly
purchased properties no longer resides in Sherrill.

Our 1985 decision recognized that the Oneidas could maintain a federal
common-law claim for damages for ancient wrongdoing in which both national and
state governments were complicit.  Today, we decline to project redress for the
Tribe into the present and future, thereby disrupting the governance of central
New York's counties and towns.  Generations have passed during which non-Indians
have owned and developed the area that once composed the Tribe's historic
reservation. And at least since the middle years of the 19th century, most of
the Oneidas have resided elsewhere.  Given the longstanding, distinctly
non-Indian character of the area and its inhabitants, the regulatory authority
constantly exercised by New York State and its counties and towns, and the
Oneidas' long delay in seeking judicial relief against parties other than the
United States, we hold that  [*203]  the Tribe cannot unilaterally revive its
ancient sovereignty, in whole or in part, over the parcels at issue.  The
Oneidas long ago relinquished the reins of government and cannot regain them
through open-market purchases from current titleholders.

OIN is a federally recognized Indian Tribe and a direct descendant of the Oneida
Indian Nation (Oneida Nation), ""one of the six nations of the Iroquois, the most
powerful Indian Tribe in the Northeast at the time of the American Revolution.""

pressure, in 1788, New York State and the Oneida Nation entered into the Treaty
of Fort Schuyler.  For payments in money and kind, the Oneidas ceded to New York
""all their lands."" App. to Pet. for Cert. A136.  Of the vast area conveyed,

 The Federal Government initially pursued a policy protective of the New York
Indians, undertaking to secure the Tribes' rights to reserved lands.  See
Oneida II, 470 U.S., at 231-232;  Oneida I, 414 U.S., at 667, 39 L. Ed. 2d 73,
94 S. Ct. 772; F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 418-419 (1942 ed.); F.
Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 73-74 (1982 ed.) (hereinafter Handbook).
In 1790, Congress passed the first Indian Trade and Intercourse Act , commonly
known as the Nonintercourse Act. Act of July 22, 1790, ch. 33, 1 Stat. 137.
Periodically renewed, see  Oneida I, 414 U.S., at 667-668, 39 L. Ed. 2d 73, 94
S. Ct. 772, and remaining substantially in force today, see Rev Stat § 2116,
[HN1] 25 U.S.C. § 177 [25 USCS § 177], the Act bars sales of tribal land without
the acquiescence of the Federal Government. 2 In 1794, in further pursuit of its
protective policy, the United States entered into the Treaty of Canandaigua with
the Six (Iroquois) Nations.  Act of Nov. 11, 1794, 7 Stat. 44 .  That treaty
both ""acknowledge[d]"" the Oneida Reservation as established by  [*205]  the
Treaty of Fort Schuyler and guaranteed the Oneidas' ""free use and enjoyment"" of
the reserved territory. Id., at 45, Art.II  .  The Oneidas in turn agreed they
would ""never claim any other lands within the boundaries of the United States.""

2 By its terms, the 1790 Nonintercourse Act governed Indian lands within the
boundaries of the original 13 States.  The Act provided ""[t]hat no sale of lands
made by any Indians, or any nation or tribe of Indians within the United States,
shall be valid to any person or persons, or to any state, whether having the
right of pre-emption to such lands or not, unless the same shall be made and
duly executed at some public treaty, held under the authority of the United
States."" Act of July 22, 1790, ch. 33, § 4, 1 Stat. 138 (emphasis added).  Our

 New York State nonetheless continued to purchase reservation land from the
Oneidas.  The Washington administration objected to New York's 1795 negotiations
to buy 100,000 acres of the Oneidas' Reservation without federal supervision.
Oneida II, 470 U.S., at 229, 232, 84 L. Ed. 2d 169, 105 S. Ct. 1245.  Later
administrations, however, ""[made not] even a pretense of interfer[ing] with
[the] State's attempts to negotiate treaties [with the Oneidas] for land
cessions."" Oneida Nation of N. Y. v United States, 43 Ind. Cl. Comm'n 373, 385
(1978); see also id., at 390; Campisi, The Oneida Treaty Period, 1783-1838, in
The Oneida Indian Experience: Two Perspectives 48, 59 (J. Campisi & L. Hauptman
eds. 1988) (hereinafter [**1485]  Campisi).  See  [***396]  generally Gunther 6
(""New York acquired much land from Indians through treaties--perhaps as many as
200--not participated in, though apparently known and not objected to, by the
national government."" (footnote omitted)).

The Federal Government's policy soon veered away from protection of New York and
other east coast reservations. In lieu of the commitment made in the Treaty of
Canandaigua, the United States pursued a policy designed to open reservation
lands to white settlers and to remove tribes westward.  D. Getches, C.
Wilkinson, & R. Williams, Cases and Materials on Federal Indian Law 94 (4th ed.
1998) (After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, federal policymakers ""began to
debate the tactics of inducing [eastern Indians] to exchange their remaining
ancestral lands for a permanent territory in the West."").  As recounted by the
Indian Claims Commission in 1978, early 19th-century federal Indian agents in
New York State did not simply fail to check New York's land purchases, they
""took an active role . . . in encouraging the removal of the Oneidas . . . to
the west.""  [*206]  Oneida Nation of N. Y., 43 Ind. Cl. Comm'n, at 390; see id.,
at 391 (noting that some federal agents were ""deeply involved"" in ""plans . . .
to bring about the removal of the [Oneidas]"" and in the State's acquisition of
Oneida land).  Beginning in 1817, the Federal Government accelerated its efforts
to remove Indian tribes from their east coast homelands.  Handbook 78-79, and n
142.

Pressured by the removal policy to leave their ancestral lands in New York, some
150 Oneidas, by 1825, had moved to Wisconsin.  Horsman, The Wisconsin Oneidas in
the Preallotment Years, in The Oneida Indian Experience, supra, at 65, 67.  In
1838, the Oneidas and the United States entered into the Treaty of Buffalo
Creek, which envisioned removal of all remaining New York Indians, including the
Oneidas, to Kansas.  Act of Jan. 15, 1838, 7 Stat. 550 .  By this time, the
Oneidas had sold all but 5,000 acres of their original reservation.  337 F.3d
139, 149 (CA2 2003).  Six hundred of their members resided in Wisconsin, while
620 remained in New York State.  7 Stat. 556  (Sched. A).

In Article 13 of the Buffalo Creek Treaty, the Oneidas agreed to remove to the
Kansas lands the United States had set aside for them ""as soon as they c[ould]
make satisfactory arrangements"" for New York State's ""purchase of their lands at
Oneida."" Id., at 554.  As a condition of the treaty's ratification, the Senate
directed that a federal commissioner ""fully and fairly explai[n]"" the terms to
each signatory tribe and band.   New York Indians v. United States, 170 U.S. 1,
21-22, 42 L. Ed. 927, 18 S. Ct. 531, 33 Ct. Cl. 510 (1898).  Commissioner Ransom
H. Gillet, who had originally negotiated the treaty terms with the Oneidas, met
with them again and assured them they would not be forced to move but could
remain on ""their lands where they reside,"" i.e., they could ""if they ch[ose] to
do so remain where they are forever."" App 146 (emphases added).

The Oneidas who stayed on in New York after the proclamation of the Buffalo
Creek Treaty continued to diminish in number and, during the 1840's, sold most
of their remaining  [*207]  lands to the State.   New York Indians v. United
States, 40 Ct. Cl. 448, 458, 469-471 (1905).  A few hundred Oneidas moved to
Canada in 1842,  id., at  [***397]  458, and ""by the mid-1840s, only about 200
Oneidas remained in New York State,"" Introduction to Part I, The Oneida Indian
Journey: From New York to Wisconsin, 1784-1860, pp 9, 13 (L. Hauptman & L.
McLester eds. 1999).  By 1843, the New York Oneidas retained less than 1,000
acres in the State.  Campisi 61.  That acreage dwindled [**1486]  to 350 in
1890; ultimately, by 1920, only 32 acres continued to be held by the Oneidas.
Ibid.

The United States eventually abandoned its efforts to remove the New York
Indians to Kansas.  In 1860, the Federal Government restored the Kansas lands to
the public domain, and sold them thereafter.   New York Indians, 170 U.S., at
24, 28-29, 31, 42 L. Ed. 927, 18 S. Ct. 531.

B

Early litigation concerning the Oneidas' land claims trained on monetary
recompense from the United States for past deprivations.  In 1893, the United
States agreed to be sued for disposing of the Kansas lands to settlers, and the
Oneidas in New York shared in the resulting award of damages.  See  New York
Indians, 170 U.S. 1, 42 L. Ed. 927, 18 S. Ct. 531, 33 Ct. Cl. 510;  New York
Indians, 40 Ct. Cl. 448 (identifying the Tribes qualified to share in the
distribution of the sum recovered).

Seeking further compensation from the United States a half century later, the
New York and Wisconsin Oneidas initiated proceedings before the Indian Claims
Commission in 1951.   Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y. v. County of Oneida, 622
F.2d 624, 626 (CA2 1980).  They sought redress for lands New York had acquired
through 25 treaties of cession concluded between 1795 and 1846.  The Oneidas
alleged, and the Claims Commission agreed, that under the Nonintercourse Act of
1790 and successor statutes, the Federal Government had a fiduciary duty to
ensure that the Oneidas received from New York ""conscionable consideration"" for
the lands in question.  Oneida Nation of N. Y. v United States,  [*208]  26 Ind.
Cl. Comm'n 138, 145 (1971).  The Court of Claims affirmed the Commission's core
determination, but held that the United States' duty extended only to land
transactions of which the Government had knowledge.   United States v. Oneida
Nation of N. Y., 201 Ct. Cl. 546, 554, 477 F.2d 939, 944 (1973).  Accordingly,
the Court of Claims directed the Commission to determine whether the Government
actually or constructively knew of the land transactions at issue.   Id., at
555, 477 F.2d at 945.

On remand, the Commission found that the Federal Government had actual or
constructive knowledge of all of the treaties and would be liable if the Oneidas
had not received conscionable consideration.  Oneida Nation of N. Y., 43 Ind.
Cl. Comm'n, at 375, 406-407.  The Commission anticipated further proceedings to
determine the Federal Government's ultimate liability, but the Oneidas had by
then decided to pursue a different course.  On the Oneidas' request, the Court
of Claims dismissed the proceedings.  See  Oneida Nation of N. Y. v. United
States, 231 Ct. Cl. 990, 991 (1982) (per curiam).

In lieu of concentrating on recovery from the United States, the Oneidas pursued
suits against local governments.  In 1970, the Oneidas of New York and
Wisconsin, asserting federal-question jurisdiction under 28 USC §§ 1331 or 1362
[28 USCS §§ 1331 or§ 1362, instituted a ""test  [***398]  case"" against the New
York Counties of Oneida and Madison.  They alleged that the cession of 100,000
acres to New York State in 1795, see supra, at 205, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 395,
violated the Nonintercourse Act and thus did not terminate the Oneidas' right to
possession under the applicable federal treaties and statutes.  In this initial
endeavor to gain compensation from governmental units other than the United
States, the Oneidas confined their demand for relief.  They sought only damages
measured by the fair rental value, for the years 1968 and 1969, of 872 acres of
their ancestral land owned and occupied by the two counties.  The District
Court, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, dismissed [**1487]  the Oneidas'
[*209]  complaint for failure to state a claim arising under federal law.  We
reversed that determination, holding that federal jurisdiction was properly
invoked.   Oneida I, 414 U.S., at 675, 682, 39 L. Ed. 2d 73, 94 S. Ct. 772.

In the next round, the Oneidas prevailed in the lower courts.  On review in
Oneida II, we rejected various defenses the counties presented that might have
barred the action for damages,  470 U.S., at 240-250, 84 L. Ed. 2d 169, 105 S.
Ct. 1245, and held that the Oneidas could maintain their claim to be compensated
""for violation of their possessory rights based on federal common law,""  id., at
236, 84 L. Ed. 2d 169, 105 S. Ct. 1245.  While upholding the judgment of the
Court of Appeals regarding the counties' liability under federal common law, we
noted that ""[t]he question whether equitable considerations should limit the
relief available to the present day Oneida Indians was not addressed by the
Court of Appeals or presented to this Court.""  Id., at 253, n. 27, 84 L. Ed. 2d
169, 105 S. Ct. 1245.  Accordingly, ""we express[ed] no opinion as to whether
other considerations m[ight] be relevant to the final disposition of this case.""
Ibid. On remand, the District Court entered a final judgment which fixed the
amount of damages payable by the counties.  Allowing setoffs for the counties'
good-faith improvements to the land, the court ordered recoveries of $15,994
from Oneida County and $18,970 from Madison County, plus prejudgment interest.
Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y. v. County of Oneida, 217 F. Supp. 2d 292, 310
(NDNY 2002).

In 2000, litigation resumed in an action held in abeyance during the pendency of
the test case.  In that revitalized action, the Oneidas sought damages from
Oneida and Madison Counties for a period spanning over 200 years.  The amended
complaint alleged that, through a series of agreements concluded during the
years 1795 to 1846, approximately 250,000 acres of the Oneidas' ancestral land
had been unlawfully conveyed to New York.   Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y. v.
County of Oneida, 199 F.R.D. 61, 66-68 (NDNY 2000).

[*210]  The Oneidas further sought to enlarge the action by demanding recovery
of land they had not occupied since the 1795-1846 conveyances. 3 They attempted
to join as  [***399]  defendants, inter alia, approximately 20,000 private
landowners, and to obtain declaratory relief that would allow the Oneidas to
eject these landowners.  Id., at 67-68. 4 The District Court refused permission
to join the landowners so late in the day, resting in part on the Oneidas' bad
faith and undue delay.   Id., at 79-85.  [**1488]  Further, the court found the
proposed amendment ""futile.""  Id., at 94.  In this regard, the court emphasized
the ""sharp distinction between the existence of a federal common law right to
Indian homelands,"" a right this Court recognized in Oneida II, ""and how to
vindicate that right.""  199 F.R.D. , at 90.  That distinction ""must be drawn,""
the court stated, ibid., for in the two centuries since the alleged wrong,
""development of every type imaginable  [*211]  has been ongoing,""  id., at 92.
Referring to the ""practical concerns"" that blocked restoration of Indians to
their former lands, the court found it high time ""to transcend the theoretical.""
Ibid. Cases of this genre, the court observed, ""cr[ied] out for a pragmatic
approach."" Ibid. The District Court therefore excluded the imposition of any
liability against private landowners.  Id., at 93-95.

3 In contrast,  United States v. Boylan, 265 F. 165 (CA2 1920), involved land
the Oneidas never left.  Boylan concerned the 1885 conveyances by individual
Oneida Indians of a 32-acre tract of reservation land to non-Indians.  Despite
the conveyances, a band of Oneidas continued to live on the land.  After a
non-Indian gained a state-court order ejecting the remaining Oneidas, the United
States brought suit on behalf of the Oneidas to reclaim the land.  The Second
Circuit observed that the Oneidas were ""actually in possession"" of the 32 acres
in question,  id., at 167, and had occupied the land continuously for over a
century,  id., at 171.  Given that occupation and the absence of Federal
Government approval for the individual Oneidas' conveyances, the Second Circuit
upheld the District Court's ""decree restoring the ejected Indians to
possession.""  Id., at 173-174.

4 In another lawsuit, commenced in 1978, the Oneidas sought from the State of
New York and others both damages and recovery of land New York had purchased
from the Oneidas in 1785 and 1788.   Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 860 F.2d at
1148.  The Second Circuit affirmed the District Court's dismissal of that
action, holding that treaties between New York and the Oneidas during the years
in which the Articles of Confederation were operative did not require the assent
of Congress.   Id., at 1167; see supra, at 203-204, n 1, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at
394-395.

This brings us to the present case, which concerns parcels of land in the city
of Sherrill, located in Oneida County, New York.  According to the 2000 census,
over 99% of the population in the area is non-Indian: American Indians represent
less than 1% of the city of Sherrill's population and less than 0.5% of Oneida
County's population.  U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, 2000 Census of
Population and Housing, Summary Population and Housing Characteristics: New
York, 2000 PHC-1-34, Table 3, p 124 (July 2002), available at
http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/phc-1-34.pdf (as visited Mar. 24, 2005, and
available in Clerk of Court's case file).  OIN owns approximately 17,000 acres
of land scattered throughout the Counties of Oneida and Madison, representing
less than 1.5% of the counties' total area.  OIN's predecessor, the Oneida
Nation, had transferred the parcels at issue to one of its members in 1805, who
sold the land to a non-Indian in 1807.  The properties thereafter remained in
non-Indian hands until OIN's acquisitions in 1997 and 1998 in open-market
transactions.  See  337 F.3d at 144, n. 3.  OIN now operates commercial
enterprises on these parcels: a gasoline station, a convenience store, and a
textile facility.   Id., at 144.

Because the parcels lie within the boundaries of the reservation originally
occupied by the Oneidas, OIN maintained that the properties are exempt from
taxation, and accordingly refused to pay the assessed property taxes.  The city
of Sherrill  [***400]  initiated eviction proceedings in state court, and OIN
sued Sherrill in federal court.  In contrast to Oneida I  [*212]  and II, which
involved demands for monetary compensation, OIN sought equitable relief
prohibiting, currently and in the future, the imposition of property taxes.  OIN
also sued Madison County, seeking a declaration that the Tribe's properties in
Madison are tax exempt.  The litigation involved a welter of claims and
counterclaims.  Relevant here, the District Court concluded that parcels of land
owned by the Tribe in Sherrill and Madison are not taxable.  See  145 F. Supp.
2d 226, 254-259 (NDNY 2001).

A divided panel of the Second Circuit affirmed.   337 F.3d 139.  Writing for the
majority, Judge Parker ruled that the parcels qualify as ""Indian country,"" as
that term is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1151 [18 USCS § 1151], 5 because they fall
within the boundaries of a reservation set aside by the 1794 Canandaigua Treaty
for Indian use under federal supervision.   337 F.3d, at 155-156; see supra, at
204-205, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 395.  The court further held that the Buffalo Creek
Treaty did not demonstrate a clear congressional purpose to  [**1489]
disestablish or diminish the Oneida Reservation.  337 F.3d, at 161, 165; see
supra, at 206, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 396.  Finally, the court found no legal
requirement ""that a federally recognized tribe demonstrate its continuous
existence in order to assert a claim to its reservation land.""  337 F.3d, at
165. In any case, the court held, the record demonstrated OIN's continuous
tribal existence.   Id., at 166-167.  Judge Van Graafeiland dissented as to the
majority's primary holding.  In his view, the record raised a substantial
question whether OIN had ""forfeited"" its aboriginal rights to the land because
it abandoned ""its tribal existence . . . for a discernable period of time.""  Id.
, at 171.

[***LEdHR1A] [1B] OIN and the United States argue that because the Court in
Oneida II recognized the Oneidas' aboriginal title to their ancient reservation
land and because the Tribe has now acquired the specific parcels involved in
this suit in the open market, it has unified fee and aboriginal title and may
now assert sovereign dominion over the parcels. Brief for Respondents 1, 12-19;

 [*78]  [**2143]   Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR3A]  The State of Alaska has invoked our
original jurisdiction to resolve its dispute with the United States over title
to certain submerged lands underlying waters located in southeast Alaska.
Alaska initiated the action by filing a complaint with leave of the Court.   530
U.S. 1228, 147 L. Ed. 2d 272, 120 S. Ct. 2681 (2000).  We appointed Professor

report he now recommends the grant of summary judgment to the United States with
respect to all the submerged lands in dispute.  Report of Special Master 1

discuss, Alaska's exceptions are overruled.

I

[***LEdHR4] [4]  [***LEdHR5] [5]  [***LEdHR6A]  We begin by reviewing the
general principles elaborated in the resolution of similar submerged lands
disputes in our earlier cases.

[HN1] States enjoy a presumption of title to submerged lands beneath inland
navigable waters within their boundaries and  [*79]  beneath territorial waters
within three nautical miles of their coasts. This presumption flows from two
sources.  Under the established rule known as the equal footing doctrine, new
States enter the Union ""on an 'equal footing' with the original 13 Colonies and
succeed to the United States' title to the beds of navigable waters within their
boundaries.""  United States v. Alaska, 521 U.S. 1, 5, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S.
Ct. 1888 (1997) (Alaska (Arctic Coast)). Under the Submerged Lands Act (SLA), 67
Stat. 29, 43 U.S.C. § 1301 et seq., which applies to Alaska through an express
provision of the Alaska Statehood Act (ASA), § 6(m), 72 Stat. 343, the
presumption of state title to ""lands beneath navigable waters within the
boundaries of [**2144]  the respective States"" is ""confirmed"" and ""established.""
43 U.S.C. § 1311(a); see also  Alaska (Arctic Coast), 521 U.S., at 5-6, 138 L.
Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888.  The SLA also ""establishes States' title to
submerged lands beneath a 3-mile belt of the territorial sea, which would
otherwise be held by the United States.""  Id., at 6, 138 L. Ed. 231, 117 S. Ct.
1888.  ""As a general matter, then, Alaska is entitled under both the equal
footing doctrine and the Submerged Lands Act to submerged lands beneath tidal
and inland navigable waters, and under  [***69]  the Submerged Lands Act alone
to submerged lands extending three miles seaward of its coastline."" Ibid.

[***LEdHR6A]  The Federal Government can overcome the presumption and defeat a
future State's title to submerged lands by setting them aside before statehood
in a way that shows an intent to retain title.   Id., at 33-34, 138 L. Ed. 2d
231, 117 S. Ct. 1888.  The requisite intent must, however, be ""'definitely
declared or otherwise made very plain.'""  Id., at 34, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S.
Ct. 1888 (quoting  United States v. Holt State Bank, 270 U.S. 49, 55, 70 L. Ed.
465, 46 S. Ct. 197 (1926)).

With these principles in mind, we discuss the two areas of submerged land at
issue here.

II

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR7A]   [***LEdHR8A]  The first area of submerged land in
dispute, claimed by Alaska under alternative theories in counts I and II of its
[*80]  amended complaint to quiet title (hereinafter Amended Complaint),
consists of pockets and enclaves of submerged lands underlying waters in between
and fringing the southeastern Alaska islands known as the Alexander Archipelago.
These disputed submerged lands, shown in red and dark blue on the map in
Appendix A, infra, share a common feature: All points within the pockets and
enclaves are more than three nautical miles from the coast of the mainland or of
any individual island of the Alexander Archipelago.

For these pockets and enclaves, the dispositive question is whether the
Alexander Archipelago's waters qualify as inland waters. If they do, Alaska's
coastline would begin at the outer bounds of these inland waters as marked by
the black line drawn on the map in Appendix A, infra. See 43 U.S.C. § 1301(c)
[HN2] (""The term 'coast line' means the line of ordinary low water along that
portion of the coast which is in direct contact with the open sea and the line
marking the seaward limit of inland waters""); see also  United States v. Alaska,
422 U.S. 184, 187-188, 45 L. Ed. 2d 109, 95 S. Ct. 2240, and n. 5 (1975) (Alaska
(Cook Inlet)). Under the equal footing doctrine and the SLA, a presumption of
state title would then arise as to all the submerged lands underlying both the
inland waters landward of this coastline, and also the territorial sea within
three nautical miles of it.  Because the United States concedes it could not
rebut the presumption of state title as to this aspect of the case, Alaska would
have title to all the pockets and enclaves of submerged lands in dispute.

If the Alexander Archipelago's waters do not qualify as inland, then they
instead qualify as territorial sea. In that case Alaska would have no claim of
title to the disputed pockets and enclaves, as these lands are beyond three
nautical miles from the coast of the mainland or any individual island.

[***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR9A]  The second area of submerged land in dispute,
claimed by Alaska in count IV of its Amended Complaint, consists of the
submerged land beneath Glacier Bay, a well-marked indentation into the coast of
the southeast Alaskan mainland. See  [*81]  Appendixes C, D, infra (maps of
Glacier Bay).  There is no question that Glacier Bay's waters are inland. For
the submerged [**2145]  lands underlying these waters, the controlling question
is whether the United States  [***70]  can rebut Alaska's presumption of title.

[***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR3A]   [***LEdHR7A]   [***LEdHR8A]  After receiving the
parties' written submissions and conducting a hearing, the Special Master
recommended that this Court grant summary judgment to the United States with
respect to Alaska's claims of title to both areas of submerged land in dispute.
Report 1.  As to the pockets and enclaves, the Special Master concluded that the
waters of the Alexander Archipelago do not qualify as inland waters either under
the historic inland waters theory advanced in count I of Alaska's Amended
Complaint or under the juridical bay theory advanced in count II.  Id., at
137-138, 226.  As to the submerged lands underlying Glacier Bay and claimed by
Alaska in count IV, the Special Master concluded that the United States has
rebutted the presumption that title passed to Alaska at statehood. Id., at 276.
Alaska filed exceptions to each of these three conclusions.  We address them in
turn.

III

[***LEdHR7A]   [***LEdHR10A]  In count I of its Amended Complaint, Alaska
alleges that the waters of the Alexander Archipelago are historic inland waters.
As this Court has recognized,  [HN3] ""where a State within the United States
wishes to claim submerged lands based on an area's status as historic inland
waters, the State must demonstrate that the United States:  (1) exercises
authority over the area; (2) has done so continuously; and (3) has done so with
the acquiescence of foreign nations.""  Alaska (Arctic Coast), 521 U.S., at 11,
138 L. Ed. 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888.  ""For this showing,"" we have elaborated, ""the
exercise of sovereignty must have been, historically, an assertion of power to
exclude all foreign vessels and navigation.""  Alaska (Cook Inlet), supra, at
197, 45 L. Ed. 109, 95 S. Ct. 2240.

[HN4]  [***LEdHR10A]  Nations may exclude from inland waters even vessels
engaged in so-called ""innocent passage""--passage that ""is not  [*82]
prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State,"" Arts.
14(1), 14(4) of the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone,
Apr. 29, 1958, [1964] 15 U. S. T. 1607, 1610 T. I. A. S. No. 5639 (hereinafter
Convention).  See  United States v. Louisiana, 470 U.S. 93, 113, 84 L. Ed. 2d
73, 105 S. Ct. 1074 (1985) (Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case); United
States v. Louisiana, 394 U.S. 11, 22, 22 L. Ed. 2d 44, 89 S. Ct. 773 (1969).  To
claim a body of water as historic inland water, it is therefore important to
establish that the right to exclude innocent passage has somehow been asserted,
even if never actually exercised.  See  Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case,
470 U.S., at 113, 84 L. Ed. 2d 73, 105 S. Ct. 1074.  The Court also has
considered the ""vital interests of the United States"" in designating waters as
historic inland waters.  Id., at 103, 84 L. Ed. 2d 73, 105 S. Ct. 1074.

[***LEdHR7A]  The Special Master recommended that the Court grant summary
judgment to the United States on this count.  The Special Master first made a
thorough examination of historical documents, from 1821 to the present, bearing
on the status of the Alexander Archipelago's waters. The Special Master sorted
these documents into five distinct periods: (1) Russian sovereignty (1821-1867),
Report 23-38; (2) early American sovereignty (1867-1903), id., at 38-55; (3) the
1903 US-Britain Boundary  [***71]  Arbitration, id., at 56-63; (4) later
American sovereignty (1903-1959), id., at 63-89; and (5) the poststatehood era
(1959-present), id., at 89-107.  Based on his examination of the record evidence
from all of these periods, the Special Master concluded that ""Russia and the
United States [**2146]  historically did not assert authority to exclude vessels
from making innocent passage through the waters of the Alexander Archipelago.""
Id., at 109.  In the Special Master's view, Alaska had at best ""uncovered and
presented only 'questionable evidence' that the United States exercised the kind
of authority over the waters of the Archipelago that would be necessary to prove
a historic waters claim."" Id., at 129.

[*83]  Though Alaska's failure to demonstrate that the waters of the Alexander
Archipelago had historically been treated as inland waters would by itself
justify granting summary judgment to the United States on count I, the Special
Master also addressed other relevant factors, such as the acquiescence of other
nations and the vital interests of the United States.  In the Special Master's
view these factors only strengthened the case for granting summary judgment to
the United States.

Excepting to the Special Master's recommendation on count I, Alaska contends the
Special Master gave too little weight to historical events that tend to support
Alaska's position.  By the same token Alaska argues the Special Master gave too
much weight to historical events that tend to undermine its position.  Alaska
also asserts that foreign nations have acquiesced in the treatment of the waters
of the Alexander Archipelago as inland waters, and that the interests of the
United States support such treatment.  We find Alaska's arguments unconvincing.

Rather than canvassing the entire historical record discussed by the Special
Master in his thorough, commendable report, we turn our attention to the events
Alaska presents as its best evidence that the Alexander Archipelago's waters
qualify as historic inland waters.

A

[***LEdHR7A]   [***LEdHR11] [11] First in time among the events to which Alaska
points are incidents from the period of Russian sovereignty.  These incidents
are pertinent to the inquiry because, as we have held, when Russia ceded the
territory of Alaska to the United States in 1867, ""the United States thereby
acquired whatever dominion Russia had possessed.""  Alaska (Cook Inlet), 422
U.S., at 192, n. 13, 45 L. Ed. 109, 95 S. Ct. 2240.

[***LEdHR7A]  In 1824, the United States and Russia entered into a treaty that,
inter alia, granted United States vessels the right, over  [*84]  the next 10
years, to ""frequent, without any hindrance whatever, the interior seas, gulphs,
harbours, and creeks [of the Alexander Archipelago], for the purpose of fishing
and trading with the natives of the country."" See Convention Between the United
States of America and Russia, Art. 4, 8 Stat. 304 (1825) (hereinafter 1824
Treaty or Treaty).  In Alaska's view this Treaty demonstrates that ""the Russian
claim extended to the entire Archipelago"" and thus that Russia treated the
archipelago waters as inland waters. Exceptions to Report of Special Master and
Brief in Support for Plaintiff 29 (hereinafter Exceptions and Brief for
Plaintiff Alaska).  The principal problem with Alaska's assertion is that the
1824  [***72]  Treaty by its terms did not address navigation for the purpose of
innocent passage, but rather addressed only navigation ""for the purpose of
fishing and trading with the natives."" Even on the questionable assumption that
the Treaty's reference to ""interior seas"" included all the waters of the
Alexander Archipelago and not just waters within three nautical miles of the
coast of the mainland or any particular island, but see Report 27-28 (refuting
this assumption), the Treaty simply does not provide evidence that Russia
asserted a right to exclude innocent passage.  Yet evidence of the assertion of
this right--not some lesser right--must be provided [**2147]  to support an
historic inland waters claim.  See  Alaska (Cook Inlet), supra, at 197, 45 L.
Ed. 2d 109, 95 S. Ct. 2240.

Upon the expiration of the 10-year right granted to United States vessels by
virtue of the 1824 Treaty, Russia stationed a brig, the Chichagoff, at the
southern border of Russian America.  Alaska implies that Russia's purpose in
stationing the brig there was to exclude any foreign vessels from entering the
Alexander Archipelago's waters. See Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska
30-31.  Were we to accept this interpretation of the Chichagoff incident, we
would acknowledge it as some evidence that Russia treated the Alexander
Archipelago's waters as inland waters.

[*85]  As the Special Master noted, however, a report prepared for the 1903
Alaskan Boundary Tribunal (a tribunal we will discuss further) described the
Chichagoff incident as follows:


     ""Governor Wrangell sent the brig Chichagoff, under command of
     Lieutenant Zarembo, to Tongas, near the southern boundary line at
     54degree 40ft, for the purpose of intercepting foreign vessels
     entering the inland waters of the colony, to the masters of which he
     was to deliver written notice of the expiration of the treaty
     provisions, being furnished with six copies for American and three for
     British vessels."" 1 Proceedings of the Alaskan Boundary Tribunal, S.
     Doc. No. 162, 58th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, p 70 (1904) (hereinafter
     ABT proceedings) (footnote omitted).



Like the Special Master, we see nothing in this passage to indicate that Russia,
through its actions with respect to the Chichagoff, asserted a right to exclude
from the Alexander Archipelago waters foreign vessels engaged only in innocent
passage.  By giving written notice of the expiration of the 1824 Treaty rights,
the Chichagoff reminded American mariners that they were no longer free to trade
with the natives, or to approach within cannon shot of the Russian lands
""without any hindrance whatever."" 1824 Treaty, Art. 4, 8 Stat. 304.  Russia did
not assert thereby the more sweeping right to exclude even vessels engaged only
in innocent passage.

Alaska also points to evidence that in 1836 Russian forces apprehended and
boarded the American vessel Loriot while it was within the Alexander Archipelago
waters, and then ordered it ""'to leave the waters of His Imperial Majesty.'""
Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 30; see also Letter from John Forsyth
to G. M. Dallas (May 4, 1837), reprinted in Report of Secretary of State Thomas
F. Bayard upon the Seal Fisheries in the Bering Sea, S. Exec. Doc. No. 106, 50th
Cong., 2d Sess., 232-233 (1889).  Even this incident does  [***73]  not  [*86]
constitute evidence that Russia viewed the archipelago waters as inland waters,
however, because the Loriot was not engaged in innocent passage.  The Loriot's
mission, as freely admitted in a contemporary letter written by a State
Department official to a member of the United States legation in St. Petersburg,
was to visit ""the northwest coast of America, for the purpose of procuring
provisions, and also Indians to hunt for sea otter on the said coast."" Id., at
232.  By excluding the Loriot, which evidently had tried to exceed the limits of
mere ""innocent passage,"" Russia did not, and could not, assert a right to
exclude vessels engaged solely in innocent passage.

In sum, none of the incidents Alaska cites from the period of Russian
sovereignty support the proposition that Russia treated the waters of the
Alexander Archipelago as inland waters prior to ceding Alaska to the United
States in 1867.

B

For the period of early U.S. sovereignty between 1867 and 1903, Alaska cites not
a [**2148]  single incident demonstrating that the United States acted in a
manner consistent with an understanding that the Alexander Archipelago waters
were inland.  Alaska thus leaves itself with at most 56 years to demonstrate
continuous prestatehood treatment of the Alexander Archipelago as inland waters.
This alone constitutes a substantial weakness in Alaska's position.

As to the years between 1867 and 1903, Alaska does attempt to explain away a
significant event which undercuts its claim, but this attempt is unsuccessful.
In 1886, Secretary of State Thomas F. Bayard wrote a letter to Secretary of
Treasury Daniel Manning concerning the limits of the territorial waters of the
United States on both the northeastern and the northwestern coasts. See 1 J.
Moore, Digest of International Law 718-721 (1906).  The State Department's
position with respect to waters surrounding fringing islands on both coasts was
that the sovereigns of those islands could  [*87]  only claim a territorial sea
of three miles from the coast of each island. Secretary Bayard explained that,
in asserting the 3-mile belt of territorial sea, the United States denied
neither ""the free right of vessels of other nations to pass, on peaceful
errands, through this zone"" nor the right ""of relief, when suffering from want
of necessities, from the shore."" Id., at 720-721.

According to Secretary Bayard, the State Department's position was a
well-considered one, rooted in principles of reciprocity and consistent
practice:


     ""These rights we insist on being conceded to our fishermen in the
     northeast, where the mainland is under the British sceptre.  We can
     not refuse them to others on our northwest coast, where the sceptre is
     held by the United States.  We asserted them . . . against Russia,
     thus denying to her jurisdiction beyond three miles on her own
     marginal seas. We can not claim greater jurisdiction against other
     nations, of seas washing territories which we derived from Russia
     under the Alaska purchase."" Id., at 721 (internal quotation marks
     omitted).



The Special Master singled out this letter as ""unambiguously support[ing] the
United States' position that the United States and Russia historically  [***74]
did not assert the right to exclude foreign vessels from the waters of the
Archipelago."" Report 109.  Emphasizing the statements in the letter that the
United States could not ""'claim greater jurisdiction'"" than three miles of
marginal seas and that foreign vessels had the right to make ""'free transit,'""
the Special Master concluded that ""[o]fficials who held this belief could not,
and evidently did not, claim that the United States could exclude innocent
passage through the waters."" Id., at 110.

Alaska argues that Secretary Bayard's letter is of minimal relevance because ""it
was internal correspondence that primarily addressed a dispute on the East
coast"" and thus ""did not announce to any foreign nation that the United States
[*88]  had abandoned a claim to the Archipelago."" Exceptions and Brief for
Plaintiff Alaska 31-32.  Alaska's arguments are unpersuasive.  That Secretary
Bayard's letter referred to the east coast in no way diminishes the unequivocal
nature of its statements with respect to the Alaskan coast. It may be true that
no foreign nation ever became aware of Secretary Bayard's letter (though the
subsequent publication of the letter in the United States' Digest of
International Law gives us reason to believe the contrary).  Regardless,
Secretary Bayard's letter still provides strong evidence that the United States,
as of 1886, did not claim a right to exclude all foreign vessels from the
Alexander Archipelago waters and had no intention of doing so.  We do not need
to parse the letter to see whether it ""announce[d]  [**2149]  to any foreign
nation that the United States had abandoned a claim to the Archipelago,"" for
Alaska can muster no proof that the United States as of 1886 had made any such
claim in the first place.

C

A stronger piece of evidence Alaska identifies to support its historic inland
waters claim is a litigating position taken by the United States during an
arbitration proceeding in 1903.  This proceeding was before the Alaska Boundary
Tribunal, a body convened to resolve a dispute between the United States and
Britain regarding the land boundary between southeastern Alaska and Canada.
Report 56-63, 116-119.

In a written submission to the tribunal, the United States described its view of
the ""political coast"" of Alaska as enclosing all of the Alexander Archipelago
waters, as shown on the map in Appendix A, infra. 4 ABT Proceedings, pt. 1, pp
31-32 (1903).  According to the United States' submissions, ""[t]he boundary of
Alaska,--that is, the exterior boundary from which the marine league [of the
territorial sea] is measured,--runs along the outer edge of the Alaskan or
Alexander Archipelago, embracing a group composed of  [*89]  hundreds of
islands."" 5 id., pt. 1, at 15-16.  At oral argument before the tribunal,
moreover, counsel for the United States made explicit that the recognition of
such a ""political coast"" would render all waters landward of it ""just as much
interior waters as the interior waters of Loch Lomond."" 7 id., at 611 (1904).

Before the Special Master in the instant case, the United States sought to
discount as mere hypothetical statements the submissions it had made at the
tribunal a full century prior.  The Special Master rejected this view and
instead agreed  [***75]  with Alaska that in its submissions to the tribunal the
United States ""was expressing a considered analysis of the [Alexander
Archipelago] area, not merely speaking hypothetically for the purpose of showing
a flaw in Britain's argument."" Report 61.  Ultimately, however, the Special
Master still concluded that the United States' submissions to the tribunal were
""not an adequate assertion of authority over the waters of the Alexander
Archipelago."" Id., at 118.  The Special Master noted that the issue before the
1903 tribunal was not ""[t]he status of the waters of the Alexander Archipelago,""
ibid., but rather the land boundary between southeast Alaska and Canada; that
the United States' declarations regarding the status of the Alexander
Archipelago took up ""only a few paragraphs in a seven volume record""; and that
""[f]or these reasons, it would be unrealistic to conclude that counsel's
assertions at the tribunal should have made foreign nations (other than Britain)
aware that the United States was asserting a right to exclude them."" Ibid.

[***LEdHR7A]   [***LEdHR12] [12] Alaska responds that the Special Master was
incorrect to conclude that the United States' submissions in 1903 could not have
made foreign nations other than Britain aware of its claim.  Alaska argues that
Norway became aware of the United States' submissions and then relied on them in
its dispute with the United Kingdom in the well-known Fisheries Case (U. K. v.
Nor.), 1951 I. C. J. 116 (Judgment of Dec. 18).  As the Special Master
explained, however, ""[t]he ability  [*90]  of one foreign nation to discover the
United States' argument when litigating a related issue . . . does not mean that
foreign nations should have known of the United States' position."" Report 118, n
34.  This reasoning carries particular force in light of the precedent a
contrary conclusion would create.  If this Court were to recognize historic
inland waters claims based on [**2150]  arguments made by counsel during
litigation about nonmaritime boundaries, ""the United States would itself become
vulnerable to similarly weak claims by other nations that would restrict the
freedom of the seas."" Reply Brief for United States in Response to Exceptions of
the State of Alaska 15-16 (hereinafter Reply Brief for United States).  We are
reluctant to create a precedent that would have this effect.

D

[***LEdHR7A]  The litigating position taken by the United States at the ABT
Proceedings at best would provide weak support for inland status of the
Alexander Archipelago waters even were we to accept it as signaling a
significant change from the view expressed in Secretary Bayard's letter of 1886;
for there is little evidence that the United States later acted in a manner
consistent with this litigating position.  Alaska says that the United States
asserted control over the waters by enacting and enforcing fishery regulations
in the Alexander Archipelago during the first half of the 20th century.
Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 25-29.  In particular, Alaska cites
the 1906 Alien Fishing Act, 34 Stat. 263, which prohibited foreign, but not
domestic, commercial fishing ""in any of the waters of Alaska."" As its sole
evidence that the Act was enforced even in the pockets and enclaves at issue,
Alaska cites the seizure by the United States Coast Guard in 1924 of the
Canadian vessel Marguerite,  [***76]  whose captain was fined $100 for fishing
in contravention of the Act.

Assuming, arguendo, that the Marguerite was seized in one of the disputed
pockets or enclaves, a point which the Special Master found unclear, Report
67-68, this one incident  [*91]  hardly suffices to demonstrate a continuous
policy.  Indeed, contrary authority exists.  In 1934 the Departments of State
and Commerce exchanged letters expressing their shared understanding that the
United States lacked the power to enforce the Act more than three miles from the
shore of any island or the mainland. Id., at 70-71 (quoting Letter from Daniel
C. Roper, Secretary of Commerce, to Secretary of State 1 (Sept. 5,
1934)(""'Canadian fishermen may operate [in the Alexander Archipelago waters] so
long as they remain outside the three mile limit'"" ); and Letter from William
Phillips, Under Secretary of State, to Secretary of Commerce 1 (Sept. 13, 1934)
(expressing appreciation for the assurance ""'that the Fishery laws and
regulations will be enforced by the Bureau of Fisheries in conformity with the
view that Canadian fishermen may operate [in the Alexander Archipelago waters]
so long as they remain outside the three-mile limit'"".  This understanding was
inconsistent with a view of the Alexander Archipelago waters as inland. Report
70-71, 110-111.

Even were the seizure of the Marguerite taken as evidence of a right asserted by
the United States in 1924, the official correspondence cited by the Special
Master establishes that by 1934 the United States had reverted to the position
taken in Secretary Bayard's 1886 letter.  As the United States observes,
furthermore, the fact that Britain protested the seizure of the Marguerite
indicates that any claim of right implied from that seizure was not one in which
foreign nations acquiesced.  Reply Brief for United States 17, n 10.

Alaska also refers to various poststatehood events which, in its view, confirm
the status of the Alexander Archipelago waters as inland waters. We find
insufficient prestatehood evidence to establish inland waters status in the
first place, and so we find it unnecessary to discuss these further events.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR7A]  At best, Alaska's submissions before this Court
establish that the United States [**2151]  made one official statement--in the
1903 Alaska Boundary Arbitration--describing the Alexander Archipelago waters as
inland, and that the United States  [*92]  seized one foreign vessel--the
Marguerite--in a manner arguably consistent with the status of those waters as
inland. These incidents are insufficient to demonstrate the continuous assertion
of exclusive authority, with acquiescence of foreign nations, necessary to
support an historic inland waters claim.  Alaska's exception to the Special
Master's recommendation on count I of the Amended Complaint is overruled.

IV

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR8A]  In count II of its Amended Complaint, Alaska
presents an alternative theory to justify treating the Alexander Archipelago's
waters as inland. Alaska's alternative theory is that the waters of the
Alexander Archipelago in truth consist of two vast, but as yet unnoticed,
juridical bays.   [HN5] Waters within a juridical bay would be deemed inland
waters. Art. 5(1) of the Convention, 15 U. S. T., at 1609. Thus, if accepted,
Alaska's  [***77]  theory would render all the Alexander Archipelago's waters
inland waters to the extent they lie within the limits of the bays Alaska"
"             PAUL ALLEN DYE, Petitioner v. GERALD HOFBAUER, WARDEN",546 U.S. 1,"

 [*2]   [**6]  Per Curiam.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A] Tried by a jury for the third time, petitioner Paul Allen Dye
was convicted in the Recorders Court in Detroit, Michigan, on two counts of
murder and one count of possession of a firearm during commission of a felony.
His defense in each of his three trials was that the crimes were committed by
one of the prosecution's key witnesses, who was present at the scene of the
crimes.

The Michigan Court of Appeals upheld the convictions on direct review, People v.
Dye, No. 136707 (Nov. 28, 1995) (per curiam), App. to Pet. for Cert. 109, and
further review was denied by the Supreme Court of Michigan,  People v. Dye, 453
Mich. 852, 551 N. W. 2d 189 (1996).  Petitioner sought relief in habeas corpus
in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan,
alleging various federal constitutional claims.  Denied relief, petitioner
appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

Over the next five years, the Court of Appeals issued various orders and two
opinions in the case.   45 Fed. Appx. 428 (CA6 2002) (Dye I); 111 Fed. Appx. 363
(CA6 2004) (Dye II). In Dye I, a majority of a divided three-judge panel ruled
the state prosecutor had engaged in flagrant misconduct during the jury trial.
On this ground it reversed the District Court's order denying habeas relief.
The panel did not address petitioner's other claims.   45 Fed. Appx., at 428, n.
1.

Respondent moved for panel or en banc rehearing.  In the time between this
motion and its disposition one of the judges in the majority retired, and the
record was returned to the District Court.

In Dye II, a reconstituted panel granted the petition for rehearing and ruled in
favor of respondent.  In an opinion authored by the original panel's dissenting
judge, the Court of  [***4]  Appeals held that, although Dye had raised a
prosecutorial misconduct claim in state court, the record did not show that he
presented it there as a violation of a federal right. ""Because the brief filed
by the petitioner in his direct appeal to  [*3]  the Michigan Court of Appeals
is not in the record, we have no way of determining exactly how he framed the
issue in state court.""  111 Fed. Appx., at 364.  As further support for its
conclusion, the panel noted the Michigan Court of Appeals' decision analyzed the
relevant claim only in terms of state law.  The panel concluded, moreover, it
would decline to address the claim even if Dye had properly raised it in state
court because the federal habeas corpus petition's allegations were too vague
and general to be considered fairly presented.  Ibid. Stating that its previous
opinion, Dye I, had disposed of any remaining claims, the Dye II panel vacated
the prior judgment and affirmed the District Court's denial of the habeas corpus
petition.

Dye seeks review here.  There are two errors in Dye II meriting reversal of the
judgment.

[***LEdHR1A] [1B]  [***LEdHR2] [2] First, the Court of Appeals was incorrect in
Dye II to conclude that, when seeking review in the state appellate court,
petitioner failed to raise the federal claim based on prosecutorial misconduct.
The Court of Appeals examined the opinion of the state appellate court and noted
that it made no mention of a federal claim. That, however, is not dispositive.
[HN1] Failure of a state appellate court to mention a federal claim does not
mean the claim was not presented to it.  ""It is too obvious to merit extended
discussion that whether the exhaustion requirement . . . has been satisfied
cannot turn upon whether a state appellate court chooses to ignore in its
opinion a federal constitutional claim [**7]  squarely raised in petitioner's
brief in the state court . . . .""  Smith v. Digmon, 434 U.S. 332, 333, 98 S. Ct.
597, 54 L. Ed. 2d 582 (1978) (per curiam).

[***LEdHR1A] [1C] Contrary to the holding of the Court of Appeals, the District
Court record contains the brief petitioner filed in state court, and the brief
sets out the federal claim. The fourth argument heading in his brief before the
Michigan Court of Appeals states: ""THE PROSECUTOR DENIED DEFENDANT DUE PROCESS
OF LAW AND A FAIR TRIAL BY NUMEROUS INSTANCES OF MISCONDUCT.""  [*4]  App. to
Pet. for Cert. 80 (capitalization in original).  Outlining specific allegations
of prosecutorial misconduct, the text of the brief under this argument heading
cites the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United
States.  It further cites the following federal cases, all of which concern
alleged violations of federal due process rights in the context of prosecutorial
misconduct:  Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 94 S. Ct. 1868, 40 L. Ed.
2d 431 (1974);  Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 55 S. Ct. 629, 79 L. Ed.
1314 (1935);  United States v. Valentine, 820 F.2d 565 (CA2 1987);  United
States v. Burse, 531 F.2d 1151 (CA2 1976).

This is not an instance where the habeas petitioner failed to ""apprise the state
court of his claim that the . . . ruling of which he complained was not only a
violation of state law, but denied him the due process of law guaranteed by the
Fourteenth Amendment.""  Duncan v. Henry, 513 U.S. 364, 366, 115 S. Ct. 887, 130
L. Ed. 2d 865 (1995) (per curiam). Nor  [***5]  is this a case where a state
court needed to look beyond ""a petition or a brief (or a similar document)"" to
be aware of the federal claim.  Baldwin v. Reese, 541 U.S. 27, 32, 124 S. Ct.
1347, 158 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2004).  The state-court brief was clear that the
prosecutorial misconduct claim was based,  at least in part, on a federal right.
It was error for the Court of Appeals to conclude otherwise.

A second reason the Dye II panel denied relief was that the habeas petition
filed in the United States District Court presented the prosecutorial misconduct
claim in too vague and general a form.  This alternative holding cannot rescue
the Dye II judgment, for it, too, is incorrect. The habeas corpus petition made
clear and repeated references to an appended supporting brief, which presented
Dye's federal claim with more than sufficient particularity.  See Fed. Rules
Civ. Proc. 81(a)(2), 10(c).  As the prosecutorial misconduct claim was presented
properly, it, and any other federal claims properly presented, should be
addressed by the Court of Appeals on remand.

[*5]  The motion to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for certiorari
are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is
remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A]  [***LEdHR2A] [2A]  [***LEdHR3A] [3A] This case presents the
question whether federal courts may craft an exception to the full faith and
credit statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1738, for claims brought under the Takings Clause of
the Fifth Amendment.

Petitioners, who own and operate a hotel in San Francisco, California
(hereinafter City), initiated this litigation in response to the application of
a city ordinance that required them to pay a $567,000 ""conversion fee"" in 1996.
After the California courts rejected petitioners' various state-law takings
claims, they advanced in the Federal District Court a series of federal takings
claims that depended on issues identical to those that had previously been
resolved in the state-court  [*327]  action.  In order to avoid the bar of issue
preclusion, petitioners asked the District Court to exempt from § 1738's reach
claims brought under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

[***LEdHR1A] [1B]  [***LEdHR2A] [2B]  [***LEdHR3A] [3B]  [***LEdHR4A] [4A]
Petitioners' argument is predicated on Williamson County Regional Planning
Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.S. 172, 87 L. Ed. 2d 126, 105 S.
Ct. 3108 (1985), which held that takings claims are not ripe until a State fails
""to provide adequate compensation for the taking."" Id., at 195, 87 L. Ed. 2d
126, 105 S. Ct. 3108.  Unless courts disregard § 1738 in takings cases,
petitioners argue, plaintiffs will be forced to litigate their claims in state
court without any realistic possibility of ever obtaining review in a federal
forum. The Ninth Circuit's rejection of this argument conflicted with the Second
Circuit's decision in Santini v. Connecticut Hazardous Waste Management Serv.,
342 F.3d 118 (2003).  We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 543 U.S.
1032, 160 L. Ed. 2d 518, 125 S. Ct. 685 (2004), 1 and now  [***327]  affirm the

which was rendered in a state court proceeding that was required to ripen the
federal Takings claim?"" Pet. for Cert. i.  Thus, we have no occasion to reach

The San Remo Hotel is a three-story, 62-unit hotel in the Fisherman's Wharf
neighborhood in San Francisco.  In December 1906, shortly after the great
earthquake and fire destroyed most of the City, the hotel--then called the ""New
California Hotel""--opened its doors to house dislocated individuals, immigrants,
artists, and laborers.  The City officially licensed the facility to operate as
a hotel and restaurant in 1916, and in 1922 the hotel was given its current
[*328]  name.  When the hotel fell into financial difficulties and a
""dilapidated condition"" in the early 1970's, Robert and Thomas Field purchased
the facility, restored it, and began to operate it as a bed and breakfast inn.
See San Remo Hotel, L. P. v. City and County of San Francisco, 83 Cal. App. 4th
239, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 1, 5 (Cal. App. 2000) (officially depublished).

In 1979, San Francisco's Board of Supervisors responded to ""a severe shortage""
of affordable rental housing for elderly, disabled, and low-income persons by
instituting a moratorium on the conversion of residential hotel units into
tourist units.  San Francisco Residential Hotel Unit Conversion and Demolition
Ordinance (hereinafter Hotel Conversion Ordinance or HCO) §§ 41.3(a)-(g), App.
to Pet. for Cert. 195a-197a.  [**2496]  Two years later,  the City enacted the
first version of the Hotel Conversion Ordinance to regulate all future
conversions. San Francisco Ordinance No. 330-81, codified in § 41.1 et seq.
Under the 1981 version of the HCO, a hotel owner could convert residential units
into tourist units only by obtaining a conversion permit.  And those permits
could be obtained only by constructing new residential units, rehabilitating old
ones, or paying an ""in lieu"" fee into the City's Residential Hotel Preservation
Fund Account.  See §§ 41.12-41.13, App. to Pet. for Cert. 224a-231a.  The City
substantially strengthened the HCO in 1990 by eliminating several exceptions
that had existed in the 1981 version and increasing the size of the ""in lieu""
fee hotel owners must pay when converting residential units.  See 145 F.3d 1095,
1099 (CA9 1998).

The genesis of this protracted dispute lies in the 1981 HCO's requirement that
each hotel ""file an initial unit usage report containing"" the ""number of
residential and tourist units in the hotel[s] as of September 23, 1979."" §
41.6(b)(1), App. to Pet. for Cert. 206a.  Jean Iribarren was operating the San
Remo Hotel, pursuant to a lease from petitioners, when this requirement came
into effect.  Iribarren filed the initial usage report for the hotel, which
erroneously reported  [*329]  that all of the rooms in the hotel were
""residential"" units. 2 The consequence of that initial classification was that
the City zoned the San  [***328]  Remo Hotel as ""residential hotel""--in other
words, a hotel that consisted entirely of residential units.  And that zoning
determination ultimately meant that, despite the fact that the San Remo Hotel
had operated in practice as a tourist hotel for many years, 145 F.3d, at 1100,
petitioners were required to apply for a conditional use permit to do business
officially as a ""tourist hotel,"" San Remo Hotel, L.P. v. City and County of San
Francisco, 27 Cal. 4th 643, 654, 117 Cal. Rptr. 2d 269, 41 P. 3d 87, 94 (2002).

2 It seems that despite this initial classification, the San Remo Hotel has
operated as a mixed hotel for tourists and long-term residents since long before
the HCO was enacted.  According to the California Supreme Court, in ""a 1992
declaration by [petitioners], Iribarren filed the 'incorrect' initial unit usage
report without their knowledge.  They first discovered the report in 1983 when
they resumed operation of the hotel. They protested the residential use
classification in 1987, but were told it could not be changed because the appeal
period had passed."" San Remo Hotel, L.P. v. City and County of San Francisco, 27

 After the HCO was revised in 1990, petitioners applied to convert all of the
rooms in the San Remo Hotel into tourist use rooms under the relevant HCO
provisions and requested a conditional use permit under the applicable zoning
laws.  In 1993, the City Planning Commission granted petitioners' requested
conversion and conditional use permit, but only after imposing several
conditions, one of which included the requirement that petitioners pay a
$567,000 ""in lieu"" fee. 3 Petitioners appealed, arguing that the HCO requirement
was unconstitutional and otherwise improperly applied to their hotel. See id.,
at 656, 41 P. 3d, at 95.  The City Board of Supervisors rejected petitioners'
appeal on April 19, 1993.

3 The application specifically required petitioners (1) to pay for 40 percent of
the cost of replacement housing for the 62 lost residential units; (2) to offer
lifetime leases to any then-current residential users; and (3) to ""obtain
variances from floor-area ratio and parking requirements."" Id., at 656, 41 P.

 [*330]   In March 1993, petitioners filed for a writ of administrative mandamus
in California Superior Court.  That action lay dormant for several years, and
the parties ultimately agreed to stay that action after petitioners filed for
relief in Federal District Court.

[**2497]  Petitioners filed in federal court for the first time on May 4, 1993.
Petitioners' first amended complaint alleged four counts of due process
(substantive and procedural) and takings (facial and as-applied) 4 violations
under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, one
count seeking damages under Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, for those
violations, and one pendent state-law claim.  The District Court granted
respondents summary judgment.  As relevant to this action, the court found that
petitioners' facial takings claim was untimely under the applicable statute of
limitations, and that the as-applied takings claim was unripe under Williamson
County, 473 U.S. 172, 87 L. Ed. 2d 126, 105 S. Ct. 3108.

4 Specifically, count 3 alleged that the HCO was facially unconstitutional under
the Takings Clause because it ""fails to substantially advance legitimate
government interests, deprives plaintiffs of the opportunity to earn a fair
return on its investment, denies plaintiffs economically viable use of their
property, and forces plaintiffs to bear the public burden of housing the poor,
all without just compensation."" First Amended and Supplemental Complaint, No.
C-93-1644-DLJ (ND Cal., Jan. 24, 1994), p 20, P 49.  Count 4, which advanced
petitioners' as-applied Takings Clause violation, was predicated on the same
rationale.  Id., at 21.

  [***LEdHR2A] [2C] On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,
petitioners took the unusual position that the court should not decide their
federal claims, but instead should abstain under Railroad Comm'n of Tex. v.
Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 85 L. Ed. 971, 61 S. Ct. 643 (1941), because a return
to state court could  [***329]  conceivably moot the remaining federal
questions.  See App. 67-68; see also 145 F.3d, at 1101.  The Court of Appeals
obliged petitioners' request with respect to the facial challenge, a request
that respondents apparently viewed as an ""outrageous act of chutzpah."" Id., at
1105.  That claim, the court reasoned,  [*331]  was ""ripe the instant the 1990
HCO was enacted,"" id., at 1102, and appropriate for Pullman abstention
principally because petitioners' ""entire case"" hinged on the propriety of the
planning commission's zoning designation--the precise subject of the pending
state mandamus action, 145 F.3d, at 1105. 5 The court, however, affirmed the
District Court's determination that petitioners' as-applied takings claim--the
claim that the application of the HCO to the San Remo Hotel violated the Takings
Clause --was unripe. Because petitioners had failed to pursue an inverse
condemnation action in state court, they had not yet been denied just
compensation as contemplated by Williamson County. 145 F.3d, at 1105.

 [***LEdHR2A] [2D] At the conclusion of the Ninth Circuit's opinion, the court
appended a footnote stating that petitioners would be free to raise their
federal takings claims in the California courts.  If, however, they wanted to
""retain [their] right to return to federal court for adjudication of [their]
federal claim, [they] must make an appropriate reservation in state court."" Id.,
at 1106, n. 7. 6 That is precisely what petitioners attempted to do when they
reactivated the dormant California case.  Yet petitioners advanced more than
just the claims on which the federal court had abstained, and phrased their
state claims in  [**2498] language that sounded in the rules and standards
established and refined by this Court's takings jurisprudence.  Petitioners
claimed, for instance, that ""imposition of the fee 'fails to substantially
advance a legitimate government interest' and that 'the amount of the fee
imposed is not roughly proportional to the impact' of the proposed tourist use
of the San Remo Hotel."" 27 Cal. 4th, at 656, 41 P. 3d, at 95 (quoting
petitioners' second amended  [*332]  state complaint). 7

The state trial court dismissed petitioners' amended  complaint, but the
intermediate appellate court reversed.  The court held that petitioners' claim
that the payment of the ""in lieu"" fee effected a taking should have been
evaluated under heightened scrutiny.  Under more exacting scrutiny, the fee
failed this Court's ""essential nexus"" and ""rough proportionality"" tests because,
inter alia, it was based on the original flawed designation that the San Remo
Hotel was an entirely ""residential  [***330]  use"" facility.  See id., at
657-658, 41 P.3d, at 96-97 (summarizing appellate court opinion (internal
quotation marks omitted)).

The California Supreme Court reversed over the partial dissent of three
justices. 8 The court initially noted that petitioners had reserved their
federal causes of action and had sought no relief for any violation of the
Federal Constitution.  Id., at 649, n. 1, 41 P. 3d, at 91, n. 1. 9 In the
portion of its opinion discussing the Takings Clause of the California
Constitution, however, the court noted that ""we appear to have construed the
clauses congruently."" Id., at 664, 41 P. 3d, at 100-101 (citing cases).
Accordingly, despite the fact that petitioners sought relief only under
California law, the state court decided to ""analyze their takings claim under
the  [*333]  relevant decisions of both this court and the United States Supreme
Court."" Ibid., 41 P. 3d, at 101. 10

Amendment to the United States Constitution.  They explicitly reserved their

The principal constitutional issue debated by the parties was whether a
heightened level of scrutiny applied to the claim that the housing replacement
fee ""'does not substantially advance legitimate state interests.'"" Ibid.
(quoting Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1016, 120 L.
Ed. 2d 798, 112 S. Ct. 2886 (1992)).  In resolving that debate the court focused
on our opinions in Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U.S. 825, 97 L. Ed.
2d 677, 107 S. Ct. 3141 (1987), and Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374, 129
L. Ed. 2d 304, 114 S. Ct. 2309 (1994).  Rejecting petitioners' argument that
heightened scrutiny should apply, the court emphasized the distinction between
discretionary exactions imposed by executive officials on an ad hoc basis and
[**2499]  ""'generally applicable zoning regulations'"" involving ""'legislative
determinations.'"" 27 Cal. 4th, at 666-668, 41 P. 3d, at 102-104 (quoting, e.g.,
Dolan, 512 U.S., at 385, 391, n. 8).  The court situated the HCO within the
latter category, reasoning that the ordinance relied upon fixed fees computed
under a formula that is generally applicable to broad classes of property
owners. 11 The court concluded that the less demanding ""reasonable relationship""
[***331]  test should apply to the HCO's monetary assessments, 27 Cal. 4th, at
671, 41 P. 3d, at 105.

applicable legislation in that it applies, without discretion or discrimination,
to every residential hotel in the city"" and that ""no meaningful government
discretion enters into either the imposition or the calculation of the in lieu
fee"").  The court noted that the general class of property owners included more
than 500 properties containing over 18,000 rooms, id., at 669, n. 12, 41 P. 3d,
at 104, n. 12, and concluded that the HCO ""applies to all property in the class
logically subject to its strictures, that is, to all residential hotel units; no
more can rationally be demanded of local land use legislation in order to
qualify for deferential review,"" id., at 669, 41 P. 3d, at 104.

 [*334]  Applying the ""reasonable relationship"" test, the court upheld the HCO
on its face and as applied to petitioners.  As to the facial challenge, the
court concluded that the HCO's mandated conversion fees ""bear a reasonable
relationship to loss of housing . . . in the generality or great majority of
cases . . . ."" Id., at 673, 41 P. 3d, at 107.  With respect to petitioners'
as-applied challenge, the court concluded that the conversion fee was reasonably
based on the number of units designated for conversion, which itself was based
on petitioners' own estimate that had been provided to the City in 1981 and had
remained unchallenged for years.  Id., at 678, and n 17, 41 P. 3d, at 110-111,
and n 17.  The court therefore reversed the appellate court and reinstated the
trial court's order dismissing petitioners' complaint.

Petitioners did not seek a writ of certiorari from the California Supreme
Court's decision in this Court.  Instead, they returned to Federal District
Court by filing an amended complaint based on the complaint that they had filed
prior to invoking Pullman abstention. 12 The District Court held that
petitioners' facial attack on the HCO was not only barred by the statute of
limitations, but also by the general rule of issue preclusion.  See App. to Pet.
for Cert. 85a-86a. 13  [*335]  The District Court reasoned that 28 U.S.C. § 1738
requires federal courts to give preclusive effect to any  [**2500] state-court
judgment that would have preclusive effect under the laws of the State in which
the judgment was rendered.  Because California courts had interpreted the
relevant substantive state takings law coextensively with federal law,
petitioners' federal claims constituted the same claims that had already been
resolved in state court.

12 The third amended complaint, which was filed on November 14, 2002, alleged
two separate counts.  See App. 88-93.  Count 1 alleged that the HCO was facially
unconstitutional and unconstitutional as applied to petitioners because (a) it
failed ""to substantially advance legitimate government interests""; (b) it forced
petitioners ""to bear the public burden of housing the poor""; and (c) it imposed
unreasonable conditions on petitioners' request for a conditional use permit
(the in lieu fee and the required lifetime leases to residential tenants).  Id.,
at 88-89.  Count 2 sought relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 based on (a) extortion
through the imposition of the $567,000 fee; (b) an actual taking of property
under Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 57 L. Ed. 2d 631,
98 S. Ct. 2646 (1978); (c) the failure of the HCO as applied to petitioners to
advance legitimate state interests; (d) the City's requirement that petitioners
bear the full cost of providing a general public benefit (public housing)
without just compensation.

13 The District Court found that most of petitioners' as-applied claims amounted
to nothing more than improperly labeled facial challenges.  See App. to Pet. for
Cert. 82a-85a.  The remainder of petitioners' as-applied claims, the court held,
was barred by the statute of limitations.  Id., at 84a-85a.

 [***LEdHR4A] [4C] The Court of Appeals affirmed.  The court rejected
petitioners' contention that general preclusion principles should be cast aside
whenever plaintiffs ""must litigate in state court pursuant to Pullman and/or
Williamson County."" 364 F.3d 1088, 1096 (CA9 2004).  Relying on unambiguous
Circuit precedent and the absence of any clearly contradictory decisions from
this Court, the Court of Appeals found itself bound to apply general issue
preclusion doctrine.  Given that general issue preclusion principles governed,
the only remaining  [***332]  question was whether the District Court properly
applied that doctrine; the court concluded that it did.  The court expressly
rejected petitioners' contention ""that California takings law is not coextensive
with federal takings law,"" ibid.,  and held that the state court's application
of the ""reasonable relationship"" test was an ""'equivalent determination' of such
claims under the federal takings clause,"" id., at 1098. 14 We granted certiorari
and now affirm.

14  [***LEdHR4A] [4D] California courts apply issue preclusion to a final
judgment in earlier litigation between the same parties if ""(1) the issue
decided in the prior case is identical with the one now presented; (2) there was
a final judgment on the merits in the prior case, and (3) the party to be
estopped was a party to the prior adjudication."" 364 F.3d, at 1096.  The court
reasoned that the California Supreme Court's decision satisfied those criteria
because petitioners' takings challenges ""raised in state court are identical to
the federal claims . . . and are based on the same factual allegations."" Ibid.

of Appeals' reading of California preclusion law was in error.

litigants who seek to advance federal takings claims that are not ripe until the

[8A] The essence of petitioners' argument is as follows: because no claim that a
state agency has violated the federal Takings Clause can be heard in federal
court until the property owner has ""been denied just compensation"" through an
available state compensation procedure, id., at 195, 87 L. Ed. 2d 126, 105 S.

state court"" in order to ensure that federal takings claims can be ""considered

the argument goes, whenever plaintiffs reserve their claims under England v.

"                     ILLINOIS, Petitioner v. ROY I. CABALLES",543 U.S. 405,"

 [*406]  [**836]   Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A]  Illinois State Trooper Daniel Gillette stopped respondent for
speeding on an interstate highway.  When Gillette radioed the police dispatcher
to report the stop, a second trooper, Craig Graham, a member of the Illinois
State Police Drug  [***846]  Interdiction Team, overheard the transmission and
immediately headed for the scene with his narcotics-detection dog. When they
arrived, respondent's car was on the shoulder of the road and respondent was in
Gillette's vehicle.  While Gillette was in the process of writing a warning
ticket, Graham walked his dog around respondent's car.  The dog alerted at the
trunk. Based on that alert, the officers searched the trunk, found marijuana,
and arrested respondent.  The entire incident lasted less than 10 minutes.

[*407]  Respondent was convicted of a narcotics offense and sentenced to 12
years' imprisonment and a $256,136 fine.  The trial judge denied his motion to
suppress the seized evidence and to quash his arrest.  He held that the officers
had not unnecessarily prolonged the stop and that the dog alert was sufficiently
reliable to provide probable cause to conduct the search.  Although the
Appellate Court affirmed, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed, concluding that
because the canine sniff was performed without any ""'specific and articulable
facts'"" to suggest drug activity, the use of the dog ""unjustifiably  [**837]
enlarg[ed] the scope of a routine traffic stop into a drug investigation.""  207
Ill. 2d 504, 510, 802 N.E.2d 202, 205, 280 Ill. Dec. 277 (2003).

[***LEdHR2] [2] The question on which we granted certiorari,  541 U.S. 972, 159
L. Ed. 2d 84, 124 S. Ct. 2219 (2004), is narrow: ""Whether the Fourth Amendment
requires reasonable, articulable suspicion to justify using a drug-detection dog
to sniff a vehicle during a legitimate traffic stop."" Pet. for Cert. i.  Thus,
we proceed on the assumption that the officer conducting the dog sniff had no
information about respondent except that he had been stopped for speeding;
accordingly, we have omitted any reference to facts about respondent that might
have triggered a modicum of suspicion.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR3] [3]  [***LEdHR4] [4] Here, the initial seizure of
respondent when he was stopped on the highway was based on probable cause and
was concededly lawful. It is nevertheless clear that  [HN1] a seizure that is
lawful at its inception can violate the Fourth Amendment if its manner of
execution unreasonably infringes interests protected by the Constitution.
United States v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 124, 80 L. Ed. 2d 85, 104 S. Ct. 1652
(1984).  A seizure that is justified solely by the interest in issuing a warning
ticket to the driver can become unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time
reasonably required to complete that mission.  In an earlier case involving a
dog sniff that occurred during an unreasonably prolonged traffic stop, the
Illinois Supreme Court held that use of the dog and the subsequent discovery
[*408]  of contraband were the product of an unconstitutional seizure.  People
v. Cox, 202 Ill. 2d 462, 782 N.E.2d 275, 270 Ill. Dec. 81 (2002).  We may assume
that a similar result would be warranted in this case if the dog sniff had been
conducted while respondent was being unlawfully detained.

[***LEdHR1A]  In the state-court proceedings, however, the judges carefully
reviewed the details of Officer Gillette's conversations with respondent and the
precise timing of his radio transmissions to the dispatcher to determine whether
he had improperly extended the duration of the stop to enable the dog sniff to
occur.  We have not recounted those details because we accept the state court's
conclusion that the duration of the stop in this case was entirely justified
[***847]  by the traffic offense and the ordinary inquiries incident to such a
stop.

[***LEdHR5A]  Despite this conclusion, the Illinois Supreme Court held that the
initially lawful traffic stop became an unlawful seizure solely as a result of
the canine sniff that occurred outside respondent's stopped car.  That is, the
court characterized the dog sniff as the cause rather than the consequence of a
constitutional violation.  In its view, the use of the dog converted the
citizen-police encounter from a lawful traffic stop into a drug investigation,
and because the shift in purpose was not supported by any reasonable suspicion
that respondent possessed narcotics, it was unlawful.  In our view, conducting a
dog sniff would not change the character of a traffic stop that is lawful at its
inception and otherwise executed in a reasonable manner, unless the dog sniff
itself infringed respondent's constitutionally protected interest in privacy.
Our cases hold that it did not.

[***LEdHR6] [6]   [HN2] Official conduct that does not ""compromise any
legitimate interest in privacy"" is not a search subject to the Fourth Amendment.
Jacobsen, 466 U.S., at 123, 80 L. Ed. 2d 85, 104 S. Ct. 1652.  We have held that
any interest in possessing contraband cannot be deemed ""legitimate,"" and thus,
governmental conduct that only reveals the possession of contraband ""compromises
no legitimate privacy interest."" Ibid. This is because the expectation  [*409]
""that certain facts will not come to the attention of the authorities"" is not
the same as an interest [**838]  in ""privacy that society is prepared to
consider reasonable.  ""  Id., at 122, 80 L. Ed. 2d 85, 104 S. Ct. 1652
(punctuation omitted).  In  United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 77 L. Ed. 2d
110, 103 S. Ct. 2637 (1983),  [HN3] we treated a canine sniff by a well-trained
narcotics-detection dog as ""sui generis"" because it ""discloses only the presence
or absence of narcotics, a contraband item.""  Id., at 707, 77 L. Ed. 2d 110, 103

designed, and if properly conducted are generally likely, to reveal only the
presence of contraband."" Brief for Respondent 17.  Although respondent argues
that the error rates, particularly the existence of false positives, call into
question the premise that drug-detection dogs alert only to contraband, the
record contains no evidence or findings that support his argument.  Moreover,
respondent does not suggest that an erroneous alert, in and of itself, reveals
any legitimate private information, and, in this case, the trial judge found
that the dog sniff was sufficiently reliable to establish probable cause to
conduct a full-blown search of the trunk.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR5A]  Accordingly,  [HN4] the use of a well-trained
narcotics-detection dog--one that ""does not expose noncontraband items that
otherwise would remain hidden from public view,""  Place, 462 U.S., at 707, 77 L.
Ed. 2d 110, 103 S. Ct. 2637 --during a lawful traffic stop, generally does not
implicate legitimate privacy interests.  In this case, the dog sniff was
performed on the exterior of respondent's car while he was lawfully seized for a
traffic violation.  Any intrusion on respondent's privacy expectations does not
rise to the level of a constitutionally cognizable infringement.

[***LEdHR5A]  This conclusion is entirely  [***848]  consistent with our recent
decision that the use of a thermal-imaging device to detect the growth of
marijuana in a home constituted an unlawful search.   Kyllo v. United States,
533 U.S. 27, 150 L. Ed. 2d 94, 121 S. Ct. 2038 (2001).  Critical to that
decision was the fact that the device was capable of detecting lawful
activity--in that case, intimate details in a [*410]  home, such as ""at what
hour each night the lady of the house takes her daily sauna and bath.""  Id., at
38, 150 L. Ed. 2d 94, 121 S. Ct. 2038.  The legitimate expectation that
information about perfectly lawful activity will remain private is categorically
distinguishable from respondent's hopes or expectations concerning the
nondetection of contraband in the trunk of his car.   [HN5] A dog sniff
conducted during a concededly lawful traffic stop that reveals no information
other than the location of a substance that no individual has any right to
possess does not violate the Fourth Amendment.

The judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court is vacated, and the case is remanded
for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

The Chief Justice took no part in the decision of this case.

DISSENT

Justice Souter, dissenting.

I would hold that using the dog for the purposes of determining the presence of
marijuana in the car's trunk was a search unauthorized as an incident of the
speeding stop and unjustified on any other ground.  I would accordingly affirm
the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois, and I respectfully dissent.

In  United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 77 L. Ed. 2d 110, 103 S. Ct. 2637
(1983), we categorized the sniff of the narcotics-seeking dog as ""sui generis""
under the Fourth Amendment and held it was not a search.   Id., at 707, 77 L.
Ed. 2d 110, 103 S. Ct. 2637.  The classification rests not only upon the limited
nature [**839]  of the intrusion, but on a further premise that experience has
shown to be untenable, the assumption that trained sniffing dogs do not err.
What we have learned about the fallibility of dogs in the years since Place was
decided would itself be reason to call for reconsidering Place's decision
against treating the intentional use of a trained dog as a search.  The portent
of this very case, however, adds insistence  [*411]  to the call, for an
uncritical adherence to Place would render the Fourth Amendment indifferent to
suspicionless and indiscriminate sweeps of cars in parking garages and
pedestrians on sidewalks; if a sniff is not preceded by a seizure subject to
Fourth Amendment notice, it escapes Fourth Amendment review entirely unless it
is treated as a search.  We should not wait for these developments to occur
before rethinking Place's analysis, which invites such untoward consequences. 1

1 I also join Justice Ginsburg's dissent, post, p. 417, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 853.
Without directly reexamining the soundness of the Court's analysis of government
dog sniffs in Place, she demonstrates that investigation into a matter beyond
the subject of the traffic stop here offends the rule in  Terry v. Ohio, 392
U.S. 1, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889, 88 S. Ct. 1868 (1968), the analysis I, too, adopt.

 At the heart both of Place and the  [***849]  Court's opinion today is the
proposition that sniffs by a trained dog are sui generis because a reaction by
the dog in going alert is a response to nothing but the presence of contraband.
2 See ibid. (""[T]he sniff discloses only the presence or absence of narcotics, a
contraband item""); ante, at 409, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 847 (assuming that ""a canine
sniff by a well-trained narcotics-detection dog"" will only reveal ""'the presence
or absence of narcotics, a contraband item'"" (quoting  Place, supra, at 707, 77
L. Ed. 2d 110, 103 S. Ct. 2637)).  Hence, the argument goes, because the sniff
can only reveal the presence of items devoid of any legal use, the sniff ""does
not implicate legitimate privacy interests"" and is not to be treated as a
search.  Ante, at 409, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 847.

2 Another proffered justification for sui generis status is that a dog sniff is
a particularly nonintrusive procedure.   United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696,
707, 77 L. Ed. 2d 110, 103 S. Ct. 2637 (1983).  I agree with Justice Ginsburg
that the introduction of a dog to a traffic stop (let alone an encounter with
someone walking down the street) can in fact be quite intrusive.  Post, at 421 -
422, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 854-855 (dissenting opinion).

 The infallible dog, however, is a creature of legal fiction.  Although the
Supreme Court of Illinois did not get into the sniffing averages of drug dogs,
their supposed infallibility is belied by judicial opinions describing
well-trained animals sniffing and alerting with less than perfect accuracy,
whether  [*412]  owing to errors by their handlers, the limitations of the dogs
themselves, or even the pervasive contamination of currency by cocaine.  See,
e.g.,  United States v. Kennedy, 131 F.3d 1371, 1378 (CA10 1997) (describing a
dog that had a 71% accuracy rate);  United States v. Scarborough, 128 F.3d 1373,
1378, n. 3 (CA10 1997) (describing a dog that erroneously alerted 4 times out of
19 while working for the postal service and 8% of the time over its entire
career);  United States v. Limares, 269 F.3d 794, 797 (CA7 2001) (accepting as
reliable a dog that gave false positives between 7% and 38% of the time);  Laime
v. State, 347 Ark. 142, 159, 60 S. W. 3d 464, 476 (2001) (speaking of a dog that
made between 10 and 50 errors);  United States v. $ 242,484.00, 351 F.3d 499,
511 (CA11 2003) (noting that because as much as 80% of all currency in
circulation contains drug residue, a dog alert ""is of little value""), vacated on
other grounds by rehearing en banc,  357 F.3d 1225 (CA11 2004);  United States
v. Carr, 25 F.3d 1194, 1214-1217 (CA3 1994) (Becker, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part) (""[A] [**840]  substantial portion of United States currency
. . . is tainted with sufficient traces of controlled substances to cause a
trained canine to alert to their presence"").  Indeed, a study cited by Illinois
in this case for the proposition that dog sniffs are ""generally reliable"" shows
that dogs in artificial testing situations return false positives anywhere from
12.55 to 60% of the time, depending on the length of the search.  See Reply
Brief for Petitioner 13; Federal Aviation Admin., K. Garner et al., Duty Cycle
of the Detector Dog: A Baseline Study 12 (Apr. 2001) (prepared by the Auburn U.
Inst. for Biological Detection Systems).  In practical terms, the evidence is
clear that the dog that alerts hundreds of times will be wrong dozens of times.

Once the dog's fallibility is recognized, however, that ends the justification
claimed in Place for treating  [***850]  the sniff as sui generis under the
Fourth Amendment: the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband,
and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has  [*413]
sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime.
This is not, of course, to deny that a dog's reaction may provide reasonable
suspicion, or probable cause, to search the container or enclosure; the Fourth
Amendment does not demand certainty of success to justify a search for evidence
or contraband. The point is simply that the sniff and alert cannot claim the
certainty that Place assumed, both in treating the deliberate use of sniffing
dogs as sui generis and then taking that characterization as a reason to say
they are not searches subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny.  And when that aura
of uniqueness disappears, there is no basis in Place's reasoning, and no good
reason otherwise, to ignore the actual function that dog sniffs perform.  They
are conducted to obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond
anything that human senses could perceive, even when conventionally enhanced.
The information is not provided by independent third parties beyond the reach of
constitutional limitations, but gathered by the government's own officers in
order to justify searches of the traditional sort, which may or may not reveal
evidence of crime but will disclose anything meant to be kept private in the
area searched.  Thus in practice the government's use of a trained narcotics dog
functions as a limited search to reveal undisclosed facts about private
enclosures, to be used to justify a further and complete search of the enclosed
area.  And given the fallibility of the dog, the sniff is the first step in a
process that may disclose ""intimate details"" without revealing contraband, just
as a thermal-imaging device might do, as described in  Kyllo v. United States,
533 U.S. 27, 150 L. Ed. 2d 94, 121 S. Ct. 2038 (2001). 3

3 Kyllo was concerned with whether a search occurred when the police used a
thermal-imaging device on a house to detect heat emanations associated with
high-powered marijuana-growing lamps.  In concluding that using the device was a
search, the Court stressed that the ""Government [may not] us[e] a device . . .
to explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable
without physical intrusion.""  533 U.S., at 40, 150 L. Ed. 94, 121 S. Ct. 2038.
Any difference between the dwelling in Kyllo and the trunk of the car here may
go to the issue of the reasonableness of the respective searches, but it has no
bearing on the question of search or no search.  Nor is it significant that
Kyllo's imaging device would disclose personal details immediately, whereas they
would be revealed only in the further step of opening the enclosed space
following the dog's alert reaction; in practical terms the same values protected
by the Fourth Amendment are at stake in each case.  The justifications required
by the Fourth Amendment may or may not differ as between the two practices, but
if constitutional scrutiny is in order for the imager, it is in order for the
dog.

  [**841]   [*414]  It makes sense, then, to treat a sniff as the search that it
amounts to in practice, and to rely on the body of our Fourth Amendment cases,
including Kyllo, in deciding whether such a search is reasonable.  As a general
proposition, using a dog to sniff for drugs is subject to the rule that the
object of enforcing criminal laws does not, without more, justify suspicionless
Fourth Amendment intrusions. See  Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32, 41-42,
148 L. Ed. 2d 333, 121 S. Ct. 447 (2000).  Since the police claim to have had no
particular suspicion that Caballes was  [***851]  violating any drug law, 4 this
sniff search must stand or fall on its being ancillary to the traffic stop that
led up to it.  It is true that the police had probable cause to stop the car for
an offense committed in the officer's presence, which Caballes concedes could
have justified his arrest.  See Brief for Respondent 31.  There is no occasion
to consider authority incident to arrest, however, see  Knowles v. Iowa, 525
U.S. 113, 142 L. Ed. 2d 492, 119 S. Ct. 484 (1998), for the police did nothing
more than detain Caballes long enough to check his record and write a ticket. As
a consequence, the reasonableness of the search must be assessed in relation to
the actual delay the police chose to impose, and as Justice Ginsburg points out
in her opinion, post, at 419 - 420, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 854-855, the Fourth
Amendment consequences of stopping for a traffic citation are settled law.

reason for the stop, and the case comes to us on that assumption.

 [*415]  In  Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 439-440, 82 L. Ed. 2d 317, 104
S. Ct. 3138 (1984), followed in  Knowles, supra, at 117, 142 L. Ed. 492, 119 S.
Ct. 484, we held that the analogue of the common traffic stop was the limited
detention for investigation authorized by  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 20 L. Ed.
2d 889, 88 S. Ct. 1868 (1968).  While Terry authorized a restricted incidental
search for weapons when reasonable suspicion warrants such a safety measure,
id., at 25-26, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889, 88 S. Ct. 1868, the Court took care to keep a
Terry stop from automatically becoming a foot in the door for all investigatory
purposes; the permissible intrusion was bounded by the justification for the
detention,  id., at 29-30, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889, 88 S. Ct. 1868. 5 Although facts
disclosed by enquiry within this limit might give grounds to go further, the
government could not otherwise take advantage of a suspect's immobility to
search for evidence unrelated to the reason for the detention. That has to be
the rule unless Terry is going to become an open-sesame for general searches,
and that rule requires holding that the police do not have reasonable grounds to
conduct sniff searches for drugs simply because they have stopped someone to
receive a ticket for a highway offense.  Since the police had no indication of
illegal activity beyond the speed of the car in this case, the sniff search
should be held unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment and its fruits should be
suppressed.

how Place had acted suspiciously in line at the airport and had labeled his

 Nothing in the case relied upon by the Court,  United States v. Jacobsen, 466
U.S. 109, 80 L. Ed. 2d 85, 104 S. Ct. 1652 (1984), unsettled the limit of
reasonable enquiry adopted in Terry. In Jacobsen, the Court found that no Fourth
Amendment search occurred when federal agents analyzed [**842]  powder they had
already lawfully obtained.  The Court noted that because the test could only
reveal whether the powder was cocaine, the owner had no legitimate privacy
interest at stake.   466 U.S., at 123, 80 L. Ed. 2d 85, 104 S. Ct. 1652.
[*416]  As already explained, however, the use of a sniffing dog in  [***852]
cases like this is significantly different and properly treated as a search that
does indeed implicate Fourth Amendment protection.

In Jacobsen, once the powder was analyzed, that was effectively the end of the
matter: either the powder was cocaine, a fact the owner had no legitimate
interest in concealing, or it was not cocaine, in which case the test revealed
nothing about the powder or anything else that was not already legitimately
obvious to the police.  But in the case of the dog sniff, the dog does not smell
the disclosed contraband; it smells a closed container.  An affirmative reaction
therefore does not identify a substance the police already legitimately possess,
but informs the police instead merely of a reasonable chance of finding
contraband they have yet to put their hands on.  The police will then open the
container and discover whatever lies within, be it marijuana or the owner's
private papers.  Thus, while Jacobsen could rely on the assumption that the
enquiry in question would either show with certainty that a known substance was
contraband or would reveal nothing more, both the certainty and the limit on
disclosure that may follow are missing when the dog sniffs the car. 6

6 It would also be error to claim that some variant of the plain-view doctrine
excuses the lack of justification for the dog sniff in this case.  When an
officer observes an object left by its owner in plain view, no search occurs
because the owner has exhibited ""no intention to keep [the object] to himself.""
Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 361, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576, 88 S. Ct. 507 (1967)
(Harlan, J., concurring).  In contrast, when an individual conceals his
possessions from the world, he has grounds to expect some degree of privacy.
While plain view may be enhanced somewhat by technology, see, e.g.,  Dow
Chemical Co. v. United States, 476 U.S. 227, 90 L. Ed. 2d 226, 106 S. Ct. 1819
(1986) (allowing for aerial surveillance of an industrial complex), there are
limits.  As  Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27, 33, 150 L. Ed. 2d 94, 121 S.
Ct. 2038 (2001), explained in treating the thermal-imaging device as outside the
plain-view doctrine, ""[w]e have previously reserved judgment as to how much
technological enhancement of ordinary perception"" turns mere observation into a
Fourth Amendment search.  While Kyllo laid special emphasis on the heightened
privacy expectations that surround the home, closed car trunks are accorded some
level of privacy protection.  See, e.g.,  New York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454, 460,
n. 4, 69 L. Ed. 2d 768, 101 S. Ct. 2860 (1981) (holding that even a search
incident to arrest in a vehicle does not itself permit a search of the trunk).
As a result, if Fourth Amendment protections are to have meaning in the face of
superhuman, yet fallible, techniques like the use of trained dogs, those
techniques must be justified on the basis of their reasonableness, lest
everything be deemed in plain view.

  [*417]  The Court today does not go so far as to say explicitly that sniff
searches by dogs trained to sense contraband always get a free pass under the
Fourth Amendment, since it reserves judgment on the constitutional significance
of sniffs assumed to be more intrusive than a dog's walk around a stopped car,
ante, at 409, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 847.  For this reason, I do not take the Court's
reliance on Jacobsen as actually signaling recognition of a broad authority to
conduct suspicionless sniffs for drugs in any parked car, about which Justice
Ginsburg is rightly concerned, post, at 422, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 855-856, or on
the person of any pedestrian minding his own business on a sidewalk.  But the
Court's stated reasoning provides no apparent stopping point short of such
excesses.  For the sake of providing a workable framework to analyze cases on
facts like these, which are certain to come along, I would treat the dog sniff
as the familiar search it is in fact,  [**843]  subject  [***853]  to scrutiny
under the Fourth Amendment. 7

7 I should take care myself to reserve judgment about a possible case
significantly unlike this one.  All of us are concerned not to prejudge a claim
of authority to detect explosives and dangerous chemical or biological weapons
that might be carried by a terrorist who prompts no individualized suspicion.
Suffice it to say here that what is a reasonable search depends in part on
demonstrated risk.  Unreasonable sniff searches for marijuana are not
necessarily unreasonable sniff searches for destructive or deadly material if
suicide bombs are a societal risk.

Illinois State Police Trooper Daniel Gillette stopped Roy Caballes for driving
71 miles per hour in a zone with a posted  [*418]  speed limit of 65 miles per
hour.  Trooper Craig Graham of the Drug Interdiction Team heard on the radio
that Trooper Gillette was making a traffic stop. Although Gillette requested no
aid, Graham decided to come to the scene to conduct a dog sniff. Gillette
informed Caballes that he was speeding and asked for the usual
documents--driver's license, car registration, and proof of insurance.  Caballes
promptly provided the requested documents but refused to consent to a search of
his vehicle.  After calling his dispatcher to check on the validity of Caballes'
license and for outstanding warrants, Gillette returned to his vehicle to write
Caballes a warning ticket. Interrupted by a radio call on an unrelated matter,
Gillette was still writing the ticket when Trooper Graham arrived with his
drug-detection dog. Graham walked the dog around the car, the dog alerted at
Caballes' trunk, and, after opening the trunk, the troopers found marijuana.

organization"" acting ""as a contractor"" would incur ""to ensure compliance with
the terms of the contract and prudent management."" Ibid. ""[C]ontract support
costs"" can include indirect administrative costs, such as special auditing or
other financial management costs, § 450j-1(a)(3)(A)(ii); they can include direct
costs, such as workers' compensation insurance, § 450j-1(a)(3)(A)(i); and they
can include certain startup costs, § 450j-1(a)(5).  Most contract support costs
are indirect costs ""generally calculated by applying an 'indirect cost rate' to
the amount of funds otherwise payable to the Tribe."" Brief for Federal Parties
7; see 25 U.S.C. §§ 450b(f)-(g) [25 USCS §§ 450b(f)-(g)].

The first case before us concerns Shoshone-Paiute contracts for fiscal years FYs
1996 and 1997 and a Cherokee Nation contract for 1997.  The second case concerns
Cherokee Nation contracts for fiscal years FYs 1994, 1995, and 1996.  In each
contract, the Tribe agreed to supply health services that a Government agency,
the Indian Health Service, would otherwise have provided.  See, e.g., App. 88-92
(Shoshone-Paiute Tribal Health Compact), 173-175 (Compact between the United
States and the Cherokee Nation).  Each contract included an ""Annual Funding
Agreement"" with a Government promise to pay contract support costs.  See, e.g.,
id., at 104-128, 253-264.  In each instance, the Government refused to pay the
full amount promised because, the Government says, Congress did not appropriate
sufficient funds.

Both cases began as administrative proceedings.  In the first case, the Tribes
submitted claims seeking payment under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, 92
Stat 2383, 41 U.S.C. § 601 et seq.[41 USCS §§ 601 et seq.], and the Act, 25
U.S.C. §§ 450m-1(a), (d), 458cc(h )[25 USCS §§ 450m-1(a), (d), 458cc(h)], from
the Department of the Interior (which manages the relevant appropriations).
See, e.g., App. 150-151,  [*636]  201-203.  The Department denied their claim;
they then brought a breach-of-contract action in the Federal District Court for
the Eastern District of Oklahoma seeking $3.5 million (Shoshone-Paiute) and $3.4
million (Cherokee Nation).  See  Cherokee Nation of Okla. v. Thompson, 311 F.3d
1054, 1059 [**1177]  (CA10 2002).  The District Court found against the Tribes.
Cherokee Nation of Okla. v. United States, 190 F. Supp. 2d 1248 (ED Okla. 2001).
And the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.  311 F.3d 1054 (2002).

In the second case, the Cherokee Nation submitted claims to the Department of
the Interior.  See App. 229-230.  A contracting officer denied the claims; the
Board of Contract Appeals reversed this ruling, ordering the Government to pay
$8.5 million  [***74]  in damages. Cherokee Nation of Okla., 1999-2 BCA P 30,462
, p 150488; App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 03-853, pp 38a-40a.  The Government
sought judicial review in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  The
Federal Circuit affirmed the Board's determination for the Tribe.  Thompson v.
Cherokee Nation of Okla., 334 F.3d 1075 (2003).

In light of the identical nature of the claims in the two cases and the opposite
results that the two Courts of Appeals have reached, we granted certiorari.  We
now affirm the Federal Circuit's judgment in favor of the Cherokee Nation, and
we reverse the Tenth Circuit's judgment in favor of the Government.

II

The Government does not deny that it promised to pay the relevant contract
support costs.  Nor does it deny that it failed to pay.  Its sole defense
consists of the argument that it is legally bound by its promises if, and only
if, Congress appropriated sufficient funds, and that, in this instance, Congress
failed to do so.

The Government in effect concedes yet more.  It does not deny that, were these
contracts ordinary procurement contracts, its promises to pay would be legally
binding. The  [*637]  Tribes point out that each year Congress appropriated far
more than the amounts here at issue (between $1.277 billion and $1.419 billion)
for the Indian Health Service ""to carry out,"" inter alia, ""the Indian
Self-Determination Act."" See 107 Stat. 1408 (1993); 108 Stat. 2527-2528 (1994);
110 Stat. 1321-189 (1996); id., at 3009-212 to 3009-213 (1996).  These
appropriations Acts contained no relevant statutory restriction.

The Tribes (and their amici) add, first, that this Court has said that  [HN3]


     ""a fundamental principle of appropriations law is that where Congress
     merely appropriates lump-sum amounts without statutorily restricting
     what can be done with those funds, a clear inference arises that it
     does not intend to impose legally binding restrictions, and indicia in
     committee reports and other legislative history as to how the funds
     should or are expected to be spent do not establish any legal
     requirements on the agency.""  Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 192, 124
     L. Ed. 2d 101, 113 S. Ct. 2024 (1993) (internal quotation marks
     omitted).



See also  Int'l Union, UAW v. Donovan, 746 F.2d 855, 860-861 (CADC 1984)
(Scalia, J.);  Blackhawk Heating & Plumbing Co. v. United States, 622 F.2d 539,
and n. 9, 224 Ct. Cl. 111, and n. 9, 135 (1980).

The Tribes and their amici add, second, that as long as Congress has
appropriated sufficient legally unrestricted funds to pay the contracts at
issue, the Government normally cannot back out of a promise to pay on grounds of
""insufficient appropriations,"" even if the contract uses language such as
""subject to the availability of appropriations,"" and even if an agency's total
lump-sum appropriation is insufficient to pay all the contracts the agency has
made.  See Ferris v. United States, 27 Ct. Cl. 542, 546 (1892)  [HN4] (""A
contractor who is one of [**1178]  several persons to be paid out  [*638]  of an
appropriation is not chargeable  [***75]  with knowledge of its administration,
nor can his legal rights be affected or impaired by its maladministration or by
its diversion, whether legal or illegal, to other objects""); see also Blackhawk,
supra, at 135, and n. 9, 622 F.2d, at 552, and n. 9

As we have said, the Government denies none of this.  Thus, if it is nonetheless
to demonstrate that its promises were not legally binding, it must show
something special about the promises here at issue.  That is precisely what the
Government here tries, but fails, to do.

A

The Government initially argues that the Act creates a special kind of
""self-determination contrac[t]"" with a ""unique, government-to-government nature""
that differentiates it from ""standard government procurement contracts."" Brief
for Federal Parties 4.  Because a tribe does not bargain with the Government at
arm's length, id., at 24, the law should charge it with knowledge that the
Government has entered into other, similar contracts with other tribes; the
tribe should bear the risk that a total lump-sum appropriation (though
sufficient to cover its own contracts) will not prove sufficient to pay all
similar contracts,  id., at 23-25.  Because such a tribe has elected to ""ste[p]
into the shoes of a federal agency,"" id., at 25, the law should treat it like an
agency; and an agency enjoys no legal entitlement to receive promised amounts
from Congress, id., at 24-25.  Rather, a tribe should receive only the portion
of the total lump-sum appropriation allocated to it, not the entire sum to which
a private contractor might well be entitled.  Id., at 24.

[***LEdHR1A]  The Government finds support for this special treatment of its
promises made pursuant to the Act by pointing to a statutory provision stating
that  [HN5] ""'no [self-determination] contract . . . shall be construed to be a
procurement contract,'"" id., at 23 (quoting 25 U.S.C. § 450b(j) [25 USCS §
450b(j)]; alterations in original).  It finds supplementary support in another
provision  [*639]  that says that  [HN6] a tribe need not deliver services ""'in
excess of the amount of funds awarded,'"" Brief for Federal Parties 24 (quoting
25 U.S.C. § 450l(c) [25 USCS § 450l(c)]; citing § 458aaa-7(k)).

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2] [2] These statutory provisions, in our view, fall
well short of providing the support the Government needs.  In general, the Act's
language runs counter to the Government's view.  That language strongly suggests
that Congress, in respect to the binding nature of a promise, meant to treat
alike promises made under the Act and ordinary contractual promises (say, those
made in procurement contracts).  The Act, for example, uses the word ""contract""
426 times to describe the nature of the Government's promise; and  [HN7] the
word ""contract"" normally refers to ""a promise or a set of promises for the
breach of which the law gives a remedy, or the performance of which the law in
some way recognizes as a duty,"" Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 1 (1979).
The Act also describes payment of contract support costs in a provision setting
forth a sample ""Contract."" 25 U.S.C. § 450l(c) [25 USCS § 450l(c)] (Model
Agreement §§ 1(a)(1), (b)(4)).  Further, the Act says that if the Government
refuses to pay, then contractors are entitled to ""money damages"" in accordance
with the Contract Disputes Act. 25 U.S.C. § 450m-1(a)[25 USCS  [***76]  §
450m-1(a)]; see also §§ 450m-1(d), 458cc(h).

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR3] [3] Neither do the Act's general purposes support any
special treatment.  [HN8] The Act seeks greater tribal self-reliance brought
about through more ""effective and meaningful participation by the Indian people""
in, and less ""Federal domination"" of, ""programs for, and services to, Indians.""
§ 450a(b). The Act also reflects a congressional [**1179]  concern with
Government's past failure adequately to reimburse tribes' indirect
administrative costs and a congressional decision to require payment of those
costs in the future.  See, e.g., § 450j-1(g); see also §§ 450j-1(a), (d)(2).

[***LEdHR1A]  The specific statutory language to which the Government
points--stating that tribes need not spend funds ""in excess of the amount of
funds awarded,"" § 450l(c) (Model Agreement  [*640]  § 1(b)(5))--does not help
the Government.  Cf. Brief for Federal Parties 18.  This kind of statement often
appears in ordinary procurement contracts.  See, e.g., 48 CFR § 52.232-20(d)(2)
(2004) (sample ""Limitation of Cost"" clause); see generally W. Keyes, Government
Contracts Under the Federal Acquisition Regulation § 32.38, p 724 (3d ed. 2003).
Nor can the Government find adequate support in the statute's statement that ""no
[self-determination] contract . . . shall be construed to be a procurement
contract."" 25 U.S.C. § 450b(j) [25 USCS § 450b(j)].  In context, that statement
seems designed to relieve tribes and the Government of the technical burdens
that often accompany procurement, not to weaken a contract's binding nature.
Cf. 41 CFR § 3-4.6001 (1976) (applying procurement rules to tribal contracts);
S. Rep. No. 100-274, p 7 (1987) (noting that application of procurement rules to
contracts with tribes ""resulted in excessive paperwork and unduly burdensome
reporting requirements""); id., at 18-19 (describing decision not to apply
procurement rules to tribal contracts as intended to ""greatly reduc[e]"" the
federal bureaucracy associated with them).  Finally, we have found no indication
that Congress believed or accepted the Government's current claim that, because
of mutual self-awareness among tribal contractors, tribes, not the Government,
should bear the risk that an unrestricted lump-sum appropriation would prove
insufficient to pay all contractors. Compare Brief for Federal Parties 23-24
with Ferris, 27 Ct. Cl., at 546.

B

The Government next points to an Act proviso, which states:


      [HN9] ""Notwithstanding any other provision in this subchapter, the
     provision of funds under this subchapter is [1] subject to the
     availability of appropriations and the Secretary [2] is not required
     to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a
     tribe to make  [*641]  funds available to another tribe or tribal
     organization under this subchapter."" 25 U.S.C. § 450j-1(b) [25 USCS §
     450j-1(b)] (emphasis and bracketed numbers added).



The Government believes that the two italicized phrases, taken separately or
together, render its promises nonbinding.

1

We begin with phrase [2].  This phrase, says the Government, makes nonbinding a
promise to pay one tribe's costs where doing so would  [***77]  require funds
that the Government would otherwise devote to ""programs, projects, or activities
serving . . . another tribe,"" ibid. See Brief for Federal Parties 27-36.  This
argument is inadequate, however, for at the least it runs up against the
fact--found by the Federal Circuit, see 334 F.3d, at 1093-1094, and nowhere here
denied--that the relevant congressional appropriations contained other
unrestricted funds, small in amount but sufficient to pay the claims at issue.
And as we have said,  supra, at 636-638, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 74-75, the Government
itself tells us that,  [HN10] in the case of ordinary contracts, say,
procurement contracts,


     ""if the amount of an unrestricted appropriation is sufficient to fund
     the contract, the contractor is entitled to payment even if the agency
     has allocated the [**1180]  funds to another purpose or assumes other
     obligations that exhaust the funds."" Brief for Federal Parties 23
     (emphasis added).



See,  e.g.,  Lincoln, 508 U.S., at 192, 124 L. Ed. 2d 101, 113 S. Ct. 2024;
Blackhawk, 224 Ct. Cl., at 135, and n. 9, 622 F.2d, at 552, and n. 9, Ferris,
supra, at 546.

The Government argues that these other funds, though legally unrestricted (as
far as the appropriations statutes' language is concerned) were nonetheless
unavailable to pay ""contract support costs"" because the Government had to use
those funds to satisfy a critically important need, namely, to pay the costs of
""inherent federal functions,"" such as the cost  [*642]  of running the Indian
Health Service's central Washington office.  Brief for Federal Parties 9-10,
27-34.  This argument cannot help the Government, however, for it amounts to no
more than a claim that the agency has allocated the funds to another purpose,
albeit potentially a very important purpose.  If an important alternative need
for funds cannot rescue the Government from the binding effect of its promises
where ordinary procurement contracts are at issue, it cannot rescue the
Government here, for we can find nothing special in the statute's language or in
the contracts.

The Government's best effort to find something special in the statutory language
is unpersuasive.  The Government points to language that forbids the Government
to enter into a contract with a tribe in which it promises to pay the tribe for
performing federal functions.  See 25 U.S.C. § 458aaa6-(c)(1)(A)(ii) [25 USCS §
458aaa-6(c)(1)(A)(ii)]; see also §§ 450f(a)(2)(E), 450j-1(a)(1), 450l(c) (Model
Agreement § 1(a)(2)).  Language of this kind, however, which forbids the
Government to contract for certain kinds of services, says nothing about the
source of funds used to pay for the supply of contractually legitimate
activities (and that is what is at issue here).

[***LEdHR4] [4] We recognize that agencies may sometimes find that they must
spend unrestricted appropriated funds to satisfy needs they believe more
important than fulfilling a contractual obligation.  But the law normally
expects the Government to avoid such situations, for example, by refraining from
making less essential contractual commitments; or by asking Congress in advance
to protect funds needed for more essential purposes with statutory earmarks; or
by seeking added funding from Congress; or, if necessary, by using unrestricted
funds for the more essential  [***78]  purpose while leaving the contractor free
to pursue appropriate legal remedies arising because the Government broke its
contractual promise.  See New York Airways, Inc. v. United States, 177 Ct. Cl.
800, 808-811, 369 F.2d 743, 747-748 (1966) (per curiam); 31 U.S.C. §§
1341(a)(1)(A) and (B) [31 USCS §§ 1341(a)(1)(A) and (B)] (Anti-Deficiency Act);
41 U.S.C. § 601 et seq [41 USCS §§ 601 et seq.] [*643]  (Contract Disputes Act);
31 U.S.C. § 1304 [31 USCS § 1304] (Judgment Fund); see generally 2 General
Accounting Office, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 6-17 to 6-19 (2d ed.
1992) (hereinafter GAO Redbook).  The Government, without denying that this is
so as a general matter of procurement law, says nothing to convince us that a
different legal rule should apply here.

2

[***LEdHR5] [5] Phrase [1] of the proviso says that the Government's provision
of funds under the Act is ""subject to the availability of appropriations."" 25
U.S.C. § 450j-1(b) [25 USCS § 450j-1(b)].  This language does not help the
Government either.  Language of this kind is often used with respect to
Government contracts.  See, e.g., 22 U.S.C. § 2716(a)(1) [22 USCS § 2716(a)(1)];
42 U.S.C. §§ 6249(b)(4) [42 USCS § 6249(b)(4)], 12206(d)(1).   [HN11] This kind
of language normally makes clear that an agency and a contracting party can
[**1181] negotiate a contract prior to the beginning of a fiscal year but that
the contract will not become binding unless and until Congress appropriates
funds for that year.  See, e.g.,  Blackhawk, supra, at 133-138, 622 F.2d, at
551-553; see generally 1 GAO Redbook 4-6 (3d ed. 2004); 2 id., at 6-6 to 6-8,
6-17 to 6-19 (2d ed. 1992).  It also makes clear that a Government contracting
officer lacks any special statutory authority needed to bind the Government
without regard to the availability of appropriations. See Ferris, 27 Ct. Cl., at
546; New York Airways, supra, at 809-813, 369 F.2d, at 748-749; Dougherty v.
United States, 18 Ct. Cl. 496, 503 (1883); 31 U.S.C. §§ 1341(a)(1)(A) and (B) [
31 USCS §§ 1341(a)(1)(A) and (B)] (providing that without some such special
authority, a contracting officer cannot bind the Government in the absence of an
appropriation).  Since Congress appropriated adequate unrestricted funds here,
phrase [1], if interpreted as ordinarily understood, would not help the
Government.

The Government again argues for a special interpretation.  It says the language
amounts to ""an affirmative grant of authority  [*644]  to the Secretary to
adjust funding levels based on appropriations."" Brief for Federal Parties 41
(emphasis in original).  In so arguing, the Government in effect claims (on the
basis of this language) to have the legal right to disregard its contractual
promises if, for example, it reasonably finds other, more important uses for an
otherwise adequate lump-sum appropriation.

[***LEdHR6] [6] In our view, however, the Government must again shoulder the
burden of explaining why, in the context of Government contracts, we should not
give this kind of statutory language its ordinary contract-related
interpretation, at least in the absence of a showing that Congress meant the
contrary.  We believe it important to provide a uniform interpretation of
similar language used in comparable statutes, lest legal uncertainty undermine
contractors' confidence that they will be paid, and in turn increase the cost to
the Government  [***79]  of purchasing goods and services.  See, e.g.,
Franconia Associates v. United States, 536 U.S. 129, 142, 153 L. Ed. 2d 132, 122
S. Ct. 1993 (2002); United States v. Winstar Corp., 518 U.S. 839, 884-885, 135
L. Ed. 2d 964, 116 S. Ct. 2432, and n. 29 (1996) (plurality opinion);  id., at
913, 135 L. Ed. 2d 964, 116 S. Ct. 2432 (Breyer, J., concurring); Lynch v.
United States, 292 U.S. 571, 580, 78 L. Ed. 1434, 54 S. Ct. 840 (1934).  The
Government, in our view, has provided no convincing argument for a special,
rather than ordinary, interpretation here.

The Government refers to legislative history, see Brief for Federal Parties
41-42 (citing, e.g., S. Rep. No. 100-274, at 48, 57), but that history shows
only that Executive Branch officials would have liked to exercise discretionary
authority to allocate a lump-sum appropriation too small to pay for all the
contracts that the Government had entered into; the history does not show that
Congress granted such authority.  Nor can we find sufficient support in the
other statutory provisions to which the Government points.  See 25 U.S.C. §
450j-1(c)(2) [25 USCS § 450j-1(c)(2)] (requiring the Government to report
underpayments of promised contract support costs); 107 Stat. 1408
(Appropriations Act for fiscal year FY 1994) (providing that $7.5 million
[*645]  for contract support costs in ""initial or expanded"" contracts ""shall
remain available"" until expended); 108 Stat. 2528 (same for FY 1995); 110 Stat.
1321-189 (same for FY 1996);  id ., at 3009-213 (same for FY 1997).  We cannot
adopt the Government's special interpretation of phrase [1] of the proviso.

C

[***LEdHR1A]  Finally, the Government points to a later enacted statute, § 314
of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999,
[**1182] which says:


      [HN12] ""Notwithstanding any other provision of law [the] amounts
     appropriated to or earmarked in committee reports for the . . . Indian
     Health Service . . . for payments to tribes . . . for contract support
     costs . . . are the total amounts available for fiscal years 1994
     through 1998 for such purposes."" 112 Stat. 2681-288 (emphasis added).



See Brief for Federal Parties 45-50.  The Government adds that congressional
Committee Reports ""earmarked,"" i.e., restricted, appropriations available to pay
""contract support costs"" in each of FYs 1994 through 1997.  Id., at 48.  And
those amounts have long since been spent.  See id., at 12.  Since those amounts
""are the total amounts available for"" payment of ""contract support costs,"" the
Government says, it is unlawful to pay the Tribes' claims.  Id., at 45-48.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR7] [7] The language in question is open to the
interpretation that it retroactively bars payment of claims arising under 1994
through 1997 contracts.  It is also open to another interpretation.  Just prior
to Congress' enactment of § 314, the Interior Department's Board of Contract
Appeals considered a case similar to the present ones and held that the
Government was legally bound to pay amounts it had promised in similar
contracts.  Alamo Navajo School Bd., Inc. and Miccosukee Corp., 1998-2 BCA P
29,831, p 147681 (1997), and P 29,832, p 147699 (1998). The Indian Health
Service  [***80]  contemporaneously issued a draft document that suggested the
[*646]  use of unspent funds appropriated in prior years to pay unpaid ""contract
support costs."" App. 206-209.  Indeed, the document referred to use of
unobligated funds from years including 1994 through 1997 to pay ""contract
support cost"" debts.  Id., at 206-207.  Section 314's language may be read as
simply forbidding the Service to use those left over funds for that purpose.

On the basis of language alone we would find either interpretation reasonable.
But there are other considerations.  The first interpretation would undo a
binding governmental contractual promise.   [HN13] A statute that retroactively
repudiates the Government's contractual obligation may violate the Constitution.
See, e.g.,  Winstar, supra, at 875-876, 135 L. Ed. 2d 964, 116 S. Ct. 2432
(plurality opinion); Perry v. United States, 294 U.S. 330, 350-351, 79 L. Ed.
912, 55 S. Ct. 432, 80 Ct. Cl. 861 (1935);  Lynch, supra, at 579-580, 78 L. Ed.
1434, 54 S. Ct. 840  United States v. Klein, 80 U.S. 128, 13 Wall. 128, 144-147,
20 L. Ed. 519, 7 Ct. Cl. 240 (1872); see also, e.g.,  Winstar, supra, at
884-885, and n 29, 135 L. Ed. 2d 964, 116 S. Ct. 2432 (plurality opinion)
(describing practical disadvantages flowing from governmental repudiation);
Lynch, supra, at 580, 78 L. Ed. 1434, 54 S. Ct. 840 (same).  And such an
interpretation is disfavored.  See Clark v. Martinez, ante, 380-382, 543 U.S.
371, 125 S. Ct. 716, 160 L. Ed. 2d 734 (2005); Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678,
689, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653, 121 S. Ct. 2491 (2001); Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v.
Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568, 575, 99 L.
Ed. 2d 645, 108 S. Ct. 1392 (1988).  This consideration tips the balance against
the retroactive interpretation.

[***LEdHR8] [8] The Government, itself not relying on either interpretation,
offers us a third.  It says that the statute simply clarifies earlier ambiguous
appropriations language that was wrongly read as unrestricted. Brief for Federal
Parties 48 (citing Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 380-381, 23
L. Ed. 2d 371, 89 S. Ct. 1794 (1969)). The earlier appropriations statutes,
however, were not ambiguous. The relevant case law makes clear that  [HN14]
restrictive language contained in Committee Reports is not legally binding. See,
e.g.,  Lincoln, 508 U.S., at 192, 124 L. Ed. 2d 101, 113 S. Ct. 2024;
International Union, 746 F.2d, at 860-861; Blackhawk, 224 Ct. Cl., at 135, and
n. 9, 622 F.2d, at 552, and n. 9 No other restrictive [**1183]  language exists.
The earlier appropriations statutes  [*647]  unambiguously provided unrestricted
lump-sum appropriations. We therefore cannot accept the Government's
interpretation of § 314.

[***LEdHR1A]  Hence we, like the Federal Circuit, are left with the second
interpretation, which we adopt, concluding that Congress intended it in the
circumstances.  See Zadvydas, supra, at 689, 150 L. Ed. 2d 653, 121 S. Ct. 2491;
cf. 334 F.3d, at 1092.  So interpreted, the provision does not bar recovery
here.

For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Federal Circuit; we reverse the
judgment of the Tenth Circuit; and we remand the cases for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

The Chief Justice took no part in the decision of these cases.  [***81]

I join the Court's opinion except its reliance,  ante, at 640, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at
76, on a Senate Committee Report to establish the meaning of the statute at
issue here.  That source at most indicates the intent of one Committee of one
Chamber of Congress--and realistically, probably not even that, since there is
no requirement that Committee members vote on, and small probability that they
even read, the entire text of a staff-generated report.  It is a legal fiction
to say that this expresses the intent of the United States Congress.  And it is
in any event not the inadequately expressed intent of the Congress, but the
meaning of what it enacted, that we should be looking for.  The only virtue of
this cited source (and its entire allure) is that it says precisely what the
Court wants.

 [*310]   [**2365]  Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A] The question is whether want of a federal cause of action to
try claims of title to land obtained at a federal tax sale precludes removal to
federal court of a state action with nondiverse parties raising a disputed issue
of federal title law.  We answer no, and hold that the national interest in
providing a federal forum for federal tax litigation is sufficiently substantial
to support the exercise of federal-question jurisdiction over the disputed issue
on removal, which would not distort any division of labor between the state and
federal courts, provided or assumed by Congress.

[**2366]  I

In 1994, the Internal Revenue Service seized Michigan real property belonging to
petitioner Grable & Sons Metal Products, Inc., to satisfy Grable's federal tax
delinquency.  Title 26 U.S.C. § 6335 required the IRS to give notice of the
seizure, and there is no dispute that Grable received actual notice by certified
mail before the IRS sold the property to respondent Darue Engineering &
Manufacturing.  Although Grable also received notice of the sale itself, it did
not exercise its statutory right to redeem the property within 180 days of the
sale, § 6337(b)(1), and after that period  [*311]  had passed, the Government
gave Darue a quitclaim deed,  § 6339.

Five years later, Grable brought a quiet title action in state court, claiming
that Darue's record title was invalid because the IRS had failed to notify
Grable of its seizure of the property in the exact manner required by § 6335(a),
which provides that written notice must be ""given by the Secretary to the owner
of the property [or] left at his usual place  [***263]  of abode or business.""
Grable said that the statute required personal service, not service by certified
mail.

Darue removed the case to Federal District Court as presenting a federal
question, because the claim of title depended on the interpretation of the
notice statute in the federal tax law.  The District Court declined to remand
the case at Grable's behest after finding that the ""claim does pose a
'significant question of federal law,'"" Tr. 17 (Apr. 2, 2001), and ruling that
Grable's lack of a federal right of action to enforce its claim against Darue
did not bar the exercise of federal jurisdiction. On the merits, the court
granted summary judgment to Darue, holding that although § 6335 by its terms
required personal service, substantial compliance with the statute was enough.
207 F. Supp. 2d 694 (WD Mich. 2002).

[***LEdHR1A] [1B]  [***LEdHR2A] [2A] The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
affirmed.   377 F.3d 592 (2004).  On the jurisdictional question, the panel
thought it sufficed that the title claim raised an issue of federal law that had
to be resolved, and implicated a substantial federal interest (in construing
federal tax law).  The court went on to affirm the District Court's judgment on
the merits.  We granted certiorari on the jurisdictional question alone, 1 543
U.S. 1042, 160 L. Ed. 2d 610, 125 S. Ct. 824 (2005), to resolve a split within
the Courts of Appeals on whether  Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson,
478 U.S. 804, 92 L. Ed. 2d 650, 106 S. Ct. 3229 (1986), always requires  [*312]
a federal cause of action as a condition for exercising federal-question
jurisdiction. 2 We now affirm.

[HN1]  [***LEdHR1A] [1C]  [***LEdHR2A] [2B]  [***LEdHR3A] [3A] Darue was
entitled to remove the quiet title action if Grable could have brought it in
federal district court originally, 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a), as a civil action
""arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States,"" § 1331
.   [HN2] This provision for federal-question jurisdiction is invoked by and
large by plaintiffs pleading a cause of action created by federal law (e.g.,
claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983).  There is, however, another longstanding, if
less frequently encountered, variety of federal ""arising under"" jurisdiction,
[**2367]  this Court having recognized for nearly 100 years that in certain
cases federal-question jurisdiction will lie over state-law claims that
implicate significant federal issues.  E.g.,  Hopkins v. Walker, 244 U.S. 486,
490-491, 61 L. Ed. 1270, 37 S. Ct. 711 (1917).  The doctrine captures the
commonsense notion that a federal court ought to be able to hear claims
recognized under state law that nonetheless turn on substantial questions of
federal law, and thus justify resort to the experience, solicitude, and hope of
uniformity that a federal forum offers on federal issues, see ALI, Study of the
Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts 164-166 (1968).

[***LEdHR3A] [3B] The classic example is  Smith  [***264]  v. Kansas City Title
& Trust Co., 255 U.S. 180, 65 L. Ed. 577, 41 S. Ct. 243 (1921), a suit by a
shareholder claiming that the defendant corporation could not lawfully buy
certain bonds of the National Government because their issuance was
unconstitutional.  Although Missouri law provided the cause of action, the Court
recognized federal-question jurisdiction because the principal issue in the case
was the federal constitutionality of the bond issue.  Smith thus held, in a
[*313]  somewhat generous statement of the scope of the doctrine, that a
state-law claim could give rise to federal-question jurisdiction so long as it
""appears from the [complaint] that the right to relief depends upon the
construction or application of [federal law].""  Id., at 199, 65 L. Ed. 577, 41
S. Ct. 243.

The Smith statement has been subject to some trimming to fit earlier and later
cases recognizing the vitality of the basic doctrine, but shying away from the
expansive view that mere need to apply federal law in a state-law claim will
suffice to open the ""arising under"" door.  As early as 1912, this Court had
confined federal-question jurisdiction over state-law claims to those that
""really and substantially involv[e] a dispute or controversy respecting the
validity, construction or effect of [federal] law.""  Shulthis v. McDougal, 225
U.S. 561, 569, 56 L. Ed. 1205, 32 S. Ct. 704.  This limitation was the ancestor
of Justice Cardozo's later explanation that a request to exercise
federal-question jurisdiction over a state action calls for a ""common-sense
accommodation of judgment to [the] kaleidoscopic situations"" that present a
federal issue, in ""a selective process which picks the substantial causes out of
the web and lays the other ones aside.""  Gully v. First Nat. Bank in Meridian,
299 U.S. 109, 117-118, 81 L. Ed. 70, 57 S. Ct. 96 (1936).  It has in fact become
a constant refrain in such cases that  [HN3] federal jurisdiction demands not
only a contested federal issue, but a substantial one, indicating a serious
federal interest in claiming the advantages thought to be inherent in a federal
forum. E.g.,  Chicago v. International College of Surgeons, 522 U.S. 156, 164,
139 L. Ed. 2d 525, 118 S. Ct. 523 (1997);  Merrell Dow, supra, at 814, n 12, 92
L. Ed. 2d 650, 106 S. Ct. 3229;  Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction
Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463 U.S. 1, 28, 77 L. Ed. 2d 420, 103
S. Ct. 2841 (1983).

[HN4] But even when the state action discloses a contested and substantial
federal question, the exercise of federal jurisdiction is subject to a possible
veto.  For the federal issue will ultimately qualify for a federal forum only if
federal jurisdiction is consistent with congressional judgment about the sound
division of labor between state and federal courts governing  [*314]  the
application of § 1331.  Thus, Franchise Tax Bd. explained that the
appropriateness of a federal forum to hear an embedded issue could be evaluated
only after considering the ""welter of issues regarding the interrelation of
federal and state authority and the proper management of the federal judicial
system.""  Id., at 8, 77 L. Ed. 2d 420, 103 S. Ct. 2841.  Because arising-under
jurisdiction to hear [**2368]  a state-law claim always raises the possibility
of upsetting the state-federal line drawn (or at least assumed) by Congress, the
presence of a disputed federal issue and the ostensible importance of a federal
forum are never necessarily dispositive;  [***265]  there must always be an
assessment of any disruptive portent in exercising federal jurisdiction. See
also Merrell Dow, 478 U.S. 810, 92 L. Ed. 2d 650, 106 S. Ct. 3229.

[HN5] These considerations have kept us from stating a ""single, precise,
all-embracing"" test for jurisdiction over federal issues embedded in state-law
claims between nondiverse parties.   Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating
Corp., 486 U.S. 800, 821, 100 L. Ed. 2d 811, 108 S. Ct. 2166 (1988) (Stevens,
J., concurring).  We have not kept them out simply because they appeared in
state raiment, as Justice Holmes would have done, see  Smith, supra, at 214, 65
L. Ed. 577, 41 S. Ct. 243 (dissenting opinion), but neither have we treated
""federal issue"" as a password opening federal courts to any state action
embracing a point of federal law. Instead, the question is, does a state-law
claim necessarily raise a stated federal issue, actually disputed and
substantial, which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any
congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.

A

[***LEdHR1A] [1D] This case warrants federal jurisdiction. Grable's state
complaint must specify ""the facts establishing the superiority of [its] claim,""
Mich. Ct. Rule 3.411(B)(2)(c) (West 2005), and Grable has premised its superior
title claim on a failure by the IRS to give it adequate notice, as defined by
federal  [*315]  law. Whether Grable was given notice within the meaning of the
federal statute is thus an essential element of its quiet title claim, and the
meaning of the federal statute is actually in dispute; it appears to be the only
legal or factual issue contested in the case.  The meaning of the federal tax
provision is an important issue of federal law that sensibly belongs in a
federal court.  The Government has a strong interest in the ""prompt and certain
collection of delinquent taxes,""  United States v. Rodgers, 461 U.S. 677, 709,
76 L. Ed. 2d 236, 103 S. Ct. 2132 (1983), and the ability of the IRS to satisfy
its claims from the property of delinquents requires clear terms of notice to
allow buyers like Darue to satisfy themselves that the Service has touched the
bases necessary for good title.  The Government thus has a direct interest in
the availability of a federal forum to vindicate its own administrative action,
and buyers (as well as tax delinquents) may find it valuable to come before
judges used to federal tax matters.  Finally, because it will be the rare state
title case that raises a contested matter of federal law, federal jurisdiction
to resolve genuine disagreement over federal tax title provisions will portend
only a microscopic effect on the federal-state division of labor. See n. 3,
infra.

[***LEdHR1A] [1E]  [***LEdHR3A] [3C] This conclusion puts us in venerable
company, quiet title actions having been the subject of some of the earliest
exercises of federal-question jurisdiction over state-law claims.  In  Hopkins,
244 U.S., at 490-491, 61 L. Ed. 1270, 37 S. Ct. 711, the question was federal
jurisdiction over a quiet title action based on the plaintiffs' allegation that
federal mining law gave them the superior claim.  Just as in this case, ""the
facts showing the plaintiffs' title and the existence and invalidity of the
instrument or record sought to be eliminated as a cloud upon the title are
[***266]  essential parts of the [**2369]  plaintiffs' cause of action."" 3 Id.,
at 490, 61 L. Ed. 1270, 37 S. Ct. 711.   [*316]  As in this case again, ""it is
plain that a controversy respecting the construction and effect of the [federal]
laws is involved and is sufficiently real and substantial.""  Id.,at 489, 61 L.
Ed. 1270, 37 S. Ct. 711.  This Court therefore upheld federal jurisdiction in
Hopkins, as well as in the similar quiet title matters of  Northern Pacific R.
Co. v. Soderberg, 188 U.S. 526, 528, 47 L. Ed. 575, 23 S. Ct. 365 (1903), and
Wilson Cypress Co. v. Del Pozo y Marcos, 236 U.S. 635, 643-644, 59 L. Ed. 758,
35 S. Ct. 446 (1915).  Consistent with those cases, the recognition of federal
jurisdiction is in order here.

3  [***LEdHR3A] [3D] The quiet title cases also show the limiting effect of the
requirement that the federal issue in a state-law claim must actually be in
dispute to justify federal-question jurisdiction.  In  Shulthis v. McDougal, 225
U.S. 561, 56 L. Ed. 1205, 32 S. Ct. 704 (1912), this Court found that there was
no federal-question jurisdiction to hear a plaintiff's quiet title claim in part
because the federal statutes on which title depended were not subject to ""any
controversy respecting their validity, construction, or effect.""  Id., at 570,
56 L. Ed. 1205, 32 S. Ct. 704.  As the Court put it, the requirement of an
actual dispute about federal law was ""especially"" important in ""suit[s]
involving rights to land acquired under a law of the United States,"" because
otherwise ""every suit to establish title to land in the central and western
states would so arise [under federal law], as all titles in those States are
traceable back to those laws.""  Id., at 569-570, 56 L. Ed. 1205, 32 S. Ct. 704.

[***LEdHR1A] [1F]  [***LEdHR2A] [2C]  Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v.
Thompson, 478 U.S. 804, 92 L. Ed. 2d 650, 106 S. Ct. 3229 (1986), on which
Grable rests its position, is not to the contrary.  Merrell Dow considered a
state tort claim resting in part on the allegation that the defendant drug
company had violated a federal misbranding prohibition, and was thus
presumptively negligent under Ohio law.   Id., at 806, 92 L. Ed. 2d 650, 106 S.
Ct. 3229.  The Court assumed that federal law would have to be applied to
resolve the claim, but after closely examining the strength of the federal
interest at stake and the implications of opening the federal forum, held
federal jurisdiction unavailable.  Congress had not provided a private federal
cause of action for violation of the federal branding requirement, and the Court
found ""it would . . . flout, or at least undermine, congressional intent to
conclude that federal courts might nevertheless exercise federal-question
jurisdiction and provide remedies for violations of that federal statute solely
because the violation . . . is said to be a . . . 'proximate cause' under state
law.""  Id., at 812, 92 L. Ed. 2d 650, 106 S. Ct. 3229.

[*317]   [***LEdHR1A] [1G]  [***LEdHR2A] [2D]  [***LEdHR3A] [3E]  [***LEdHR4A]
[4A]  [***LEdHR5] [5] Because federal law provides for no quiet title action
that could be brought against Darue,  4 Grable argues that there can be no
federal jurisdiction here, stressing some broad language in Merrell Dow
(including the passage just quoted) that on its face supports Grable's position,
see Note, Mr. Smith Goes to Federal Court: Federal Question Jurisdiction over
State Law Claims Post-Merrell Dow,  115 Harv. L. Rev. 2272, 2280-2282 (2002)
(discussing split in Courts of Appeals over private right of action requirement
[***267]  after Merrell Dow).  But  [HN6] an opinion is to be read as a whole,
and Merrell Dow cannot be read whole as overturning decades of precedent, as it
would have done by effectively adopting the Holmes dissent in Smith, see supra,
at 314, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 265, and converting a federal cause of action from a
sufficient condition  [**2370] for federal-question jurisdiction 5 into a
necessary one.

4  [***LEdHR4A] [4B] Federal law does provide a quiet title cause of action
against the Federal Government.  28 U.S.C. § 2410.  That right of action is not
relevant here, however, because the Federal Government no longer has any
interest in the property, having transferred its interest to Darue through the
quitclaim deed.

5 For an extremely rare exception to the sufficiency of a federal right of
action, see  Shoshone Mining Co. v. Rutter, 177 U.S. 505, 507, 44 L. Ed. 864, 20
S. Ct. 726 (1900).
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 [***LEdHR2A] [2E] In the first place, Merrell Dow disclaimed the adoption of
any bright-line rule, as when the Court reiterated that ""in exploring the outer
reaches of § 1331, determinations about federal jurisdiction require sensitive
judgments about congressional intent, judicial power, and the federal system.""
478 U.S., at 810, 92 L. Ed. 2d 650, 106 S. Ct. 3229.  The opinion included a
lengthy footnote explaining that questions of jurisdiction over state-law claims
require ""careful judgments,""  id., at 814, 92 L. Ed. 2d 650, 106 S. Ct. 3229,
about the ""nature of the federal interest at stake,""  id.,  at 814, n. 12, 92 L.
Ed. 2d 650, 106 S. Ct. 3229 (emphasis deleted).  And as a final indication that
it did not mean to make a federal right of action mandatory, it expressly
approved the exercise of jurisdiction sustained in Smith, despite the want of
any federal cause of action available to Smith's shareholder plaintiff.   478
U.S., at 814, n. 12, 92 L. Ed. 2d 650, 106 S. Ct. 3229 .   [*318]  Merrell Dow
then, did not toss out,  but specifically retained, the contextual enquiry that
had been Smith's hallmark for over 60 years.  At the end of Merrell Dow, Justice
Holmes was still dissenting.

Accordingly, Merrell Dow should be read in its entirety as treating the absence
of a federal private right of action as evidence relevant to, but not
dispositive of, the ""sensitive judgments about congressional intent"" that § 1331
requires.  The absence of any federal cause of action affected Merrell Dow's
result two ways.  The Court saw the fact as worth some consideration in the
assessment of substantiality.  But its primary importance emerged when the Court
treated the combination of no federal cause of action and no preemption of state
remedies for misbranding as an important clue to Congress's conception of the
scope of jurisdiction to be exercised under § 1331.  The Court saw the missing
cause of action not as a missing federal door key, always required, but as a
missing welcome mat, required in the circumstances, when exercising federal
jurisdiction over a state misbranding action would have attracted a horde of
original filings and removal cases raising other state claims with embedded
federal issues.  For if the federal labeling standard without a federal cause of
action could get a state claim into federal court, so could any other federal
standard without a federal cause of action. And that would have meant a
tremendous number of cases.

One only needed to consider the treatment of federal violations generally in
garden variety state tort law.  ""The violation of federal statutes and  [***268]
regulations is commonly given negligence per se effect in state tort
proceedings."" 6 Restatement  [*319]  (Third) of Torts § 14 Reporters' Note,
Comment a, p. 195 (Tent. Draft No. 1, March 28, 2001. See also W. Keeton, D.
Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts § 36, p. 221, n.
9 (5th ed. 1984) (""[T]he breach of a federal statute may support a negligence
per se claim as a matter of state law"" (collecting authority)).  A general rule
of exercising federal jurisdiction over state claims resting on federal
mislabeling and other statutory violations would thus have heralded a
potentially  [**2371] enormous shift of traditionally state cases into federal
courts.  Expressing concern over the ""increased volume of federal litigation,""
and noting the importance of adhering to ""legislative intent,"" Merrell Dow
thought it improbable that the Congress, having made no provision for a federal
cause of action, would have meant to welcome any state-law tort case implicating
federal law ""solely because the violation of the federal statute is said to
[create] a rebuttable presumption [of negligence] . . . under state law.""  478
U.S., at 811-812, 92 L. Ed. 2d 650, 106 S. Ct. 3229 (internal quotation marks
omitted).  In this situation, no welcome mat meant keep out.  Merrell Dow's
analysis thus fits within the framework of examining the importance of having a
federal forum for the issue, and the consistency of such a forum with Congress's
intended division of labor between state and federal courts.

6 Other jurisdictions treat a violation of a federal statute as evidence of
negligence or, like Ohio itself in  Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v.
Thompson, 478 U.S. 804, 92 L. Ed. 2d 650, 106 S. Ct. 3229 (1986), as creating a
rebuttable presumption of negligence.  Restatement § 14, Reporters' Note,
Comment c., at 196. Either approach could still implicate issues of federal law.

  [***LEdHR1A] [1H]  [***LEdHR6A] [6A] As already indicated, however, a
comparable analysis yields a different jurisdictional conclusion in this case.
Although Congress also indicated ambivalence in this case by providing no
private right of action to Grable, it is the rare state quiet title action that
involves contested issues of federal law, see n. 3, supra. Consequently,
jurisdiction over actions like Grable's would not materially affect, or threaten
to affect, the normal currents of litigation.  Given the absence of threatening
structural consequences and the clear interest the Government, its buyers, and
its delinquents have in the availability of a federal forum, there is no good
reason to  [*320]  shirk from federal jurisdiction over the dispositive and
contested federal issue at the heart of the state-law title claim. 7

7  [***LEdHR1A] [1I]  [***LEdHR6A] [6B] At oral argument Grable's counsel
espoused the position that after Merrell Dow, federal-question jurisdiction over
state-law claims absent a federal right of action could be recognized only where
a constitutional issue was at stake.  There is, however, no reason in text or
otherwise to draw such a rough line.  As Merrell Dow itself suggested,
constitutional questions may be the more likely ones to reach the level of
substantiality that can justify federal jurisdiction.  478 U.S., at 814, n. 12,
92 L. Ed. 2d 650, 206 S. Ct. 3229.  But a flat ban on statutory questions would
mechanically exclude significant questions of federal law like the one this case
presents.

[***LEdHR1A] [1J] The judgment of the Court of Appeals, upholding federal
jurisdiction over Grable's quiet title action, is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

 [***269]  Justice Thomas, concurring.

The Court faithfully applies our precedents interpreting 28 U.S.C. § 1331 to
authorize federal-court jurisdiction over some cases in which state law creates
the cause of action but requires determination of an issue of federal law, e.g.,
Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., 255 U.S. 180, 65 L. Ed. 577, 41 S. Ct.
243 (1921);  Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U.S. 804, 92 L.
Ed. 2d 650, 106 S. Ct. 3229 (1986).  In this case, no one has asked us to
overrule those precedents and adopt the rule Justice Holmes set forth in
American Well Works Co. v. Layne & Bowler Co., 241 U.S. 257, 60 L. Ed. 987, 36
S. Ct. 585 (1916), limiting § 1331 jurisdiction to cases in which federal law
creates the cause of action pleaded on the face of the plaintiff's complaint.
Id., at 260, 60 L. Ed. 2d 987, 36 S. Ct. 585.  In an appropriate case, and
perhaps with the benefit of better evidence as to the original meaning of § 1331
's text, I would be willing to consider that course. *

* This Court has long construed the scope of the statutory grant of
federal-question jurisdiction more narrowly than the scope of the constitutional
grant of such jurisdiction.  See  Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson,
478 U.S. 804, 807-808, 92 L. Ed. 2d 650, 106 S. Ct. 3229 (1986).  I assume for
present purposes that this distinction is proper--that is, that the language of
28 U.S.C. § 1331, ""[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all
civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United
States"" (emphasis added), is narrower than the language of Art. III, § 2, cl. 1,
of the Constitution, ""[t]he judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and
Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and
Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority . . ."" (emphasis
added).

  [*321]   [**2372]  Jurisdictional rules should be clear.  Whatever the virtues
of the Smith standard, it is anything but clear.   Ante, at 313, 162 L. Ed. 2d,
at 264 (the standard ""calls for a 'common-sense accommodation of judgment to
[the] kaleidoscopic situations' that present a federal issue, in 'a selective
process which picks the substantial causes out of the web and lays the other
ones aside'"" (quoting  Gully v. First Nat. Bank in Meridian, 299 U.S. 109,
117-118, 81 L. Ed. 70, 57 S. Ct. 96 (1936)));  ante, at 314, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at
265 (""[T]he question is, does a state-law claim necessarily raise a stated
federal issue, actually disputed and substantial, which a federal forum may
entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and
state judicial responsibilities""); ante, at 317, 318, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 267
(""'[D]eterminations about federal jurisdiction require sensitive judgments about
congressional intent, judicial power, and the federal system'""; ""the absence of
a federal private right of action [is] evidence relevant to, but not dispositive
of, the 'sensitive judgments about congressional intent' that § 1331 requires""
(quoting  Merrell Dow, supra, at 810, 92 L. Ed. 650, 106 S. Ct. 3229)).

Whatever the vices of the American Well Works rule, it is clear.  Moreover, it
accounts for the ""'vast majority'"" of cases that come within § 1331 under our
current case law,  Merrell Dow, supra, at 808, 92 L. Ed. 2d 650, 106 S. Ct. 3229
(quoting  Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for
Southern Cal., 463 U.S. 1, 9, 77 L. Ed. 2d 420, 103 S. Ct. 2841 (1983))
--further indication that trying to sort  [***270]  out which cases fall within
the smaller Smith category may not be worth the effort it entails.  See R.
Fallon, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The Federal  [*322]
Courts and the Federal System 885-886 (5th ed. 2003).  Accordingly, I would be
willing in appropriate circumstances to reconsider our interpretation of § 1331.

 [*3]  [**1233]   Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A] In Totten v. United States, 92 U.S. 105, 23 L. Ed. 605 (1876),
we held that public policy forbade a self-styled Civil War spy from suing the
United States to enforce its obligations under their secret espionage agreement.
Respondents here, alleged former Cold War spies, filed suit against the United
States and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), asserting
estoppel and due process claims for the CIA's alleged failure to provide
respondents with the assistance it had promised in return for their espionage
services.  Finding that Totten did not bar respondents' suit, the District Court
and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the case could proceed.
We reverse because this holding contravenes the longstanding rule, announced
more than a century ago in Totten, prohibiting suits against the Government
based on covert espionage agreements.

[***LEdHR2A] [2A] Respondents, a husband and wife who use the fictitious names
John and Jane Doe, brought suit in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Washington. 1 According to respondents,  they were formerly
citizens of a foreign country that at the time was considered to be an enemy of
the United States, and John Doe was a high-ranking diplomat for the country.
After respondents expressed interest in defecting to the United States, CIA
agents persuaded them to remain at their posts and conduct espionage for the
[*4]  United States for a specified period of time, promising in return that the
Government ""would arrange for travel to the United States and ensure financial
and personal security for life."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 122a.  After ""carrying
out their end of the bargain"" by completing years of purportedly high-risk,
valuable  [***88]  espionage services, id., at 123a, respondents defected (under
new names and false backgrounds) and became United States citizens, with the
Government's help.  The CIA designated respondents with ""PL-110"" status and
began providing financial assistance and personal security. 2

1 The Government has neither confirmed nor denied any of respondents'
allegations.  We therefore describe the facts as asserted in respondents' second
amended complaint.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 128a-136a.  They are, of course,
no more than allegations.

2  [***LEdHR2A] [2B] While the Government neither confirms nor denies that
respondents are part of any ""PL-110"" program, the parties agree this reference
is to 50 U.S.C. § 403h [50 USCS § 403h], a provision enacted as part of the
Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949, § 8, 63 Stat 212 (renumbered § 7, 72
Stat 337).  This provision allows a limited number of aliens and members of
their immediate families per year to be admitted to the United States for
permanent residence, regardless of their admissibility under the immigration
laws, upon a determination by the Director of the CIA, the Attorney General, and
the Commissioner of Immigration that admission of the particular alien ""is in
the interest of national security or essential to the furtherance of the
national intelligence mission."" § 403h.  However, nothing in this statute, nor
anything in the redacted CIA regulations and related materials respondents cite,
see Brief for Respondents 41-43; App. to Brief in Opposition 41-50, represents
an enforceable legal commitment by the CIA to provide support to spies that may
be admitted into the United States under § 403h.  See also App. to Pet. for
Cert. 145a (decl. of William McNair P 5 (Information Review Officer for the
CIA's Directorate of Operations) (stating, based on his search of regulations
and internal CIA policies, that he ""can inform the court unequivocally that
there are no Agency or other US federal regulations that require the CIA to
provide lifetime subsistence assistance to individuals brought into the United
States under the authority of PL-110"" (emphasis in original))).

 [**1234]   With the CIA's help, respondent John Doe obtained employment in the
State of Washington.  As his salary increased, the CIA decreased his living
stipend until, at some point, he agreed to a discontinuation of benefits while
he was working.  Years later, in 1997, John Doe was laid off after a corporate
merger.  Because John Doe was unable to find new employment as a result of CIA
restrictions on the type  [*5]  of jobs he could hold, respondents contacted the
CIA for financial assistance. 3 Denied such assistance by the CIA, they claim
they are unable to properly provide for themselves.  Thus, they are faced with
the prospect of either returning to their home country (where they say they face
extreme sanctions), or remaining in the United States in their present
circumstances.

3 Respondents document their alleged series of contacts with the CIA.  See id.,
at 128a-136a (Second Amended Complaint).  For instance, respondents allegedly
received a letter from the CIA in June 1997, expressing regret that the agency
no longer had funds available to provide assistance.  Id., at 128a.  Later,
respondents claim they were told the agency determined ""the benefits previously
provided were adequate for the services rendered."" Id., at 129a.  Although the
CIA apparently did not disclose to respondents the agency's appeals process,
respondents were permitted to appeal the initial determination both to the
Director of the CIA and to a panel of former agency officials called the Helms
Panel; both appeals were denied.  Id., at 129a-132a.

 Respondents assert, among other things, that the CIA violated their procedural
and substantive due process rights by denying them support and by failing to
provide them with a fair internal process for reviewing their claims.  They seek
injunctive relief ordering the CIA to resume monthly financial support pending
further agency review.  They also request a declaratory judgment stating that
the CIA failed to provide a constitutionally adequate review process, and
detailing the minimal process the agency must provide.  Finally, respondents
seek a mandamus order requiring the CIA to adopt agency procedures, to give them
fair review, and to provide them with security and financial assistance.

[***89]  The Government moved to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), principally on the ground that Totten
bars respondents' suit.  The District Court dismissed some of respondents'
claims but denied the Government's Totten objection, ruling that the due process
claims could proceed.  99 F. Supp. 2d 1284, 1289-1294 (W.D. Wash. 2000).  After
minimal discovery, the Government  [*6]  renewed its motion to dismiss based on
Totten, and it moved for summary judgment on respondents' due process claims.
Apparently construing the complaint as also raising an estoppel claim, the
District Court denied the Government's [**1235]  motions, ruled again that
Totten did not bar respondents' claims, and found there were genuine issues of
material fact warranting a trial on respondents' due process and estoppel
claims.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 85a-94a.  The District Court certified an order
for interlocutory appeal and stayed further proceedings pending appeal.  Id., at
79a-83a.

[***LEdHR3A] [3A] A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
affirmed in relevant part.  329 F.3d 1135 (2003).  It reasoned that Totten posed
no bar to reviewing some of respondents' claims and thus that the case could
proceed to trial, subject to the Government's asserting the evidentiary state
secrets privilege and the District Court's resolving that issue.  329 F.3d, at
1145-1155.  Over dissent, the Court of Appeals denied a petition for rehearing
en banc.  353 F.3d 1141 (CA9 2004).  The Government sought review, and we
granted certiorari. 4  542 U.S. 936, 159 L. Ed. 2d 811, 124 S. Ct. 2908 (2004).

[***LEdHR3A] [3B] Preliminarily, we must address whether Steel Co. v. Citizens
for Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210, 118 S. Ct. 1003 (1998),
prevents us from resolving this case based on the Totten issue.  In Steel Co.,
we adhered to the requirement that a court address questions pertaining to its
or a lower court's jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits.  523 U.S., at
94-95, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210, 118 S. Ct. 1003.  In the lower courts, in addition to
relying on Totten, the Government argued that the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. §
1491(a)(1) [28 USCS § 1491(a)(1)], required that respondents' claims be brought
in the Court of Federal Claims, rather than in the District Court.  The District
Court and the Court of Appeals rejected this argument, and the Government did
not seek review on this question in its petition for certiorari.  Pet. for Cert.
8, n 2.

We may assume for purposes of argument that this Tucker Act question is the kind
of jurisdictional issue that Steel Co. directs must be resolved before
addressing the merits of a claim.  Cf. United States v. Mitchell, 463 U.S. 206,
212, 215, 77 L. Ed. 2d 580, 103 S. Ct. 2961 (1983) (holding that ""the Tucker Act
effects a waiver of sovereign immunity"" and observing that ""the existence of
consent [to be sued] is a prerequisite for jurisdiction"").  Nevertheless,
application of the Totten rule of dismissal, like the abstention doctrine of
Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 27 L. Ed. 2d 669, 91 S. Ct. 746 (1971), or the
prudential standing doctrine, represents the sort of ""threshold question"" we
have recognized may be resolved before addressing jurisdiction.  See Ruhrgas AG
v. Marathon Oil Co., 526 U.S. 574, 585, 143 L. Ed. 2d 760, 119 S. Ct. 1563
(1999) (""It is hardly novel for a federal court to choose among threshold
grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits""); see also Kowalski v.
Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 129, 160 L. Ed. 2d 519, 125 S. Ct. 564 (2004) (assuming
Article III standing in order to ""address the alternative threshold question
whether"" attorneys had third-party standing); Steel Co., supra, at 100, n. 3,
140 L. Ed. 2d 210, 118 S. Ct. 1003 (approving a decision resolving Younger
abstention before addressing subject-matter jurisdiction).  It would be
inconsistent with the unique and categorical nature of the Totten bar--a rule
designed not merely to defeat the asserted claims, but to preclude judicial
inquiry--to first allow discovery or other proceedings in order to resolve the
jurisdictional question. Thus, whether or not the Government was permitted to
waive the Tucker Act question, we may dismiss respondents' cause of action on
the ground that it is barred by Totten.

  [*7]  In Totten, the administrator of William A. Lloyd's estate brought suit
against the United States to recover compensation for services that Lloyd
allegedly rendered as a spy during the Civil War. 92 U.S. 105, 23 L. Ed. 605.
Lloyd purportedly entered into a contract with President Lincoln in July 1861 to
spy behind Confederate lines on troop placement and fort plans, for which he was
to be paid $200 a month.  Id., at 105-106, 23 L. Ed. 605.  The lower court had
found that Lloyd performed on the contract but did not receive full
compensation.  Id., at 106, 23 L. Ed. 605.  After concluding with ""no
difficulty,"" ibid., that the President had the authority to bind the United
States to contracts with secret agents, we observed that the very essence of the
alleged contract [**1236]  between Lloyd and the Government was that it was
secret, and had to remain so:


     ""The service stipulated by the contract was a secret service; the
     information sought was to be obtained clandestinely, and was to be
     communicated privately; the employment and the service were to be
     equally concealed.  Both employer and agent must have understood that
     the lips of the other were to be for ever sealed respecting the
     relation of either to the matter.  This  [*8]  condition of the
     engagement was implied from the nature of the employment, and is
     implied in all secret employments of the government in time of war, or
     upon matters affecting our foreign relations, where a disclosure of
     the service might compromise or embarrass our government in its public
     duties, or endanger the person or injure the character of the agent.""
     Ibid.



Thus, we thought it entirely incompatible with the nature of such a contract
that a former spy could bring suit to enforce it.  Id., at 106-107, 23 L. Ed.
605.

[***LEdHR1A] [1B] We think the Court of Appeals was quite wrong in holding that
Totten does not require dismissal of respondents' claims.  That court, and
respondents here, reasoned first that Totten developed merely a contract rule,
prohibiting breach-of-contract claims seeking to enforce the terms of espionage
agreements but not barring claims based on due process or estoppel theories.  In
fact, Totten was not so limited:  [HN1] ""[P]ublic policy forbids the maintenance
of any suit in a court of justice, the trial of which would inevitably lead to
the disclosure of matters which the law itself regards as confidential.""  Id.,
at 107, 23 L. Ed. 605 (emphasis added); see also ibid. (""The secrecy which such
contracts impose precludes any action for their enforcement"" (emphasis added)).
No matter the clothing in which alleged spies dress their claims, Totten
precludes judicial review in cases such as respondents' where success depends
upon the existence of their secret espionage relationship with the Government.

Relying mainly on United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1, 97 L. Ed. 727, 73 S.
Ct. 528 (1953), the Court of Appeals also claimed that Totten has been recast
simply as an early expression of the evidentiary ""state secrets"" privilege,
rather than a categorical bar to their claims.  Reynolds involved a
wrongful-death action brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. §
1346 [28 USCS § 1346], by the widows of three civilians who died in the crash of
a military B-29 aircraft.  345 U.S., at 2-3, 97 L. Ed. 727, 73 S. Ct. 528.  In
the course  [***91]  of discovery, the plaintiffs sought certain
investigation-related  [*9]  documents, which the Government said contained
""'highly secret,'"" privileged military information.  Id., at 3-4, 97 L. Ed. 727,
73 S. Ct. 528.  We recognized ""the privilege against revealing military secrets,
a privilege which is well established in the law of evidence,"" id., at 6-7, 97
L. Ed. 727, 73 S. Ct. 528, and we set out a balancing approach for courts to
apply in resolving Government claims of privilege, id., at 7-11, 97 L. Ed. 727,
73 S. Ct. 528.  We ultimately concluded that the Government was entitled to the
privilege in that case.  Id., at 10-12, 97 L. Ed. 727, 73 S. Ct. 528.

When invoking the ""well established"" state secrets privilege, we indeed looked
to Totten.   Reynolds, supra, at 7, n. 11, 97 L. Ed. 727, 73 S. Ct. 528 (citing
Totten, supra, at 107, 23 L. Ed. 605).  See also Brief for United States in
United States v Reynolds, O. T. 1952, No. 21, pp 36, 42 (citing Totten in
support of a military secrets privilege).  But that in no way signaled our
retreat from Totten's broader holding that lawsuits premised on alleged
espionage agreements are altogether forbidden.  Indeed, our opinion in Reynolds
refutes this very suggestion: Citing Totten as a case ""where the very subject
matter [**1237]  of the action, a contract to perform espionage, was a matter of
state secret,"" we declared that such a case was to be ""dismissed on the
pleadings without ever reaching the question of evidence, since it was so
obvious that the action should never prevail over the privilege.""  345 U.S., at
11, n. 26, 97 L. Ed. 727, 73 S. Ct. 528 (emphasis added).

In a later case, we again credited the more sweeping holding in Totten, thus
confirming its continued validity.  See Weinberger v. Catholic Action of Hawaii/
Peace Educ. Project, 454 U.S. 139, 146-147, 70 L. Ed. 2d 298, 102 S. Ct. 197
(1981) (citing Totten in holding that ""whether or not the Navy has complied with
[§ 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 83 Stat 853, 42
U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C)[42 USCS § 4332(2)(C)]] 'to the fullest extent possible' is
beyond judicial scrutiny in this case,"" where, ""[d]ue to national security
reasons,"" the Navy could ""neither admit nor deny"" the fact that was central to
the suit, i.e., ""that it propose[d] to store nuclear weapons"" at a facility).
Reynolds therefore cannot plausibly be read to have replaced the categorical
[*10]  Totten bar with the balancing of the state secrets evidentiary privilege
in the distinct class of cases that depend upon clandestine spy relationships.

Nor does Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 100 L. Ed. 2d 632, 108 S. Ct. 2047 (1988)
, support respondents' claim.  There, we held that § 102(c) of the National
Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat 498, 50 U.S.C. § 403 (c)[50 USCS § 403(c)], may
not be read to exclude judicial review of the constitutional claims made by a
former CIA employee for alleged discrimination.  486 U.S., at 603, 100 L. Ed. 2d
632, 108 S. Ct. 2047.  In reaching that conclusion, we noted the ""'serious
constitutional question' that would arise if a federal statute were construed to
deny any judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim."" Ibid.  But there
is an obvious difference, for purposes of Totten, between a suit brought by an
acknowledged (though covert) employee of the CIA and one filed by an alleged
former spy. Only in the latter scenario is Totten's core concern implicated:
preventing the existence of the plaintiff's relationship with the Government
[***92]  from being revealed. 5 That is why the CIA regularly entertains Title
VII claims concerning the hiring and promotion of its employees, as we noted in
Webster, supra, at 604, 100 L. Ed. 2d 632, 108 S. Ct. 2047, yet Totten has long
barred suits such as respondents'.

5 The Court of Appeals apparently believed that the plaintiff's relationship
with the CIA was secret in Webster, just as in this case.  See 329 F.3d 1135,
1153 (CA9 2003).  It is true that the plaintiff in Webster proceeded under a
pseudonym because ""his status as a CIA employee cannot be publicly
acknowledged."" Brief for United States in Webster v Doe, O. T. 1987, No.
86-1294, p 3, n 1.  But the fact that the plaintiff in Webster kept his identity
secret did not mean that the employment relationship between him and the CIA was
not known and admitted by the CIA.

 There is, in short, no basis for respondents' and the Court of Appeals' view
that the Totten bar has been reduced to an example of the state secrets
privilege.  In a far closer case than this, we observed that  [HN2] if the
""precedent of this Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest
on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court  [*11]  of
Appeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court
the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.""  Rodriguez de Quijas v.
Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484, 104 L. Ed. 2d 526, 109 S.
Ct. 1917 (1989).

We adhere to Totten  [HN3] The state secrets privilege and the more frequent use
of in camera judicial proceedings simply cannot provide the absolute protection
we found necessary in enunciating the Totten rule.  The possibility that a suit
may proceed and [**1238]  an espionage relationship may be revealed, if the
state secrets privilege is found not to apply, is unacceptable: ""Even a small
chance that some court will order disclosure of a source's identity could well
impair intelligence gathering and cause sources to 'close up like a clam.'""  CIA
v. Sims, 471 U.S. 159, 175, 85 L. Ed. 2d 173, 105 S. Ct. 1881 (1985).  Forcing
the Government to litigate these claims would also make it vulnerable to
""graymail,"" i.e., individual lawsuits brought to induce the CIA to settle a case
(or prevent its filing) out of fear that any effort to litigate the action would
reveal classified information that may undermine ongoing covert operations.  And
requiring the Government to invoke the privilege on a case-by-case basis risks
the perception that it is either confirming or denying relationships with
individual plaintiffs.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.

CONCUR BY: Stevens

CONCUR

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurring.

In Totten v. United States, 92 U.S. 105, 23 L. Ed. 605 (1876), the Court held
that an alleged oral agreement between a deceased spy and President Lincoln was
unenforceable.  There may be situations in which the national interest would be
well served by a rule that permitted similar commitments made by less senior
officers to be enforced in court, subject to procedures designed to protect
sensitive information.  If that be so, Congress can modify the federal
common-law rule announced in Totten. For the purposes of today's decision,
[*12]  which I join, the doctrine of  [***93]  stare decisis provides a
sufficient justification for concluding that the complaint is without merit.
The Court wisely decides that the absence of an enforceable agreement requires
that respondents' constitutional and other claims be dismissed without first
answering an arguably antecedent jurisdictional question. See ante, at 6-7, n.
4,  161 L. Ed. 2d, at 89; see also Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment,
523 U.S. 83, 117-123, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210, 118 S. Ct. 1003 (1998) (Stevens, J.,
concurring in judgment).

Justice Scalia, concurring.

I join the Court's opinion because I do not agree with Justice Stevens's
concurrence, painting today's action as a vindication of his opinion concurring
in the judgment in Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83,
112, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210, 118 S. Ct. 1003 (1998), in which he would have held that
a jurisdictional bar does not prevent the resolution of a merits issue.  When
today's opinion refers to the issue in Totten v. United States, 92 U.S. 105, 23
L. Ed. 605 (1876), as ""the sort of 'threshold question' we have recognized may
be resolved before addressing jurisdiction,"" ante, at 7, n. 4,  161 L. Ed. 2d,
at 89, it is surely not referring to the run-of-the-mill, nonthreshold merits
question whether a cause of action exists.  And when it describes ""the unique
and categorical nature of the Totten bar--a rule designed not merely to defeat
the asserted claims, but to preclude judicial inquiry,"" ibid., it is assuredly
not describing the mere everyday absence of a cause of action. As applied today,
the bar of Totten is a jurisdictional one.

Of course even if it were not, given the squarely applicable precedent of
Totten, the absence of a cause of action is so clear that respondents' claims
are frivolous--establishing another jurisdictional ground for dismissal that the
Steel Co. majority opinion acknowledges.  See 523 U.S., at 89, 140 L. Ed. 2d
210, 118 S. Ct. 1003.

 [*164]  [**2413]   Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A] The Supreme Court of California and the United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit have provided conflicting answers to the following
question: ""Whether to establish a prima facie case under  Batson v. Kentucky,
476 U.S. 79, [90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712] (1986), the objector must show
that it is more likely than not that the other party's peremptory challenges, if
unexplained, were based on impermissible group bias?"" Pet. for Cert. i.  Because
both of those courts regularly review the validity of convictions obtained in
California criminal trials, respondent, the State of California, agreed to
petitioner's request that we grant certiorari and resolve the conflict.  We
agree with the Ninth Circuit that the question presented [**2414]  must be
answered in the negative, and accordingly reverse the judgment of the California
Supreme Court.

Petitioner Jay Shawn Johnson, a black male, was convicted in a California trial
court of second-degree murder and assault on a white 19-month-old child,
resulting in death.  During jury selection, a number of prospective jurors were
removed for cause until 43 eligible jurors remained, 3 of whom were black.  The
prosecutor used 3 of his 12 peremptory challenges to remove the black
prospective jurors. The resulting jury, including alternates, was all white.

[*165]  After the prosecutor exercised the second of his three peremptory
challenges against the prospective black  [***136]  jurors, defense counsel
objected on the ground that the challenge was unconstitutionally based on race
under both the California and United States Constitutions.   People v. Johnson,
30 Cal. 4th 1302, 1307, 1 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1, 71 P. 3d 270, 272-273 (2003). 1
Defense counsel alleged that the prosecutor ""had no apparent reason to challenge
this prospective juror 'other than [her] racial identity.'"" Ibid. (alteration in
original).  The trial judge did not ask the prosecutor to explain the rationale
for his strikes.  Instead, the judge simply found that petitioner had failed to
establish a prima facie case under the governing state precedent,  People v.
Wheeler, 22 Cal.3d 258, 148 Cal. Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748 (1978), reasoning
""'that there's not been shown a strong likelihood that the exercise of the
peremptory challenges were based upon a group rather than an individual basis,'""
30 Cal. 4th, at 1307, 71 P. 3d, at 272 (emphasis added).  The judge did,
however, warn the prosecutor that ""'we are very close.'""  People v. Johnson, 88
Cal. App. 4th 318, 105 Cal.Rptr.2d 727, 729 (2001).

Defense counsel made an additional motion the next day when the prosecutor
struck the final remaining prospective black juror.  30 Cal. 4th, at 1307, 71 P.
3d, at 272.  Counsel argued that the prosecutor's decision to challenge all of
the prospective black jurors constituted a ""systematic attempt to exclude
African-Americans from the jury panel.""  105 Cal.Rptr. 2d, at 729.  The trial
judge still did not seek an explanation from the prosecutor. Instead, she
explained that her own examination of the record had convinced her that the
prosecutor's strikes could be justified by race-neutral reasons.  Specifically,
the judge opined that the black venire members had offered equivocal or confused
answers in their written questionnaires.   30 Cal. 4th, at 1307-1308, 71 P. 3d,
at 272-273.  Despite the fact that ""'the Court would not grant the challenges
for cause, there were answers  [*166]  . . . at least on the questionnaires
themselves [such] that the Court felt that there was sufficient basis'"" for the
strikes.   Id., at 1308, 71 P. 3d, at 273 (brackets added).  Therefore, even
considering that all of the prospective black jurors had been stricken from the
pool, the judge determined that petitioner had failed to establish a prima facie
case.

The California Court of Appeal set aside the conviction.   People v. Johnson, 88
Cal. App. 4th 318, 105 Cal.Rptr.2d 727 (2001).  Over the dissent of one judge,
the majority ruled that the trial judge had erred by requiring petitioner to
establish a ""strong likelihood"" that the peremptory strikes had been
impermissibly [**2415]  based on race.  Instead, the trial judge should have
only required petitioner to proffer enough evidence to support an ""inference"" of
discrimination. 2 The Court of Appeal's holding relied on decisions of this
Court, prior California case law, and the decision of the United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in  Wade v. Terhune, 202 F.3d 1190 (2000).
Applying the proper ""reasonable inference""  [***137]  standard, the majority
concluded that petitioner had produced sufficient evidence to support a prima
facie case.

2 In reaching this holding, the Court of Appeal rejected the notion that a
showing of a ""'strong likelihood'"" is equivalent to a ""'reasonable inference.'""
To conclude so would ""be as novel a proposition as the idea that 'clear and
convincing evidence' has always meant a 'preponderance of the evidence.'""  105

 Respondent appealed, and the California Supreme Court reinstated petitioner's
conviction over the dissent of two justices.  The court stressed that  Batson v.
Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712 (1986), left to state
courts the task of establishing the standards used to evaluate the sufficiency
of defendants' prima facie cases.   30 Cal. 4th, at 1314, 71 P. 3d, at 277.  The
court then reviewed Batson, Wheeler, and those decisions' progeny, and concluded
that ""Wheeler's terms 'strong likelihood' and 'reasonable inference' state the
same standard""--one that is entirely consistent with Batson. 30 Cal. 4th, at
1313, 71 P. 3d, at 277.  A prima facie case under Batson establishes  [*167]  a
""'legally mandatory, rebuttable presumption,'"" it does not merely constitute
""enough evidence to permit the inference"" that discrimination has occurred.   30
Cal. 4th, at 1315, 71 P. 3d, at 278.  Batson, the court held, ""permits a court
to require the objector to present, not merely 'some evidence' permitting the
inference, but 'strong evidence' that makes discriminatory intent more likely
than not if the challenges are not explained.""  30 Cal. 4th, at 1316, 71 P. 3d,
at 278 .  The court opined that while this burden is ""not onerous,"" it remains
""substantial.""  Ibid., 71 P. 3d, at 279.

Applying that standard, the court acknowledged that the case involved the
""highly relevant"" circumstance that a black defendant was ""charged with killing
'his White girlfriend's child,'"" and that ""it certainly looks suspicious that
all three African-American prospective jurors were removed from the jury.""  Id.,
at 1326, 71 P. 3d, at 286.  Yet petitioner's Batson showing, the court held,
consisted ""primarily of the statistical disparity of peremptory challenges
between African-Americans and others.""  30 Cal. 4th, at 1327, 71 P. 3d, at 287.
Although those statistics were indeed ""troubling and, as the trial court stated,
the question was close,""  id., at 1328, 71 P. 3d, at 287, the court decided to
defer to the trial judge's ""carefully considered ruling."" Ibid. 3 We granted
certiorari, but dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction because the judgment
[**2416]  was not yet final.   Johnson v. California, 541 U.S. 428, 158 L. Ed.
2d 696, 124 S. Ct. 1833 (2004) (per curiam). After the California Court  [*168]
of Appeal decided the remaining issues, we again granted certiorari.   543 U.S.

3 In dissent, Justice Kennard argued that ""[r]equiring a defendant to persuade
the trial court of the prosecutor's discriminatory purpose at the first
Wheeler-Batson stage short-circuits the process, and provides inadequate
protection for the defendant's right to a fair trial . . . .""  30 Cal. 4th, at
1333, 71 P. 3d, at 291.  The proper standard for measuring a prima facie case
under Batson is whether the defendant has identified actions by the prosecutor
that, ""if unexplained, permit a reasonable inference of an improper purpose or
motive.""  30 Cal. 4th, at 1339, 71 P. 3d, at 294.  Trial judges, Justice Kennard
argued, should not speculate when it is not ""apparent that the [neutral]
explanation was the true reason for the challenge.""  Id., at 1340, 71 P. 3d, at
295.

II

[***LEdHR2A] [2A] The issue in this case is narrow but important.  It concerns
the scope of the first of three steps this Court enumerated in Batson , which
together guide trial courts' constitutional  [***138]  review of peremptory
strikes.  Those three Batson steps should by now be familiar.   [HN1] First, the
defendant must make out a prima facie case ""by showing that the totality of the
relevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.""  476 U.S.,
at 93-94, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712 (citing  Washington v. Davis, 426
U.S. 229, 239-242, 48 L. Ed. 2d 597, 96 S. Ct. 2040 (1976)). 4 Second, once the
defendant has made out a prima facie case, the ""burden shifts to the State to
explain adequately the racial exclusion"" by offering permissible race-neutral
justifications for the strikes.   476 U.S., at 94, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct.
1712; see also  Alexander v. Louisiana, 405 U.S. 625, 632, 31 L. Ed. 2d 536, 92
S. Ct. 1221 (1972).  Third, ""[i]f a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the
trial court must then decide . . . whether the opponent of the strike has proved
purposeful racial discrimination.""  Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765, 767, 131 L.
Ed. 2d 834, 115 S. Ct. 1769 (1995) (per curiam).

  [***LEdHR1A] [1B] The question before us is whether Batson permits California
to require at step one that ""the objector must show that it is more likely than
not the other party's peremptory challenges, if unexplained, were based on
impermissible group bias.""  30 Cal. 4th, at 1318, 71 P. 3d, at 280.  Although we
recognize that States do have flexibility in formulating appropriate procedures
to comply with Batson, we conclude that California's ""more likely than not""
standard is an inappropriate yardstick by which to measure the sufficiency of a
prima facie case.

[*169]  We begin with Batson itself, which on its own terms provides no support
for California's rule.  There, we held that  [HN2] a prima facie case of
discrimination can be made out by offering a wide variety of evidence, 5 so long
as the sum of the proffered facts gives ""rise to an inference of discriminatory
purpose.""  476 U.S., at 94, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712.  We explained
that:




     ""[A] defendant may establish a prima facie case of purposeful
     discrimination in selection of the petit jury solely on evidence
     concerning the prosecutor's exercise of peremptory challenges at the
     defendant's trial.  To establish such a case, the defendant first must
     show that he is a member of a cognizable racial group, and that the
     prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the
     venire members of the defendant's race.  Second, the defendant is
     entitled  [**2417] to rely on the fact, as to which there can be no
     dispute, that peremptory challenges constitute a jury selection
     practice that permits 'those to discriminate who are of a mind to
     discriminate.' Finally, the defendant  [***139]  must show that these
     facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the
     prosecutor used that practice to exclude the veniremen from the petit
     jury on account of their race.""  Id., at 96, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S.
     Ct. 1712 (quoting  Avery v. Georgia, 345 U.S. 559, 562, 97 L. Ed.
     1244, 73 S. Ct. 891 (1953); citations omitted).

5 In Batson, we spoke of the methods by which prima facie cases could be proved
in permissive terms.  A defendant may satisfy his prima facie burden, we said,
""by relying solely on the facts concerning [the selection of the venire] in his
case.""  476 U.S., at 95, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712 (emphasis in
original).  We declined to require proof of a pattern or practice because ""'[a]
single invidiously discriminatory governmental act' is not 'immunized by the
absence of such discrimination in the making of other comparable decisions.'""
Ibid. (quoting  Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429
U.S. 252, 266, n. 14, 50 L. Ed. 2d 450, 97 S. Ct. 555 (1977)).
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Indeed, Batson  held that because the petitioner had timely objected to the
prosecutor's decision to strike ""all black persons on the venire,"" the trial
court was in error when it  [*170]  ""flatly rejected the objection without
requiring the prosecutor to give an explanation for his action.""  476 U.S., at
100, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712.  We did not hold that the petitioner had
proved discrimination.  Rather, we remanded the case for further proceedings
because the trial court failed to demand an explanation from the prosecutor--
i.e., to proceed to Batson's second step--despite the fact that the petitioner's
evidence supported an inference of discrimination.  Ibid.

Thus, in describing the burden-shifting framework, we assumed in Batson that the
trial judge would have the benefit of all relevant circumstances, including the
prosecutor's explanation, before deciding whether it was more likely than not
that the challenge was improperly motivated.  We did not intend the first step
to be so onerous that a defendant would have to persuade the judge--on the basis
of all the facts, some of which are impossible for the defendant to know with
certainty--that the challenge was more likely than not the product of purposeful
discrimination. Instead,  [HN3] a defendant satisfies the requirements of Batson
's first step by producing evidence sufficient to permit the trial judge to draw
an inference that discrimination has occurred.

Respondent, however, focuses on Batson's ultimate sentence: ""If the trial court
decides that the facts establish, prima facie, purposeful discrimination and the
prosecutor does not come forward with a neutral explanation for his action, our
precedents require that petitioner's conviction be reversed."" Ibid. For this to
be true, respondent contends, a Batson claim must prove the ultimate facts by a
preponderance of the evidence in the prima facie case; otherwise, the argument
goes, a prosecutor's failure to respond to a prima facie case would inexplicably
entitle a defendant to judgment as a matter of law on the basis of nothing more
than an inference that discrimination may have occurred.  Brief for Respondent
13-18.

[***LEdHR2A] [2B]  [***LEdHR3A] [3A] Respondent's argument is misguided.   [HN4]
Batson, of course, explicitly stated that the defendant ultimately carries the
[*171]  ""burden of persuasion"" to ""'prove the existence of purposeful
discrimination.'""  476 U.S., at 93, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712 (quoting
Whitus v. Georgia, 385 U.S. 545, 550, 17 L. Ed. 2d 599, 87 S. Ct. 643 (1967)).
This burden of persuasion ""rests with, and never shifts from, the opponent of
the strike.""  Purkett, 514 U.S., at 768, 131 L. Ed. 2d 834, 115 S. Ct. 1769.
Thus, even if the State produces only a frivolous or utterly nonsensical
justification for its strike, the case does not end--it merely proceeds to step
[***140]  three.  Ibid. 6 The first two Batson steps govern the  [**2418]
production of evidence that allows the trial court to determine the
persuasiveness of the defendant's constitutional claim.  ""It is not until the
third step that the persuasiveness of the justification becomes relevant--the
step in which the trial court determines whether the opponent of the strike has
carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination.""  Purkett, supra, at
768, 131 L. Ed. 2d 834, 115 S. Ct. 1769. 7

6  [***LEdHR3A] [3B] In the unlikely hypothetical in which the prosecutor
declines to respond to a trial judge's inquiry regarding his justification for
making a strike, the evidence before the judge would consist not only of the
original facts from which the prima facie case was established, but also the
prosecutor's refusal to justify his strike in light of the court's request.
Such a refusal would provide additional support for the inference of
discrimination raised by a defendant's prima facie case. Cf.  United States ex
rel. Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immigration, 273 U.S. 103, 111, 71 L. Ed. 560,
47 S. Ct. 302 (1927).

7 This explanation comports with our interpretation of the burden-shifting
framework in cases arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
See, e.g.,  Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 577, 57 L. Ed. 2d 957,

Batson's purposes further support our conclusion.  The constitutional interests
Batson sought to vindicate are not  [*172]  limited to the rights possessed by
the defendant on trial, see  476 U.S., at 87, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712,
nor to those citizens who desire to participate ""in the administration of the
law, as jurors,""  Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303, 308, 25 L. Ed. 664
(1880).  Undoubtedly, the overriding interest in eradicating discrimination from
our civic institutions suffers whenever an individual is excluded from making a
significant contribution to governance on account of his race.  Yet the ""harm
from discriminatory jury selection extends beyond that inflicted on the
defendant and the excluded juror to touch the entire community.  Selection
procedures that purposefully exclude black persons from juries undermine public
confidence in the fairness of our system of justice.""  Batson, 476 U.S., at 87,
90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712; see also  Smith v. Texas, 311 U.S. 128, 130,
85 L. Ed. 84, 61 S. Ct. 164 (1940) (""For racial discrimination to result in the
exclusion from jury service of otherwise qualified groups not only violates our
Constitution and the laws enacted under it but it is at war with our basic
concepts of a democratic society and a representative government"" (footnote
omitted)).

[HN5]  [***LEdHR1A] [1C] The Batson framework is designed to produce actual
answers to suspicions and inferences that discrimination may have infected the
jury selection process. See  476 U.S., at 97-98, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct.
1712.  The inherent uncertainty present in inquiries of discriminatory purpose
counsels against engaging in needless and imperfect  [***141]  speculation when
a direct answer can be obtained by asking a simple question.  See  Paulino v.
Castro, 371 F.3d 1083, 1090 (CA9 2004) (""[I]t does not matter that the
prosecutor might have had good reasons . . . [w]hat matters is the real reason
they were stricken"" (emphasis deleted));  Holloway v. Horn, 355 F.3d 707, 725
(CA3 2004) (speculation ""does not aid our inquiry into the reasons the
prosecutor actually harbored"" for a peremptory strike).  The three-step process
thus simultaneously serves the public purposes Batson is designed to vindicate
and encourages ""prompt rulings on objections to peremptory challenges without
substantial disruption of the  [*173]  jury selection process.""  [**2419]
Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 358-359, 114 L. Ed. 2d 395, 111 S. Ct. 1859
(1991) (opinion of Kennedy, J.).

[***LEdHR1A] [1D]  [***LEdHR4] [4] The disagreements among the state-court
judges who reviewed the record in this case illustrate the imprecision of
relying on judicial speculation to resolve plausible claims of discrimination.
In this case the inference of discrimination was sufficient to invoke a comment
by the trial judge ""that 'we are very close,'"" and on review, the California
Supreme Court acknowledged that ""it certainly looks suspicious that all three
African-American prospective jurors were removed from the jury.""  30 Cal. 4th,
at 1307, 1326, 71 P. 3d, at 273, 286.  Those inferences that discrimination may
have occurred were sufficient to establish a prima facie case under Batson

[***LEdHR1A] [1E] The facts of this case well illustrate that  [HN6]
California's ""more likely than not"" standard is at odds with the prima facie
inquiry mandated by Batson. The judgment of the California Supreme Court is
therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered

Justice Thomas, dissenting.

The Court says that States ""have flexibility in formulating appropriate
procedures to comply with  Batson [v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69,
106 S. Ct. 1712 (1986)],"" ante, at ____, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 138, but it then
tells California how to comply with ""the prima facie inquiry mandated by Batson
,"" ante, at ____, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 141.  In Batson itself, this Court
disclaimed any intent to instruct state courts on how to implement its holding.
476 U.S., at 99, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712 (""We decline, however, to
formulate particular procedures to be followed upon a defendant's  [*174]
timely objection to a prosecutor's challenges"");  id., at 99-100, n. 24, 90 L.
Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712.  According to Batson, the Equal Protection Clause
requires that prosecutors select juries based on factors other than race--not
that litigants bear particular burdens of proof or persuasion.  Because Batson's
burden-shifting approach is ""a prophylactic framework"" that polices racially
discriminatory jury selection  [***142]  rather than ""an independent
constitutional command,""  Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U.S. 551, 555, 95 L. Ed.
2d 539, 107 S. Ct. 1990 (1987), States have ""wide discretion, subject to the
minimum requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, to experiment with solutions
to difficult problems of policy,""  Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259, 273, 145 L.
Ed. 2d 756, 120 S. Ct. 746 (2000);  Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428,
438-439, 147 L. Ed. 2d 405, 120 S. Ct. 2326 (2000).  California's procedure
falls comfortably within its broad discretion to craft its own rules of criminal
procedure, and I therefore respectfully dissent.

 [*115]  [**1455]   Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A]  We decide in this case whether an individual may enforce the
limitations on local zoning authority set forth in § 332(c)(7) of the
Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7) [47 U.S.C.S. § 332(c)(7)],
through an action under Rev Stat § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 [42 U.S.C.S. § 1983].

I

Congress enacted the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (TCA), 110 Stat. 56, to
promote competition and higher quality in American telecommunications services
and to ""encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies.""
Ibid. One of the means by which it sought to accomplish these goals was
reduction of the impediments imposed by local governments upon the installation
of facilities for wireless communications, such as antenna towers. To this end,
[HN1] the TCA amended the Communications Act of 1934, 48 Stat 1064, to include §
332(c)(7), which imposes specific  [***323]  limitations on the traditional
authority of state and local governments to regulate the location, construction,
and modification of such facilities, 110 Stat. 151, codified at 47 U.S.C. §
332(c)(7) [47 U.S.C.S. § 332(c)(7)].  [*116]  Under this provision, local
governments may not ""unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally
equivalent services,"" § 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(I), take actions that ""prohibit or have
the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services,"" §
332(c)(7)(B)(i)(II), or limit the placement of wireless facilities ""on the basis
of the environmental effects of radio [**1456]  frequency emissions,"" §
332(c)(7)(B)(iv).  They must act on requests for authorization to locate
wireless facilities ""within a reasonable period of time,"" § 332(c)(7)(B)(ii),
and each decision denying such a request must ""be in writing and supported by
substantial evidence contained in a written record,"" § 332(c)(7)(B)(iii).
Lastly, § 332(c)(7)(B)(v), which is central to the present case, provides as
follows:


      [HN2] ""Any person adversely affected by any final action or failure
     to act by a State or local government or any instrumentality thereof
     that is inconsistent with this subparagraph may, within 30 days after
     such action or failure to act, commence an action in any court of
     competent jurisdiction.""



Respondent Mark Abrams owns a home in a low-density, residential neighborhood in
the city of Rancho Palos Verdes, California (City).  His property is located at
a high elevation, near the peak of the Rancho Palos Verdes Peninsula.   Rancho
Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 101 Cal. App. 4th 367, 371, 124 Cal.Rptr.2d 80, 82
(2002). The record reflects that the location is both scenic and, because of its
high elevation, ideal for radio transmissions.   Id., at 371-372, 124 Cal.Rptr.
2d, at 82-83.

In 1989, respondent obtained a permit from the City to construct a 52.5-foot
antenna on his property for amateur use. 1 He installed the antenna shortly
thereafter, and in the  [*117]  years that followed placed several smaller,
tripod antennas on the property without prior permission from the City.  He used
the antennas both for noncommercial purposes (to provide an amateur radio
service and to relay signals from other amateur radio operators) and for
commercial purposes (to provide customers two-way radio communications from
portable and mobile transceivers, and to repeat the signals of customers so as
to enable greater range of transmission).  Ibid.

1 The City's approval specified a maximum height of 40 feet, but, because of an
administrative error, the permit itself authorized respondent to construct a
tower 12.5 feet taller.   354 F.3d 1094, 1095 (CA9 2004).

 In 1998, respondent sought permission to construct a second antenna tower. In
the course of investigating that application, the City learned that respondent
was using his antennas to provide a commercial service, in violation of a City
ordinance requiring a ""conditional-use permit"" from the City Planning Commission
(Commission) for commercial antenna use.  See Commission Resolution No. 2000-12
(""A Resolution of the Planning Commission of the City of Rancho Palos Verdes
Denying With Prejudice Conditional Use Permit No. 207 for the Proposed
Commercial Use of Existing Antennae on an Existing Antenna Support Structure,
Located at 44 Oceanaire Drive  [***324]  in the Del Cerro Neighborhood""), App.
to Pet. for Cert. 54a.  On suit by the City, Los Angeles County Superior Court
enjoined respondent from using the antennas for a commercial purpose.   Rancho
Palos Verdes, supra, 101 Cal. App. 4th, at 373, 124 Cal.Rptr. 2d, at 84; App. to
Pet. for Cert. 35a.

Two weeks later, in July 1999, respondent applied to the Commission for the
requisite conditional-use permit.  The application drew strong opposition from
several of respondent's neighbors.  The Commission conducted two hearings and
accepted written evidence, after which it denied the application.  Id., at
54a-63a.  The Commission explained that granting respondent permission to
operate commercially ""would perpetuate . . . adverse visual impacts"" from
respondent's existing antennas and establish precedent for similar projects in
residential areas in the future.  [**1457]  Id., at 57a.  The  [*118]
Commission also concluded that denial of respondent's application was consistent
with 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7) [47 U.S.C.S. § 332(c)(7)], making specific findings
that its action complied with each of that provision's requirements.  App. to
Pet. for Cert. 61a-62a.  The city council denied respondent's appeal.  Id., at
52a.  See generally No. CV00-09071-SVW (RNBx) (CD Cal., Jan. 9, 2002), App. to
Pet. for Cert. 22a-23a.

On August 24, 2000, respondent filed this action against the City in the
District Court for the Central District of California, alleging, as relevant,
that denial of the use permit violated the limitations placed on the City's
zoning authority by § 332(c)(7).  In particular, respondent charged that the
City's action discriminated against the mobile relay services he sought to
provide, § 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(I), effectively prohibited the provision of mobile
relay services, § 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(II), and was not supported by substantial
evidence in the record, § 332(c)(7)(B)(iii).  App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a.
Respondent sought injunctive relief under § 332(c)(7)(B)(v), and money damages
and attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988.  Plaintiff/Petitioner's
Brief Re: Remedies and Damages, Case No. 00-09071-SVW (RNBx) (CD Cal., Feb. 25,
2002), App. to Reply Brief for Petitioners 2a-7a.

Notwithstanding § 332(c)(7)(B)(v)'s direction that courts ""hear and decide""
actions ""on an expedited basis,"" the District Court did not act on respondent's
complaint until January 9, 2002, 16 months after filing; it concluded that the
City's denial of a conditional-use permit was not supported by substantial
evidence. App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a-26a.  The court explained that the City
could not rest its denial on esthetic concerns, since the antennas in question
were already in existence and would remain in place whatever the disposition of
the permit application.  Id., at 23a-24a.  Nor, the court said, could the City
reasonably base its decision on the fear of setting precedent for the location
of commercial antennas in residential areas, since adverse impacts from  [*119]
new structures would always be a basis for permit denial.  Id., at 25a.  In
light of the paucity of support for the City's action, the court concluded that
denial of the permit was ""an act of spite by the community."" Id., at 24a.  In an
order issued two months later, the District Court held that § 332(c)(7)(B)(v)
provided the exclusive remedy for the City's actions.  Judgment of Injunction,
No. CV00-09071-SVW (RNBx) (CD Cal., Mar. 18, 2002), App. to Pet.  [***325]  for
Cert. 14a.  Accordingly, it ordered the City to grant respondent's application
for a conditional-use permit, but refused respondent's request for damages under
§ 1983.  Respondent appealed.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed on the latter point, and
remanded for determination of money damages and attorney's fees.   354 F.3d
1094, 1101 (2004).  We granted certiorari.   542 U.S. 965, 542 U.S. 965, 159 L.
Ed. 2d 856, 125 S. Ct. 26 (2004).

A

[***LEdHR2A]  Title 42 U.S.C. § 1983 [42 U.S.C.S. § 1983] provides:


      [HN3] ""Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance,
     regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory . . .
     subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States
     or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of
     any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and
     laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit
     in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.""



 [**1458]  In  Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 65 L. Ed. 2d 555, 100 S. Ct. 2502
(1980), we held that  [HN4] this section ""means what it says"" and authorizes
suits to enforce individual rights under federal statutes as well as the
Constitution.   Id., at 4, 65 L. Ed. 2d 555, 100 S. Ct. 2502.

Our subsequent cases have made clear, however, that § 1983 does not provide an
avenue for relief every time a state actor violates a federal law.  As a
threshold matter, the text of § 1983 permits the enforcement of ""rights, not the
[*120]  broader or vaguer 'benefits' or 'interests.'""  Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536
U.S. 273, 283, 153 L. Ed. 2d 309, 122 S. Ct. 2268 (2002) (emphasis in original).
Accordingly, to sustain a § 1983 action, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the
federal statute creates an individually enforceable right in the class of
beneficiaries to which he belongs.  See  id., at 285, 153 L. Ed. 2d 309, 122 S.
Ct. 2268.

[***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR3A]   [***LEdHR4A]    [HN5] Even after this showing,
""there is only a rebuttable presumption that the right is enforceable under §
1983.""   Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 341, 137 L. Ed. 2d 569, 117 S. Ct.
1353 (1997).  The defendant may defeat this presumption by demonstrating that
Congress did not intend that remedy for a newly created right.  See ibid.;
Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992, 1012, 82 L. Ed. 2d 746, 104 S. Ct. 3457 (1984).
Our cases have explained that evidence of such congressional intent may be found
directly in the statute creating the right, or inferred from the statute's
creation of a ""comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with
individual enforcement under § 1983.""  Blessing, supra, at 341, 137 L. Ed. 569,
117 S. Ct. 1353. 2 See also  Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea
Clammers Ass'n, 453 U.S. 1, 19-20, 69 L. Ed. 2d 435, 101 S. Ct. 2615 (1981).

[***LEdHR3A]  This does not contravene the canon against implied repeal, see
Posadas v. National City Bank, 296 U.S. 497, 503, 80 L. Ed. 351, 56 S. Ct. 349
(1936), because we have held that canon inapplicable to a statute that creates
no rights but merely provides a civil cause of action to remedy ""some otherwise
defined federal right,""  Great Am. Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Novotny, 442 U.S.
366, 376, 60 L. Ed. 2d 957, 99 S. Ct. 2345 (1979) (dealing with a provision
related to § 1983, 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)[42 USCS § 1985(3)]).  In such a case, ""we
are not faced . . . with a question of implied repeal,"" but with whether the
rights created by a later statute ""may be asserted within the remedial
framework"" of the earlier one.   Great American Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n, supra,

 B

[***LEdHR1A]  The City conceded below, and neither the City nor the Government
as amicus disputes here, that § 332(c)(7) creates individually enforceable
rights; we assume, arguendo, that this is so.  The critical question, then, is
whether Congress  [*121]  meant the judicial remedy expressly authorized by §
332(c)(7) to coexist with an alternative remedy available in a § 1983 action.
We conclude not.

[***LEdHR4A]   [HN6] The provision of an express, private means of redress in
the statute itself is ordinarily an indication that Congress did not intend to
leave open a more expansive remedy under § 1983.  As we have said in a different
setting, ""[t]he express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive rule
suggests that Congress intended to preclude others.""  Alexander v. Sandoval, 532
U.S. 275, 290, 149 L. Ed. 2d 517, 121 S. Ct. 1511 (2001).  Thus, the existence
of a more restrictive private remedy for statutory violations has been the
dividing line between those cases in which we have held that an action would lie
under § 1983 and those in which we have held that it would not.

[**1459]  We have found § 1983 unavailable to remedy violations of federal
statutory rights in two cases: Sea Clammers and Smith. Both of those decisions
rested upon the existence of more restrictive remedies provided in the violated
statute itself.  See  Smith, supra, at 1011-1012, 82 L. Ed. 2d 746, 104 S. Ct.
3457 (recognizing a § 1983 action ""would . . . render superfluous most of the
detailed procedural protections outlined in the statute"");  Sea Clammers, supra,
at 20, 69 L. Ed. 2d 435, 101 S. Ct. 2615  [HN7] (""[W]hen a state official is
alleged to have violated a federal statute which provides its own comprehensive
enforcement scheme, the requirements of that enforcement procedure may not be
bypassed by bringing suit directly under § 1983"" (internal quotation marks
omitted)).  Moreover,  [HN8] in all of the cases in which we have held that §
1983 is available for violation of a federal statute, we have emphasized that
the statute at issue, in contrast to those in Sea Clammers and Smith, did not
provide a private judicial remedy (or, in most of the cases, even a private
administrative remedy) for the rights violated.  See  Blessing, supra, at 348,
137 L. Ed. 569, 117 S. Ct. 1353 (""Unlike the federal programs at issue in [Sea
Clammers and Smith], Title IV-D contains no private remedy--either judicial or
administrative--through which aggrieved persons can seek redress"");  Livadas v.
Bradshaw, 512 U.S. 107, 133-134, 129 L. Ed. 2d 93,  [*122]  114 S. Ct. 2068
(1994) (there was a ""complete absence of provision for relief from governmental
interference"" in the statute);  Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493

comprehensive enforcement scheme for preventing state interference with
federally protected labor rights that would foreclose the § 1983 remedy"");

Smith . . ., the statutes at issue themselves provided for private judicial
remedies, thereby evidencing congressional intent to supplant the § 1983 remedy.
There is nothing of that kind found in the . . . Housing Act"").

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR4A]  The Government as amicus, joined by the City, urges
us to hold that the availability of a private judicial remedy is not merely
indicative of, but conclusively establishes, a congressional intent to preclude
§ 1983 relief.  Brief for United States 17; Brief for Petitioners 35.  We
decline to do so.   [HN9] The ordinary inference that the remedy provided in the
statute is exclusive can surely be overcome by textual indication, express or
implicit, that the remedy is to complement, rather than supplant, § 1983.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR5A]   [***LEdHR6A]   [***LEdHR7A]   [***LEdHR8] [8]
[HN10] There is, however, no such indication in the TCA, which adds no remedies
to those available under § 1983, and limits relief in ways that § 1983 does not.
Judicial review of zoning decisions under § 332(c)(7)(B)(v) must be sought
within 30 days after the governmental entity has taken ""final action,"" and, once
the action is filed, the court must ""hear and decide"" it ""on an expedited
basis."" § 332(c)(7)(B)(v).  The remedies available, moreover, perhaps do not
include compensatory damages (the lower courts are seemingly in disagreement on
[*123]  this point 3), and certainly do [**1460]  not include attorney's fees
and costs. 4 A § 1983 action, by contrast, can be brought much later than 30
days after the final action, 5 and need not be heard and decided on an expedited
basis.  And the successful plaintiff may recover not only damages but reasonable
attorney's fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 [42 U.S.C.S. § 1988].
Thiboutot, 448 U.S., at 9, 65 L. Ed. 2d 555, 100 S. Ct. 2502.  Liability for
attorney's fees would have a particularly  [***328]  severe impact in the §
332(c)(7) context, making local governments liable for the (often substantial)
legal expenses of large commercial interests for the misapplication of a complex
and novel statutory scheme. See  Nextel Partners Inc. v. Kingston Township, 286

in a number of provisions, but not in § 332(c)(7)(B)(v).  See, e.g., 47 USC §§
206, 325(e)(10), 551(f)(2)(C), 605(e)(3)(B)(iii) [47 U.S.C.S. §§ 206, 325(e)(10)

5  [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR6A]  The statute of limitations for a § 1983 claim is
generally the applicable state-law period for personal-injury torts.   Wilson v.
Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 275, 276, 85 L. Ed. 2d 254, 105 S. Ct. 1938 (1985); see
also  Owens v. Okure, 488 U.S. 235, 240-241, 102 L. Ed. 2d 594, 109 S. Ct. 573
(1989).  On this basis, the applicable limitations period for respondent's §
1983 action would presumably be one year.  See  Silva v. Crain, 169 F.3d 608,
610 (CA9 1999) (citing Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. § 340.3 (West 1982)).  It may
be, however, that this limitations period does not apply to respondent's § 1983
claim.  In 1990, Congress enacted 28 U.S.C. § 1658(a) (2000 ed., Supp. II) [28
U.S.C.S. § 1658(a))], which provides a 4-year, catchall limitations period
applicable to ""civil action[s] arising under an Act of Congress enacted after""
December 1, 1990.  In  Jones v. R. R. Donnelley & Sons Co., 541 U.S. 369, 158 L.
Ed. 2d 645, 124 S. Ct. 1836 (2004), we held that this 4-year limitations period
applies to all claims ""made possible by a post-1990 [congressional] enactment.""
Id., at 382, 158 L. Ed. 2d 645, 124 S. Ct. 1836.  Since the claim here rests
upon violation of the post-1990 TCA, § 1658 would seem to apply.

  [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR4A]  Respondent's only response to the attorney's-fees
point is that it is a ""policy argumen[t],"" properly left to Congress.  Brief for
Respondent 35-36.  That response assumes, however, that Congress's refusal to
attach attorney's fees to the remedy that it created in the TCA does not itself
represent a congressional choice.  Sea Clammers and Smith adopt the opposite
assumption--that  [HN12] limitations upon the remedy contained in the statute
are deliberate and are not to be evaded through § 1983.  See  Smith, 468 U.S.,
at 1011-1012, and n 5, 82 L. Ed. 2d 746, 104 S. Ct. 3457   Sea Clammers, 453
U.S., at 14, 20, 69 L. Ed. 2d 435, 101 S. Ct. 2615.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR6A]  Respondent disputes that a § 1983 action to enforce
§ 332(c)(7)(B) would enjoy a longer statute of limitations than an action under
§ 332(c)(7)(B)(v).  He argues that the rule adopted in  Wilson v. Garcia, 471
U.S. 261, 85 L. Ed. 2d 254, 105 S. Ct. 1938 (1985), that § 1983 claims are
governed by the state-law statute of limitations for personal-injury torts, does
not apply to § 1983 actions to enforce statutes that themselves contain a
statute of limitations; in such cases, he argues, the limitations period in the
federal statute displaces the otherwise applicable state statute of limitations.
This contention cannot be reconciled with our decision in Wilson, which
expressly rejected the proposition that the limitations period for a § 1983
claim depends [**1461]  on the nature of the underlying right being asserted.
See  id., at 271-275, 85 L. Ed. 2d 254, 105 S. Ct. 1938.  We concluded instead
that  [HN13] 42 U.S.C. § 1988 [42 U.S.C.S. § 1988] is ""a directive to select, in
each State, the one most appropriate statute of limitations for all § 1983
claims.""  471 U.S., at 275, 85 L. Ed. 2d 254, 105 S. Ct. 1938 (emphasis added);
see also  Owens v. Okure, 488 U.S. 235, 240-241, 102 L. Ed. 2d 594, 109 S. Ct.
573 (1989) (""42 U.S.C. § 1988 [42 U.S.C.S. § 1988] requires courts to borrow and
apply to all § 1983 claims the one most analogous state statute of limitations""
(emphasis added)).  We acknowledged that ""a few § 1983 claims are based on
statutory  [*125]  rights,""  Wilson, supra, at 278, 85 L. Ed. 2d 254, 105 S. Ct.
1938, but carved out no exception for them.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR7A]  Respondent also argues that, if 28 U.S.C. § 1658
(2000 ed., Supp. II)[28 U.S.C.S. § 1658], rather than Wilson, applies to his §
1983 action, see n 5, supra, § 1658's 4-year statute of limitations is
inapplicable.  This is so, he claims, because § 332(c)(7)(B)(v)'s requirement
that actions be filed within 30 days falls within § 1658's prefatory clause,
""Except as otherwise provided by law."" 6 We think not.   [HN14] The language of
§ 332(c)(7)(B)(v) that imposes the limitations period (""within 30 days after
such action or failure to act"") is inextricably linked to--indeed, is  [***329]
embedded within--the language that creates the right of action (""may . . .
commence an action in any court of competent jurisdiction"").  It cannot possibly
be regarded as a statute of limitations generally applicable to any action to
enforce the rights created by § 332(c)(7)(B).  Cf.  Agency Holding Corp. v.
Malley-Duff & Associates, Inc., 483 U.S. 143, 168, 97 L. Ed. 2d 121, 107 S. Ct.
2759 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (""Federal statutes of
limitations . . . are almost invariably tied to specific causes of action"").
Respondent's argument thus reduces to a suggestion that we ""borrow"" §
332(c)(7)(B)(v)'s statute of limitations and attach it to § 1983 actions
asserting violations of § 332(c)(7)(B).  Section 1658's ""[e]xcept as otherwise
provided by law"" clause does not support this suggestion.

 C

[***LEdHR1A]  The Ninth Circuit based its conclusion that Congress intended to
permit plaintiffs to proceed under § 1983, in part, on the TCA's so-called
""saving clause,"" TCA § 601(c)(1), 110 Stat. 143, note following 47 U.S.C. § 152
[47 U.S.C.S. § 152].   354 F.3d, at 1099-1100.  That provision reads as follows:



      [*126]   [HN16] ""(1) NO IMPLIED EFFECT--This Act and the amendments
     made by this Act shall not be construed to modify, impair, or
     supersede Federal, State, or local law unless expressly so provided in
     such Act or amendments.""



The Court of Appeals took this to be an express statement of Congress's intent
not to preclude an action under § 1983, reasoning that to do so would be to
""'impair'"" the operation of that section.   Id., at 1100.

We do not think this an apt assessment of what ""impair[ment]"" consists of.
Construing § 332(c)(7), as we do, to create rights that may be enforced only
through the statute's express remedy leaves the pre-TCA operation of § 1983
entirely unaffected.  Indeed, the crux of our holding is that  [HN17] §
332(c)(7) has no effect on § 1983 whatsoever: The rights § 332(c)(7) created may
not be enforced under § 1983 and, conversely, the claims available under § 1983
prior to the enactment of the TCA [**1462]  continue to be available after its
enactment.  The saving clause of the TCA does not require a court to go further
and permit enforcement under § 1983 of the TCA's substantive standards.  To
apply to the present case what we said with regard to a different statute: ""The
right [Abrams] claims under [§ 332(c)(7)] did not even arguably exist before the
passage of [the TCA].  The only question here, therefore, is whether the rights
created by [the TCA] may be asserted within the remedial framework of [§ 1983].""
Great Am. Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Novotny, 442 U.S. 366, 376-377, 60 L. Ed. 2d
957, 99 S. Ct. 2345 (1979).

This interpretation of the saving clause is consistent with Sea Clammers. Saving
clauses attached to the statutes at issue in that case provided that the
statutes should not be interpreted to ""'restrict any right which any person . .
. may have under any statute or common law to seek enforcement of any . . .
standard or limitation or to seek any  [***330]  other relief (including relief
against the Administrator or a State agency).' 33 U.S.C. § 1365(e) [33 U.S.C.S.
§ 1365(e)].""  453 U.S., at 7, n. 10, 69 L. Ed. 2d 435, 101 S. Ct. 2615; see
[*127]  also  id., at 7-8, n. 11, 69 L. Ed. 2d 435, 101 S. Ct. 2615.  We refused
to read those clauses to ""preserve"" a § 1983 action, holding that they did not
""refer . . . to a suit for redress of a violation of th[e] statutes [at issue] .
. . .""  Id., at 20-21, n. 31, 69 L. Ed. 2d 435, 101 S. Ct. 2615.

 [HN18] Enforcement of § 332(c)(7) through § 1983 would distort the scheme of
expedited judicial review and limited remedies created by § 332(c)(7)(B)(v).  We
therefore hold that the TCA--by providing a judicial remedy different from §
1983 in § 332(c)(7) itself--precluded resort to § 1983.  The judgment of the
Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice O'Connor, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg
join, concurring.

I agree with the Court.  It wisely rejects the Government's proposed rule that
the availability of a private judicial remedy ""conclusively establishes . . . a
congressional intent to preclude [Rev Stat § 1979, 42 U.S.C.] § 1983 [42
U.S.C.S. § 1983] relief.""  Ante, at 122, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 327 (emphasis added).
The statute books are too many, federal laws too diverse, and their purposes too
complex  for any legal formula to provide more than general guidance.  Cf.
Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 291, 153 L. Ed. 2d 309, 122 S. Ct. 2268
(2002) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment).  The Court today provides general
guidance in the form of an ""ordinary inference"" that when Congress creates a
specific judicial remedy, it does so to the exclusion of § 1983.   Ante, at 122,
161 L. Ed. 2d, at 327.  I would add that context, not just literal text, will
often lead a court to Congress' intent in respect to a particular statute.  Cf.
ibid. (referring to ""implicit"" textual indications).

Context here, for example, makes clear that Congress saw a national problem,
namely, an ""inconsistent and, at times,  [*128]  conflicting patchwork"" of state
and local siting requirements, which threatened ""the deployment"" of a national
wireless communication system.  H. R. Rep. No. 104-204, pt. 1, p. 94 (1995).
Congress initially considered a single national solution, namely, a Federal
Communications Commission wireless tower siting policy that would pre-empt state
and local authority.  Ibid.; see also H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-458, p 207
(1996).  But Congress ultimately rejected the national approach and substituted
[**1463]  a system based on cooperative federalism.  Id., at 207-208.  State and
local authorities would remain free to make siting decisions.  They would do so,
however, subject to minimum "

 [*624]  [**2009]  [***959]    JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the
Court.

We here consider whether shackling a convicted offender during the penalty phase
of a capital case violates the Federal Constitution. We hold that  [HN1] the
Constitution forbids the use of visible shackles during the penalty phase, as it
forbids their use during the guilt phase, unless that use is ""justified by an
essential state interest"" -- such as the interest in courtroom security --
specific to the defendant on trial.  Holbrook v. Flynn, 475 U.S. 560, 568-569,
89 L. Ed. 2d 525, 106 S. Ct. 1340 (1986); see also  Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S.
337, 343-344, 25 L. Ed. 2d 353, 90 S. Ct. 1057 (1970).

[***960]  I

In July 1996, petitioner Carman Deck robbed, shot, and killed an elderly couple.
In 1998, the State of Missouri tried Deck  [**2010]  for the murders and the
robbery. At trial, state authorities required Deck to wear leg braces that
apparently were not visible to the jury. App. 5; Tr. of Oral Arg. 21, 25,
[*625]  29. Deck was convicted and sentenced to death. The State Supreme Court
upheld Deck's conviction but set aside the sentence.  68 S. W. 3d 418, 432
(2002)(en banc). The State then held a new sentencing proceeding.

From the first day of the new proceeding, Deck was shackled with leg irons,
handcuffs, and a belly chain. App. 58. Before the jury voir dire began, Deck's
counsel objected to the shackles. The objection was overruled. Ibid.; see also
id., at 41-55. During the voir dire, Deck's counsel renewed the objection. The
objection was again overruled, the court stating that Deck ""has been convicted
and will remain in legirons and a belly chain."" Id., at 58.  After the voir
dire, Deck's counsel once again objected, moving to strike the jury panel
""because of the fact that Mr. Deck is shackled in front of the jury and makes
them think that he is . . . violent today."" Id., at 58-59. The objection was
again overruled, the court stating that his ""being shackled takes any fear out
of their minds."" Id., at 59. The penalty phase then proceeded with Deck in
shackles. Deck was again sentenced to death.  136 S. W. 3d 481, 485 (Mo. 2004)
(en banc).

On appeal, Deck claimed that his shackling violated both Missouri law and the
Federal Constitution. The Missouri Supreme Court rejected these claims, writing
that there was ""no record of the extent of the jury's awareness of the
restraints""; there was no ""claim that the restraints impeded"" Deck ""from
participating in the proceedings""; and there was ""evidence"" of ""a risk"" that
Deck ""might flee in that he was a repeat offender"" who may have ""killed his two
victims to avoid being returned to custody."" Ibid. Thus, there was ""sufficient
evidence in the record to support the trial court's exercise of its discretion""
to require shackles, and in any event Deck ""has not demonstrated that the
outcome of his trial was prejudiced . . . . Neither being viewed in shackles by
the venire panel prior to trial, nor being viewed while restrained throughout
the entire trial, alone, is proof of prejudice.""  [*626]  Ibid. The court
rejected Deck's other claims of error and affirmed the sentence.

We granted certiorari to review Deck's claim that his shackling violated the
Federal Constitution.

II

We first consider whether, as a general matter, the Constitution permits a State
to use visible shackles routinely in the guilt phase of a criminal trial. The
answer is clear: The law has long forbidden routine use of visible shackles
during the guilt phase; it permits a State to shackle a criminal defendant only
in the presence of a special need.

This rule has deep roots in the common law. In the 18th century, Blackstone
wrote that ""it is laid down in our antient books, that, though under an
indictment of the highest nature,"" a defendant ""must be brought to the bar
without irons, or any manner of shackles or bonds; unless there be evident
danger of an  [***961]  escape."" 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of
England 317 (1769) (footnote omitted); see also 3 E. Coke, Institutes of the
Laws of England *34 (""If felons come in judgement to answer, . . . they shall be
out of irons, and all manner of bonds, so that their pain shall not take away
any manner of reason, nor them constrain to answer, but at their free will"").
Blackstone and other English authorities recognized that the rule did not apply
at ""the time of arraignment,"" or like proceedings before the judge. Blackstone,
supra, at 317; see also Trial of Christopher  [**2011]  Layer, 16 How. St. Tr.
94, 99 (K. B. 1722). It was meant to protect defendants appearing at trial
before a jury. See King v. Waite, 1 Leach 28, 36, 168 Eng. Rep. 117, 120 (K. B.
1743) (""Being put upon his trial, the Court immediately ordered [the
defendant's] fetters to be knocked off"").

American courts have traditionally followed Blackstone's ""ancient"" English rule,
while making clear that ""in extreme and exceptional cases, where the safe
custody of the prisoner and the peace of the tribunal imperatively demand, the
manacles  [*627]  may be retained."" 1 J. Bishop, New Criminal Procedure § 955,
p. 573 (4th ed. 1895); see also id., at 572-573 (""One at the trial should have

about the degree of discretion to be afforded trial judges, see post, at 643-648
(THOMAS, J., dissenting), they settled virtually without exception on a basic
rule embodying notions of fundamental fairness: Trial courts may not shackle
defendants routinely, but only if there is a particular reason to do so.

More recently, this Court has suggested that a version of this rule forms part
of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments' due process guarantee. Thirty-five years
ago, when considering the trial of an unusually obstreperous criminal defendant,
the Court held that the Constitution sometimes permitted special measures,
including physical restraints.  Allen, 397 U.S., at 343-344, 25 L. Ed. 2d 353,
90 S. Ct. 1057. The Court wrote that ""binding  [*628]  and gagging might
possibly be the fairest and most reasonable way to handle"" such a defendant.  Id
., at 344, 25 L. Ed. 2d 353, 90 S. Ct. 1057. But the  [***962]  Court
immediately added that ""even to contemplate such a technique . . . arouses a
feeling that no person should be tried while shackled and gagged except as a
last resort."" Ibid.

Sixteen years later, the Court considered a special courtroom security
arrangement that involved having uniformed security personnel sit in the first
row of the courtroom's spectator section. The Court held that the Constitution
allowed the arrangement, stating that the deployment of security personnel
during trial is not ""the sort of inherently prejudicial practice that, like
shackling, should be permitted only where justified by an essential state
interest specific to each trial.""  Holbrook, 475 U.S., at 568-569, 89 L. Ed. 2d
525, 106 S. Ct. 1340. See also  Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S. 501, 503, 505, 48
L. Ed. 2d 126, 96 S. Ct. 1691 (1976) (making a defendant appear in prison garb
poses such a threat to the ""fairness of the factfinding process"" that it must be
justified by an ""essential state policy"").

[**2012]  Lower courts have treated these statements as setting forth a
constitutional standard that embodies Blackstone's rule. Courts and commentators
share close to a consensus that, during the guilt phase of a trial, a criminal
defendant has a right to remain free of physical restraints that are visible to
the jury; that the right has a constitutional dimension; but that the right may
be overcome in a particular instance by essential state interests such as
physical security, escape prevention, or courtroom decorum. See, e.g.,  Dyas v.
Poole, 309 F.3d 586, 588-589 (CA9 2002) (per curiam);  Harrell v. Israel, 672
F.2d 632, 635 (CA7 1982) (per curiam);  State v. Herrick, 2004 MT 323, 324 Mont.

Am. Jur. 2d, Criminal Law §§ 1016, 1019 (1998); see generally Krauskopf,
Physical Restraint of the Defendant in the Courtroom,  15 St. Louis U. L. J. 351
(1970-1971); ABA Standards for Criminal Justice: Discovery and Trial by Jury
15-3.2, pp. 188-191 (3d ed. 1996).

Lower courts have disagreed about the specific procedural steps a trial court
must take prior to shackling, about the amount and type of evidence needed to
justify restraints, and about what forms of prejudice might warrant a new trial,
but they have not questioned the basic principle. They have emphasized the
importance of preserving trial court discretion (reversing only in cases of
clear abuse), but they have applied the limits on that discretion described in
Holbrook, Allen, and the early English cases. In light of this precedent, and of
a lower court consensus disapproving routine shackling dating back to the 19th
century, it is clear that this Court's prior  [***963]  statements gave voice to
a principle deeply embedded in the law. We now conclude that those statements
identify a basic element of the ""due process of law"" protected by the Federal
Constitution. Thus,  [HN2] the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the use
of physical restraints visible to the jury absent a trial court determination,
in the exercise of its discretion, that they are justified by a state interest
specific to a particular trial. Such a determination may of course take into
account the factors that courts have traditionally relied on in gauging
potential security problems and the risk of escape at trial.

[*630]  III

We here consider shackling not during the guilt phase of an ordinary criminal
trial, but during the punishment phase of a capital case. And we must decide
whether that change of circumstance makes a constitutional difference. To do so,
we examine the reasons that motivate the guilt-phase constitutional rule and
determine whether they apply with similar force in this context.

A

Judicial hostility to shackling may once primarily have reflected concern for
the  [**2013]  suffering -- the ""tortures"" and ""torments"" -- that ""very painful""
chains could cause. Krauskopf, supra, at 351, 353 (internal quotation marks
omitted); see also  Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 154, n. 4, 118 L. Ed. 2d
479, 112 S. Ct. 1810 (1992) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (citing English cases
curbing the use of restraints). More recently, this Court's opinions have not
stressed the need to prevent physical suffering (for not all modern physical
restraints are painful). Instead they have emphasized the importance of giving
effect to three fundamental legal principles.

First, the criminal process presumes that the defendant is innocent until proved
guilty.  Coffin v. United States, 156 U.S. 432, 453, 39 L. Ed. 481, 15 S. Ct.
394 (1895) (presumption of innocence ""lies at the foundation of the
administration of our criminal law""). Visible shackling undermines the
presumption of innocence and the related fairness of the factfinding process.
Cf.  Estelle, supra, at 503, 48 L. Ed. 2d 126, 96 S. Ct. 1691. It suggests to
the jury that the justice system itself sees a ""need to separate a defendant
from the community at large.""  Holbrook, supra, at 569, 89 L. Ed. 2d 525, 106 S.
Ct. 1340; cf.  State v. Roberts, 86 N. J. Super., at 162, 206 A. 2d, at 202
(""[A] defendant 'ought not be brought to the Bar in a contumelious Manner; as
with his Hands tied together, or any other Mark of Ignominy and Reproach . . .
unless there be some Danger of a Rescous [rescue] or Escape'"" (quoting 2 W.
Hawkins, Pleas  [*631]  of the Crown, ch. 28, § 1, p. 308 (1716-1721) (section
on arraignments))).

Second, the Constitution, in order to help the accused secure a meaningful
defense, provides him with a right to counsel. See, e.g., Amdt. 6;  Gideon v.
Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 340-341, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799, 83 S. Ct. 792 (1963). The
use of physical restraints diminishes that right. Shackles can interfere with
the accused's ""ability to communicate"" with his lawyer.  Allen, 397 U.S., at
344, 25 L. Ed. 2d 353, 90 S. Ct. 1057. Indeed, they can interfere with a
defendant's ability to participate in his own defense, say by freely choosing
whether to take the witness stand on his own behalf. Cf. Cranburne's Case, 13
[***964]  How. St. Tr. 222 (K. B. 1696) (""Look you, keeper, you should take off
the prisoners irons when they are at the bar, for they should stand at their
ease when they are tried"" (footnote omitted));  People v. Harrington, 42 Cal.,
at 168 (shackles ""impose physical burdens, pains, and restraints . . ., . . .
tend to confuse and embarrass"" defendants'""mental faculties,  "" and thereby tend
""materially to abridge and prejudicially affect his constitutional rights"").

Third, judges must seek to maintain a judicial process that is a dignified
process. The courtroom's formal dignity, which includes the respectful treatment
of defendants, reflects the importance of the matter at issue, guilt or
innocence, and the gravity with which Americans consider any deprivation of an
individual's liberty through criminal punishment. And it reflects a seriousness
of purpose that helps to explain the judicial system's power to inspire the
confidence and to affect the behavior of a general public whose demands for
justice our courts seek to serve. The routine use of shackles in the presence of
juries would undermine these symbolic yet concrete objectives. As this Court has
said, the use of shackles at trial ""affronts"" the ""dignity and decorum of
judicial proceedings that the judge is seeking to uphold.""  Allen, supra, at
344, 25 L. Ed. 2d 353, 90 S. Ct. 1057; see also Trial of Christopher Layer, 16
How. St. Tr., at 99 (statement of Mr. Hungerford) (""To have a man plead for his
life"" in shackles before [*632]  ""a court of justice, the highest in the kingdom
for criminal matters,  where the king himself is supposed to be personally
present,"" undermines the ""dignity of the Court"").

[**2014]  There will be cases, of course, where these perils of shackling are
unavoidable. See  Allen, supra, at 344, 25 L. Ed. 2d 353, 90 S. Ct. 1057. We do
not underestimate the need to restrain dangerous defendants to prevent courtroom
attacks, or the need to give trial courts latitude in making individualized
security determinations. We are mindful of the tragedy that can result if judges
are not able to protect themselves and their courtrooms. But given their
prejudicial effect, due process does not permit the use of visible restraints if
the trial court has not taken account of the circumstances of the particular
case.

B

The considerations that militate against the routine use of visible shackles
during the guilt phase of a criminal trial apply with like force to penalty
proceedings in capital cases. This is obviously so in respect to the latter two
considerations mentioned, securing a meaningful defense and maintaining
dignified proceedings. It is less obviously so in respect to the first
consideration mentioned, for the defendant's conviction means that the
presumption of innocence no longer applies.  Hence shackles do not undermine the
jury's effort to apply that presumption.

Nonetheless, shackles at the penalty phase threaten related concerns. Although
the jury is no longer deciding between guilt and innocence, it is deciding
between life and death. That decision, given the ""'severity'"" and ""'finality'""
of the sanction, is no less important than the decision about guilt.  Monge v.
California, 524 U.S. 721, 732, 141 L. Ed. 2d 615, 118 S. Ct. 2246 (1998)
(quoting  Gardner v.  [***965]  Florida, 430 U.S. 349, 357, 51 L. Ed. 2d 393, 97
S. Ct. 1197 (1977)).

Neither is accuracy in making that decision any less critical. The Court has
stressed the ""acute need"" for reliable decisionmaking when the death penalty is
at issue.  Monge, supra, at 732, 141 L. Ed. 2d 615, 118 S. Ct. 2246 (citing
Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604, 57 L. Ed. 2d 973, 98 S. Ct. 2954 (1978)
[*633]  (plurality opinion)). The appearance of the offender during the penalty
phase in shackles, however, almost inevitably implies to a jury, as a matter of
common sense, that court authorities consider the offender a danger to the
community -- often a statutory aggravator and nearly always a relevant factor in
jury decisionmaking, even where the State does not specifically argue the point.
Cf. Brief for Respondent 25-27. It also almost inevitably affects adversely the
jury's perception of the character of the defendant. See  Zant v. Stephens, 462
U.S. 862, 900, 77 L. Ed. 2d 235, 103 S. Ct. 2733 (1983) (REHNQUIST, J.,
concurring in judgment) (character and propensities of the defendant are part of
a ""unique, individualized judgment regarding the punishment that a particular
person deserves""). And it thereby inevitably undermines the jury's ability to
weigh accurately all relevant considerations -- considerations that are often
unquantifiable and elusive -- when it determines whether a defendant deserves
death. In these ways, the use of shackles can be a ""thumb [on] death's side of
the scale.""  Sochor v. Florida, 504 U.S. 527, 532, 119 L. Ed. 2d 326, 112 S. Ct.
2114 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also  Riggins, 504 U.S., at
142, 118 L. Ed. 2d 479, 112 S. Ct. 1810 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment)
(through control of a defendant's appearance, the State can exert a ""powerful
influence on the outcome of the trial"").

Given the presence of similarly weighty considerations, we must conclude that
[HN3] courts cannot routinely place defendants in shackles or other physical
restraints visible to the jury during the penalty phase of a capital proceeding.
The constitutional requirement, however, is not absolute. It  [**2015]  permits
a judge, in the exercise of his or her discretion, to take account of special
circumstances, including security concerns, that may call for shackling. In so
doing, it accommodates the important need to protect the courtroom and its
occupants. But any such determination must be case specific; that is to say, it
should reflect particular concerns, say, special security needs or escape risks,
related to the defendant on trial.

[*634]  IV

Missouri claims that the decision of its high court meets the Constitution's
requirements in this case. It argues that the Missouri Supreme Court properly
found: (1) that the record lacks evidence that the jury saw the restraints; (2)
that the trial court acted within its discretion; and, in any event, (3) that
the defendant suffered no prejudice. We find these arguments unconvincing.

The first argument is inconsistent with the record in this case, which makes
clear that the jury was aware of the shackles. See App. 58-59 (Deck's attorney
stated on the record that ""Mr. Deck [was] shackled in front of the jury""
(emphasis added)); id., at 59 (trial court responded that ""him being shackled
takes any fear out of their minds""). The argument also overstates the Missouri
Supreme Court's holding. The court  [***966]  said: ""Trial counsel made no
record of the extent of the jury's awareness of the restraints throughout the
penalty phase, and Appellant does not claim that the restraints impeded him from
participating in the proceedings.""  136 S. W. 3d, at 485 (emphasis added). This
statement does not suggest that the jury was unaware of the restraints. Rather,
it refers to the degree of the jury's awareness, and hence to the kinds of
prejudice that might have occurred.

The second argument -- that the trial court acted within its discretion --
founders on the record's failure to indicate that the trial judge saw the matter
as one calling for discretion. The record contains no formal or informal
findings. Cf. supra, at 632 (requiring a case-by-case determination). The judge
did not refer to a risk of escape -- a risk the State has raised in this Court,
see Tr. of Oral Arg. 36-37 -- or a threat to courtroom security. Rather, he gave
as his reason for imposing the shackles the fact that Deck already ""has been
convicted."" App. 58. While he also said that the shackles would ""tak[e] any fear
out of"" the juror's ""minds,"" he nowhere explained any special reason for fear.
Id., at 59. Nor did he explain why, if shackles were necessary, he chose  [*635]
not to provide for shackles that the jury could not see -- apparently the
arrangement used at trial. If there is an exceptional case where the record
itself makes clear that there are indisputably good reasons for shackling, it is
not this one.

The third argument fails to take account of this Court's statement in Holbrook
that shackling is ""inherently prejudicial.""  475 U.S., at 568, 89 L. Ed. 2d 525,
106 S. Ct. 1340. That statement is rooted in our belief that the practice will
often have negative effects, but -- like ""the consequences of compelling a
defendant to wear prison clothing"" or of forcing him to stand trial while
medicated -- those effects ""cannot be shown from a trial transcript.""  Riggins,
supra, at 137, 118 L. Ed. 2d 479, 112 S. Ct. 1810. Thus,  [HN4] where a court,
without adequate justification, orders the defendant to wear shackles that will
be seen by the jury, the defendant need not demonstrate actual prejudice to make
out a due process violation. The State must prove ""beyond a reasonable doubt
that the [shackling] error complained of did not contribute to the verdict
obtained.""  Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705,  [**2016]
87 S. Ct. 824 (1967).

For these reasons, the judgment of the Missouri Supreme Court is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

DISSENT BY: THOMAS

DISSENT

JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins, dissenting.

Carman Deck was convicted of murdering and robbing an elderly couple. He stood
before the sentencing jury not as an innocent man, but as a convicted double
murderer and robber. Today this Court holds that Deck's due process rights were
violated when he appeared at sentencing in leg irons, handcuffs, and a belly
chain. The Court holds that such restraints may only be used where the use is
""'justified by an essential  [***967]  state interest'"" that is ""specific to the
defendant [*636]  on trial,"" ante, at 624, and that is supported by specific
findings by the trial court. Tradition -- either at English common law or among
the States -- does not support this conclusion. To reach its result, the Court
resurrects an old rule the basis for which no longer exists. It then needlessly
extends the rule from trials to sentencing. In doing so, the Court pays only
superficial heed to the practice of States and gives conclusive force to errant
dicta sprinkled in a trio of this Court's cases. The Court's holding defies
common sense and all but ignores the serious security issues facing our courts.
I therefore respectfully dissent.

I

Carman Deck and his sister went to the home of Zelma and James Long on a summer
evening in 1996. After waiting for nightfall, Deck and his sister knocked on the
door of the Longs' home, and when Mrs. Long answered, they asked for directions.
Mrs. Long invited them in, and she and Mr. Long assisted them with directions.
When Deck moved toward the door to leave, he drew a pistol, pointed it at the
Longs, and ordered them to lie face down on their bed. The Longs did so,
offering up money and valuables throughout the house and all the while begging
that he not harm them.

After Deck finished robbing their house, he stood at the edge of their bed,
deliberating for 10 minutes over whether to spare them. He ignored their pleas
and shot them each twice in the head. Deck later told police that he shot the
Longs because he thought that they would be able to recognize him.

Deck was convicted of the murders and robbery of the Longs and sentenced to
death. The death sentence was overturned on appeal. Deck then had another
sentencing hearing, at which he appeared in leg irons, a belly chain, and
handcuffs. At the hearing, the jury heard evidence of Deck's numerous burglary
and theft convictions and his assistance in a jailbreak by two prisoners.

[*637]  On resentencing, the jury unanimously found six aggravating factors:
Deck committed the murders while engaged in the commission of another unlawful
homicide; Deck murdered each victim for the purpose of pecuniary gain; each
murder involved depravity of mind; each murder was committed for the purpose of
avoiding a lawful arrest; each murder was committed while Deck was engaged in a
burglary; and each murder was committed while Deck was engaged in a robbery. The
jury recommended, and the trial court imposed, two death sentences.

Deck sought postconviction relief from his sentence, asserting, among other
[**2017]  things, that his due process and equal protection rights were violated
by the trial court's requirement that he appear in shackles. The Missouri
Supreme Court rejected that claim.  136 S. W. 3d 481 (2004) (en banc). The court
reasoned that ""there was a risk that [Deck] might flee in that he was a repeat
offender and evidence from the guilt phase of his trial indicated that he killed
his two victims to avoid being returned to custody,"" and thus it could not
conclude that the trial court had abused its discretion.  Id., at 485.

II

My legal obligation is not to determine the wisdom or the desirability  [***968]
of shackling defendants, but to decide a purely legal question: Does the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment preclude the visible shackling of a
defendant? Therefore, I examine whether there is a deeply rooted legal principle
that bars that practice.  Medina v. California, 505 U.S. 437, 446, 120 L. Ed. 2d
353, 112 S. Ct. 2572 (1992);  Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 500, 147 L.
Ed. 2d 435, 120 S. Ct. 2348 (2000) (THOMAS, J., concurring); see also  Chicago
v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 102-106, 144 L. Ed. 2d 67, 119 S. Ct. 1849 (1999)
(THOMAS, J., dissenting). As I explain below, although the English common law
had a rule against trying a defendant in irons, the basis for the rule makes
clear that it should not be extended by rote to modern restraints, which are
dissimilar in certain essential respects to the irons that gave rise to  [*638]
the rule. Despite the existence of a rule at common law, state courts did not
even begin to address the use of physical restraints until the 1870's, and the
vast majority of state courts would not take up this issue until the 20th
century, well after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. Neither the
earliest case nor the more modern cases reflect a consensus that would inform
our understanding of the requirements of due process. I therefore find this
evidence inconclusive.

A

English common law in the 17th and 18th centuries recognized a rule against
bringing the defendant in irons to the bar for trial. See, e.g., 4 W.
Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 317 (1769); 3 Coke, Institutes
of the Laws of England *34 (hereinafter Coke). This rule stemmed from none of
the concerns to which the Court points, ante, at 630-633 -- the presumption of
innocence, the right to counsel, concerns about decorum, or accuracy in
decisionmaking. Instead, the rule ensured that a defendant was not so distracted
by physical pain during his trial that he could not defend himself. As one
source states, the rule prevented prisoners from ""any Torture while they made
their defence, be their Crime never so great."" J. Kelyng, A Report of Divers
Cases in Pleas of the Crown 10 (1708). 1 This concern was understand"
"               RODERICK JACKSON, Petitioner v. BIRMINGHAM BOARD OF                                    EDUCATION",544 U.S. 167,"

 [*171]   [**1502]  Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A] Roderick Jackson, a teacher in the Birmingham, Alabama, public
schools, brought suit against the Birmingham Board of Education (Board) alleging
that the Board retaliated against him because he had complained about sex
discrimination in the high school's athletic program.  Jackson claimed that the
Board's retaliation violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Pub L
92-318, 86 Stat 373, as amended, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. The District Court
dismissed Jackson's complaint on the ground that Title IX does not prohibit
retaliation, and the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.   309
F.3d 1333 (2002).  We consider here whether the private right of action implied
by Title IX encompasses claims of retaliation. We hold that it does where the
funding recipient retaliates against an individual because he has complained
about sex discrimination.

I

[***LEdHR2] [2]   [HN1] Because Jackson's Title IX claim was dismissed under
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which
relief can be granted,  [**1503]  ""we must assume the truth of the material
facts as alleged in the complaint.""  Summit Health, Ltd. v. Pinhas, 500 U.S.
322, 325, 114 L. Ed. 2d 366, 111 S. Ct. 1842 (1991).

According to the complaint, Jackson has been an employee of the Birmingham
school district for over 10 years.  In 1993, the Board hired Jackson to serve as
a physical education teacher and girls' basketball coach.  Jackson was
transferred to Ensley High School in August 1999.  At Ensley, he discovered that
the girls' team was not receiving equal funding and equal access to athletic
equipment and facilities.  The lack of adequate funding, equipment, and
facilities made it difficult for Jackson to do his job as the team's coach.

In December 2000, Jackson began complaining to his supervisors about the unequal
treatment of the girls' basketball team, but to no avail.  Jackson's complaints
went unanswered, and the school failed to remedy the situation.  Instead,
[*172]  Jackson began to receive negative work evaluations and ultimately was
removed as the girls' coach in May 2001.  Jackson is still employed by the Board
as a teacher, but he no longer receives supplemental pay for coaching.

After the Board terminated Jackson's coaching duties, he filed suit in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.  He alleged,
among other things, that the Board violated Title IX by retaliating against him
for protesting the discrimination against the girls' basketball team. Amended
Complaint 2-3, App. 10-11.  The Board moved to dismiss on the ground that Title
IX's private cause of action does not include claims of retaliation. The
District Court granted the motion to dismiss.

The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.   309 F.3d 1333
[***370]  (2002).  It assumed, for purposes of the appeal, that the Board
retaliated against Jackson for complaining about Title IX violations.  It then
held that Jackson's suit failed to state a claim because Title IX does not
provide a private right of action for retaliation, reasoning that ""[n]othing in
the text indicates any congressional concern with retaliation that might be
visited on those who complain of Title IX violations.""  Id., at 1344.  Relying
on our decision in  Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 149 L. Ed. 2d 517, 121
S. Ct. 1511 (2001), the Court of Appeals also concluded that a Department of
Education regulation expressly prohibiting retaliation does not create a private
cause of action for retaliation: ""Because Congress has not created a right
through Title IX to redress harms resulting from retaliation, [the regulation]
may not be read to create one either.""  309 F.3d, at 1346.  Finally, the court
held that, even if Title IX prohibits retaliation, Jackson would not be entitled
to relief because he is not within the class of persons protected by the
statute.

We granted certiorari, 542 U.S. 903, 159 L. Ed. 2d 266, 124 S. Ct. 2834 (2004),
to resolve a conflict in the Circuits over whether Title IX's private right of
action encompasses claims of retaliation for complaints about sex
discrimination. Compare  Lowrey v. Texas A & M  [*173]  Univ. System, 117 F.3d
242, 252 (CA5 1997) (""[T]itle IX affords an implied cause of action for
retaliation"");  Preston v. Virginia ex rel. New River Community College, 31 F.3d
203, 206 (CA4 1994) (same), with the case below, supra.

[HN2] Title IX prohibits sex discrimination by recipients of federal education
funding. The statute provides that ""[n]o person in the United States shall, on
the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied [**1504]  the
benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or
activity receiving Federal financial assistance."" 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  More
than 25 years ago, in  Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 690-693,
60 L. Ed. 2d 560, 99 S. Ct. 1946 (1979), we held that Title IX implies a private
right of action to enforce its prohibition on intentional sex discrimination. In
subsequent cases, we have defined the contours of that right of action. In
Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60, 117 L. Ed. 2d 208, 112
S. Ct. 1028 (1992), we held that it authorizes private parties to seek monetary
damages for intentional violations of Title IX.  We have also held that the
private right of action encompasses intentional sex discrimination in the form
of a recipient's deliberate indifference to a teacher's sexual harassment of a
student,  Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 290-291,
141 L. Ed. 2d 277, 118 S. Ct. 1989 (1998), or to sexual harassment of a student
by another student,  Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Ed., 526 U.S. 629, 642, 143
L. Ed. 2d 839, 119 S. Ct. 1661 (1999).

[***LEdHR1A] [1B] In all of these cases, we relied on the text of  [HN3] Title
IX, which, subject to a list of narrow exceptions not at issue here, broadly
prohibits a funding recipient from subjecting any person to ""discrimination"" ""on
the basis of sex."" 20 U.S.C. § 1681. Retaliation against a person because that
person has complained of sex discrimination is another  [***371]  form of
intentional sex discrimination encompassed by Title IX's private cause of
action. Retaliation is, by definition, an intentional  [*174]  act.  It is a
form of ""discrimination"" because the complainant is being subjected to
differential treatment.  See generally  Olmstead v. L. C., 527 U.S. 581, 614,
144 L. Ed. 2d 540, 119 S. Ct. 2176 (1999) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment)
(the ""normal definition of discrimination"" is ""differential treatment""); see
also  Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462 U.S. 669, 682, n.
22, 77 L. Ed. 2d 89, 103 S. Ct. 2622 (1983) (discrimination means ""less
favorable"" treatment).  Moreover, retaliation is discrimination ""on the basis of
sex"" because it is an intentional response to the nature of the complaint: an
allegation of sex discrimination. We conclude that when a funding recipient
retaliates against a person because he complains of sex discrimination, this
constitutes intentional ""discrimination"" ""on the basis of sex,"" in violation of
Title IX.

[***LEdHR1A] [1C]  [***LEdHR3] [3] The Court of Appeals' conclusion that Title
IX does not prohibit retaliation because the ""statute makes no mention of
retaliation,""  309 F.3d, at 1344, ignores the import of our repeated holdings
construing ""discrimination"" under Title IX broadly.  Though the statute does not
mention sexual harassment, we have held that sexual harassment is intentional
discrimination encompassed by Title IX's private right of action.  Franklin, 503
U.S., at 74-75, 117 L. Ed. 2d 208, 112 S. Ct. 1028; see also  id., at 75, 117 L.
Ed. 2d 208, 112 S. Ct. 1028 (noting that, under  Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v.
Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 64, 91 L. Ed. 2d 49, 106 S. Ct. 2399 (1986), ""'when a
supervisor sexually harasses a subordinate because of the subordinate's sex,
that supervisor ""discriminate[s]"" on the basis of sex,'"" and holding that ""the
same rule should apply when a teacher sexually harasses . . . a student"").
Thus, a recipient's deliberate indifference to a teacher's sexual harassment of
a student also ""violate[s] Title IX's plain terms.""  Davis, supra, at 643, 143
L. Ed. 2d 839, 119 S. Ct. 1661 (citing  Gebser, supra, at 290-291, 141 L. Ed. 2d
277, 118 S. Ct. 1989).  Likewise, a recipient's deliberate indifference to
sexual harassment of a student by another student also squarely constitutes
""discrimination"" ""on the basis of sex.""  Davis, 526 U.S., at 643, 143 L. Ed. 2d
839, 119 S. Ct. 1661; see also  id., at [**1505]  650, 143 L. Ed. 2d 839, 119 S.
Ct. 1661 (""Having previously determined that 'sexual harassment' is
'discrimination' . . . under Title IX, we are constrained to conclude  [*175]
that student-on-student sexual harassment, if sufficiently severe, can likewise
rise to the level of discrimination actionable under the statute"").
""Discrimination"" is a term that covers a wide range of intentional unequal
treatment; by using such a broad term, Congress gave the statute a broad reach.
See  North Haven Bd. of Ed. v. Bell, 456 U.S. 512, 521, 72 L. Ed. 2d 299, 102 S.
Ct. 1912 (1982) (Courts ""'must accord'"" Title IX ""'a sweep as broad as its
language'"").

[***LEdHR4] [4] Congress certainly could have mentioned retaliation in Title IX
expressly, as it did in § 704 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78
Stat 257, as amended, 86 Stat 109, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a)  (providing that it is
an ""unlawful employment practice"" for an employer to retaliate against an
employee because he has ""opposed any practice made an unlawful employment
[***372]  practice by [Title VII], or because he has made a charge, testified,
assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or
hearing under [Title VII]"").  Title VII, however, is a vastly different statute
from Title IX, see  Gebser, 524 U.S., at 283-284, 286-287, 141 L. Ed. 2d 277,
118 S. Ct. 1989, and the comparison the Board urges us to draw is therefore of
limited use.  Title IX's cause of action is implied, while Title VII's is
express.  See  id., at 283-284, 141 L. Ed. 2d 277, 118 S. Ct. 1989.  Title IX is
a broadly written general prohibition on discrimination, followed by specific,
narrow exceptions to that broad prohibition.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1681. By contrast,
Title VII spells out in greater detail the conduct that constitutes
discrimination in violation of that statute.  See 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-2 (giving
examples of unlawful employment practices), 2000e-3 (prohibiting ""[o]ther
unlawful employment practices,"" including (a) ""[d]iscrimination"" in the form of
retaliation; and (b) the discriminatory practice of ""[p]rinting or publication
of notices or advertisements indicating prohibited preference . . ."").  Because
Congress did not list any specific discriminatory practices when it wrote Title
IX, its failure to mention one such practice does not tell us anything about
whether it intended that practice to be covered.

[*176]   [***LEdHR1A] [1D] Title IX was enacted in 1972, three years after our
decision in  Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U.S. 229, 24 L. Ed. 2d
386, 90 S. Ct. 400 (1969).  In Sullivan, we held that Rev Stat § 1978, 42 U.S.C.
§ 1982, which provides that ""[a]ll citizens of the United States shall have the
same right . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens . . . to inherit, purchase,
lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property,"" protected a white man
who spoke out against discrimination toward one of his tenants and who suffered
retaliation as a result.  Sullivan had rented a house to a black man and
assigned him a membership share and use rights in a private park.  The
corporation that owned the park would not approve the assignment to the black
lessee. Sullivan protested, and the corporation retaliated against him by
expelling him and taking his shares.  Sullivan sued the corporation, and we
upheld Sullivan's cause of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1982 for ""[retaliation] for
the advocacy of [the black person's] cause.""  396 U.S., at 237, 24 L. Ed. 2d
386, 90 S. Ct. 400.  Thus, in Sullivan we interpreted a general prohibition on
racial discrimination to cover retaliation against those who advocate the rights
of groups protected by that prohibition. 1

1 Justice Thomas contends that Sullivan merely decided that the white owner had
standing to assert the rights of the black lessee.  Post, at 194, 161 L. Ed. 2d,
at 384 (dissenting opinion).  But Sullivan's holding was not so limited.  It
plainly held that the white owner could maintain his own private cause of action
under § 1982 if he could show that he was ""punished for trying to vindicate the
rights of minorities.""  396 U.S., at 237, 24 L. Ed. 2d 386, 90 S. Ct. 400.

 [***LEdHR1A] [1E]  [***LEdHR5] [5]  [**1506]  Congress enacted Title IX just
three years after Sullivan was decided, and accordingly that decision provides a
valuable context for understanding the statute.  As we recognized in Cannon, ""it
is not only appropriate but also realistic to presume that Congress was
thoroughly familiar with [Sullivan] and that it expected its enactment [of Title
IX]  [***373]  to be interpreted in conformity with [it].""  441 U.S., at 699, 60
L. Ed. 2d 560, 99 S. Ct. 1946; see also  id., at 698, n. 22, 60 L. Ed. 2d 560,
99 S. Ct. 1946.  Retaliation for Jackson's advocacy of the rights of the girls'
basketball team in this case is ""discrimination""  [*177]  ""on the basis of sex,""
just as retaliation for advocacy on behalf of a black lessee in Sullivan was
discrimination on the basis of race.

The Board contends that our decision in  Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275,
149 L. Ed. 2d 517, 121 S. Ct. 1511 (2001), compels a holding that Title IX's
private right of action does not encompass retaliation. Sandoval involved an
interpretation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat 252, as
amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq., which provides in § 601 that no person
shall, ""on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from
participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination
under any program or activity"" covered by Title VI.  42 U.S.C. § 2000d.  Section
602 of Title VI authorizes federal agencies to effectuate the provisions in §
601 by enacting regulations. Pursuant to that authority, the Department of
Justice promulgated regulations prohibiting funding recipients from adopting
policies that had ""the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination
because of their race, color, or national origin."" 28 C.F.R. § 42.104(b)(2)
(1999).  The Sandoval petitioners brought suit to enjoin an English-only policy
of the Alabama Department of Public Safety on grounds that it disparately
impacted non-English speakers in violation of the regulations. Though we assumed
that the regulations themselves were valid, see  532 U.S., at 281, 149 L. Ed. 2d
517, 121 S. Ct. 1511, we rejected the contention that the private right of
action to enforce intentional violations of Title VI encompassed suits to
enforce the disparate-impact regulations. We did so because ""[i]t is clear . . .
that the disparate-impact regulations do not simply apply § 601 --since they
indeed forbid conduct that § 601 permits--and therefore clear that the private
right of action to enforce § 601 does not include a private right to enforce
these regulations. ""  Id., at 285, 149 L. Ed. 2d 517, 121 S. Ct. 1511.  See also
Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511
U.S. 164, 173, 128 L. Ed. 2d 119, 114 S. Ct. 1439  [*178]  (1994) (A ""private
plaintiff may not bring a [suit based on a regulation] against a defendant for
acts not prohibited by the text of [the statute]"").  Thus, Sandoval held that
private parties may not invoke Title VI regulations to obtain redress for
disparate-impact discrimination because Title VI itself prohibits only
intentional discrimination.

[***LEdHR1A] [1F]  [***LEdHR6A] [6A] The Board cites a Department of Education
regulation prohibiting retaliation ""against any individual for the purpose of
interfering with any right or privilege secured by [Title IX],"" 34 C.F.R. §
100.7(e) (2004) (incorporated by reference by § 106.71), and contends that
Jackson, like the petitioners in Sandoval, seeks an ""impermissible extension of
the statute"" when he argues that Title IX's private right of action encompasses
retaliation. Brief for Respondent 45.  This argument, however, entirely misses
the point.  We do not rely [**1507]  on regulations extending Title IX's
protection beyond its statutory limits; indeed, we do not rely on  [***374]  the
Department of Education's regulation at all,  because the statute itself
contains the necessary prohibition.  As we explain above, see  supra, at
174-175, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 370-371, the text of Title IX prohibits a funding
recipient from retaliating against a person who speaks out against sex
discrimination, because such retaliation is intentional ""discrimination"" ""on the
basis of sex."" We reach this result based on the statute's text.  In step with
Sandoval, we hold that Title IX's private right of action encompasses suits for
retaliation, because retaliation falls within the statute's prohibition of
intentional discrimination on the basis of sex. 2

2  [***LEdHR6A] [6B] We agree with Justice Thomas that plaintiffs may not assert
claims under Title IX for conduct not prohibited by that statute.   Post, at
193, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 383-384 (dissenting opinion).  See also  Central Bank of
Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U.S. 164, 173, 128
L. Ed. 2d 119, 114 S. Ct. 1439 (1994) (""[T]he private plaintiff may not bring a
10b-5 suit against a defendant for acts not prohibited by the text of § 10(b)"").
But we part ways with regard to our reading of the statute.  We interpret Title
IX's text to clearly prohibit retaliation for complaints about sex
discrimination.

  [*179]  C

[***LEdHR1A] [1G] Nor are we convinced by the Board's argument that, even if
Title IX's private right of action encompasses discrimination, Jackson is not
entitled to invoke it because he is an ""indirect victi[m]"" of sex
discrimination. Brief for Respondent 33.  The statute is broadly worded;  [HN4]
it does not require that the victim of the retaliation must also be the victim
of the discrimination that is the subject of the original complaint.  If the
statute provided instead that ""no person shall be subjected to discrimination on
the basis of such individual's sex,"" then we would agree with the Board.  Cf. 42
U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1) (""It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an
employer . . . to discriminate against any individual . . . because of such
individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin"" (emphasis added)).
However, Title IX contains no such limitation.  Where the retaliation occurs
because the complainant speaks out about sex discrimination, the ""on the basis
of sex"" requirement is satisfied.  The complainant is himself a victim of
discriminatory retaliation, regardless of whether he was the subject of the
original complaint. 3 As we explain above, see  supra, at 176-177, 161 L. Ed.
2d, at 372-373, this is consistent with Sullivan, which formed an important part
[*180]  of the backdrop against which Congress enacted Title IX.  Sullivan made
clear that retaliation claims extend to those who oppose discrimination against
others.   [***375]  See  396 U.S., at 237, 24 L. Ed. 2d 386, 90 S. Ct. 400
(holding that a person may bring suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1982 if he can show that
he was ""punished for trying to vindicate the rights of minorities"").

3 Justice Thomas contends that ""extending the implied cause of action under
Title IX to claims of retaliation expands the class of people the statute
protects beyond the specified beneficiaries.""  Post, at 194, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at
384 (dissenting opinion).  But Title IX's beneficiaries plainly include all
those who are subjected to ""discrimination"" ""on the basis of sex."" 20 U.S.C. §
1681(a).  Because, as we explain above, see  supra, at 174-175, 161 L. Ed. 2d,
at 370-371, retaliation in response to a complaint about sex discrimination is
""discrimination"" ""on the basis of sex,"" the statute clearly protects those who
suffer such retaliation. The following hypothetical, offered by petitioner at
oral argument, illustrates this point: If the male captain of the boys'
basketball team and the female captain of the girls' basketball team together
approach the school principal to complain about discrimination against the
girls' team, and the principal retaliates by expelling them both from the honor
society, then both the female and the male captains have been ""discriminated""
against ""on the basis of sex."" Tr. of Oral Arg. 53-54.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  [***LEdHR7] [7] Congress enacted Title IX not only to prevent the use of
federal dollars to support discriminatory practices, but also ""to provide
individual citizens effective protection against those practices.""  Cannon, 441
U.S., at 704, 60 L. Ed. 2d 560, 99 S. Ct. 1946.  We agree with the United States
that this objective ""would be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve if
persons who complain about sex discrimination did not have effective protection
against retaliation."" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13.  If
recipients were permitted to retaliate freely, individuals who witness
discrimination would be loathe to report it, and all manner of Title IX
violations might go unremedied as a result.  See  Sullivan, supra, at 237, 24 L.
Ed. 2d 386, 90 S. Ct. 400 (noting that without protection against retaliation,
the underlying discrimination is perpetuated).

Reporting incidents of discrimination is integral to Title IX enforcement and
would be discouraged if retaliation against those who report went unpunished.
Indeed, if retaliation were not prohibited, Title IX's enforcement scheme would
unravel.  Recall that Congress intended Title IX's private right of action to
encompass claims of a recipient's deliberate indifference to sexual harassment.
See generally  Davis, 526 U.S. 629, 143 L. Ed. 2d 839, 119 S. Ct. 1661.
Accordingly, if a principal sexually harasses a student, and a teacher complains
to the school board but the school board is indifferent, the board would likely
be liable for a Title IX violation.  See generally  Gebser, 524 U.S. 274, 141 L.
Ed. 2d 277, 118 S. Ct. 1989.  But if Title IX's private right of action does not
encompass retaliation claims, the teacher would have no recourse if he were
subsequently fired for speaking out.  Without protection from retaliation,
individuals who witness discrimination would likely not report it, indifference
[*181]  claims would be short circuited, and the underlying discrimination would
go unremedied.

[***LEdHR8] [8] Title IX's enforcement scheme also depends on individual
reporting because individuals and agencies may not bring suit under the statute
unless the recipient has received ""actual notice"" of the discrimination.   Id.,
at 288, 289-290, 141 L. Ed. 2d 277, 118 S. Ct. 1989 (holding that an appropriate
official of the funding recipient must have actual knowledge of discrimination
and respond with deliberate indifference before a private party may bring suit);
20 U.S.C. § 1682 (providing that a federal agency may terminate funding only
after it ""has advised the appropriate person or persons of the failure to comply
with the requirement and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by
voluntary means"").  If recipients were able to avoid such notice by retaliating
against all those who dare complain, the statute's enforcement scheme would be
subverted.  We should not assume that Congress left such a gap in its scheme.

Moreover, teachers and coaches such as Jackson are often in the best position to
vindicate the rights of their students because they are better able to identify
discrimination and bring it to the attention of administrators.  Indeed,
sometimes adult employees are ""'the only effective  [***376]  adversar[ies]'"" of
discrimination in schools.  See  Sullivan, supra, at 237, 24 L. Ed. 2d 386, 90
S. Ct. 400 (""[A] white owner is at times 'the only effective adversary' of the
unlawful restrictive covenant"" (citing  Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U.S. 249, 259,
97 L. Ed. 1586, 73 S. Ct. 1031 (1953))).

[***LEdHR9] [9] The Board is correct in pointing out that,  [HN5] because Title
IX was enacted as an exercise of Congress' powers under the Spending Clause,
see, e.g.,  Davis, supra, at 640, 143 L. Ed. 2d 839, 119 S. Ct. 1661;  Gebser,
supra, at 287, 141 L. Ed. 2d 277, 118 S. Ct. 1989;  Franklin, 503 U.S., at
74-75, and n. 8, 117 L. Ed. 2d 208, 112 S. Ct. 1028, ""private [**1509]  damages
actions are available only where recipients of federal funding had adequate
notice that they could be liable for the conduct at issue,""  Davis, supra, at
640, 143 L. Ed. 2d 839, 119 S. Ct. 1661.  When Congress  [*182]  enacts
legislation under its spending power, that legislation is ""in the nature of a
contract: in return for federal funds, the States agree to comply with federally
imposed conditions.""  Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S.
1, 17, 67 L. Ed. 2d 694, 101 S. Ct. 1531 (1981).  As we have recognized,
""[t]here can . . . be no knowing acceptance [of the terms of the contract] if a
State is unaware of the conditions [imposed by the legislation on its receipt of
funds]."" Ibid.

[***LEdHR10A] [10A] The Board insists that we should not interpret Title IX to
prohibit retaliation because it was not on notice that it could be held liable
for retaliating against those who complain of Title IX violations.  We disagree.
Funding recipients have been on notice that they could be subjected to private
suits for intentional sex discrimination under Title IX since 1979, when we
decided Cannon. Pennhurst does not preclude private suits for intentional acts
that clearly violate Title IX.   Davis, supra, at 642, 143 L. Ed. 2d 839, 119 S.
Ct. 1661.

Indeed, in Davis, we held that Pennhurst did not pose an obstacle to private
suits for damages in cases of a recipient's deliberate indifference to one
student's sexual harassment of another, because the deliberate indifference
constituted intentional discrimination on the basis of sex.  Davis, supra, at
650, 143 L. Ed. 2d 839, 119 S. Ct. 1661.  See also  Franklin, supra, at 75, 117
L. Ed. 2d 208, 112 S. Ct. 1028 (""Congress surely did not intend for federal
moneys to be expended to support the intentional actions it sought by statute to
proscribe"").  Similarly, we held in Gebser that a recipient of federal funding
could be held liable for damages under Title IX for deliberate indifference to a
teacher's harassment of a student.   524 U.S., at 287-288, 141 L. Ed. 2d 277,
118 S. Ct. 1989.  In Gebser, as in Davis, we acknowledged that federal funding
recipients must have notice that they will be held liable for damages.  See
Davis, supra, at 642, 143 L. Ed. 2d 839, 119 S. Ct. 1661;  Gebser, supra, at
287, 141 L. Ed. 2d 277, 118 S. Ct. 1989.  But we emphasized that ""this
limitation on private damages actions is not a bar to liability where a funding
recipient intentionally violates the statute.""  Davis, supra, at 642, 143 L. Ed.
2d 839, 119 S. Ct. 1661 (citing  Franklin, 503 U.S., at 74-75, 117 L. Ed. 2d
208, 112 S. Ct. 1028).  See also ibid. (""[T]he [Pennhurst] notice problem does
not  [*183]  arise in a case such as this, in which intentional discrimination
is alleged"");  Bennett v. Kentucky Dep't of  [***377]  Education, 470 U.S. 656,
665-666, 84 L. Ed. 2d 590, 105 S. Ct. 1544 (1985) (holding that there was
sufficient notice under Pennhurst where a statute made clear that some
conditions were placed on the receipt of federal funds, and stating that
Congress need not ""specifically identif[y] and proscrib[e]"" each condition in
the legislation).  Simply put, ""Pennhurst does not bar a private damages action
under Title IX where the funding recipient engages in intentional conduct that
violates the clear terms of the statute.""  Davis, supra, at 642, 143 L. Ed. 2d.
839, 119 S. Ct. 1661.

[***LEdHR1A] [1H]  [***LEdHR10A] [10B] Thus, the Board should have been put on
notice by the fact that our cases since Cannon, such as Gebser and Davis, have
consistently interpreted Title IX's private cause of action broadly to encompass
diverse forms of intentional sex discrimination. Indeed, retaliation presents an
even easier case than deliberate indifference. It is easily attributable to the
funding recipient, and it is always--by definition--intentional.  We therefore
conclude that retaliation against individuals because they complain of sex
discrimination is ""intentional conduct that violates the clear terms of the
statute,""  Davis, 526 U.S., at 642, 143 L. Ed. 2d 839, 119  [**1510]  S. Ct.
1661, and that Title IX itself therefore supplied sufficient notice to the Board
that it could not reta"

 [*283]   [**1521]  Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A] This case concerns what has come to be known as the
Rooker-Feldman doctrine, applied by this Court only twice, first in  Rooker v.
Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413, 68 L. Ed. 362, 44 S. Ct. 149 (1923), then, 60
years later, in  District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462,
75 L. Ed. 2d 206, 103 S. Ct. 1303 (1983).  Variously interpreted in the lower
courts, the doctrine has sometimes been construed to extend far beyond the
contours of the Rooker and Feldman cases, overriding Congress' conferral of
federal-court jurisdiction concurrent with jurisdiction exercised by state
courts, and superseding the ordinary application of  [***461]  preclusion law
pursuant to 28 USC § 1738 [28 USCS § 1738].  See, e.g.,  Moccio v. New York
State Office of Court Admin., 95 F.3d 195, 199-200 (CA2 1996).

Rooker was a suit commenced in Federal District Court to have a judgment of a
state court, adverse to the federal court plaintiffs, ""declared null and void.""
263 U.S., at 414, 68 L. Ed. 362, 44 S. Ct. 149.  In Feldman, parties
unsuccessful in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals (the District's
highest court) commenced a federal-court action against the very court that had
rejected their applications.  Holding the federal suits impermissible, we
emphasized that appellate jurisdiction to reverse or modify a state-court
judgment is lodged, initially by § 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat 85,
and now by 28 U.S.C. § 1257 [28 USCS § 1257], exclusively in this Court.
Federal district courts, we noted, are empowered to exercise original, not
appellate, jurisdiction.  Plaintiffs in Rooker and Feldman had litigated and
lost in state court.  Their federal complaints, we observed, essentially invited
federal courts of first instance to review and reverse unfavorable state-court
judgments.  We  [*284]  declared such suits out of bounds, i.e., properly
dismissed for want of subject-matter jurisdiction.

[HN1] The  Rooker- Feldman doctrine, we hold today, is confined to cases of the
kind from which the doctrine acquired its name: cases brought by state-court
losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court [**1522]  judgments
rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district
court review and rejection of those judgments.  Rooker-Feldman does not
otherwise override or supplant preclusion doctrine or augment the circumscribed
doctrines that allow federal courts to stay or dismiss proceedings in deference
to state-court actions.

[***LEdHR2A] [2A] In the case before us, the Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit misperceived the narrow ground occupied by Rooker-Feldman, and
consequently erred in ordering the federal action dismissed for lack of
subject-matter jurisdiction.  We therefore reverse the Third Circuit's judgment.

In  Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413, 68 L. Ed. 362, 44 S. Ct. 149,
the parties defeated in state court turned to a Federal District Court for
relief.  Alleging that the adverse state-court judgment was rendered in
contravention of the Constitution, they asked the federal court to declare it
""null and void.""  Id., at 414-415, 68 L. Ed. 362, 44 S. Ct. 149.  This Court
noted preliminarily that the state court had acted within its jurisdiction.
Id., at 415, 68 L. Ed. 362, 44 S. Ct. 149.  If the state-court decision was
wrong, the Court explained, ""that did not make the judgment void, but merely
left it open to reversal or modification in an appropriate and timely appellate
proceeding."" Ibid. Federal district courts, the Rooker Court recognized, lacked
the requisite appellate authority, for their jurisdiction was ""strictly
original.""  Id., at 416, 68 L. Ed. 362, 44 S. Ct. 149.  Among federal courts,
the Rooker Court clarified, Congress had empowered only this Court to exercise
appellate authority ""to reverse or modify"" a state-court judgment.  Ibid.
[*285]  Accordingly, the Court affirmed a decree dismissing the suit for lack of
jurisdiction.   Id., at 415, 417, 68 L. Ed. 362, 44 S. Ct. 149.

[***462]  Sixty years later, the Court decided  District of Columbia Court of
Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 75 L. Ed. 2d 206, 103 S. Ct. 1303.  The two
plaintiffs in that case, Hickey and Feldman, neither of whom had graduated from
an accredited law school, petitioned the District of Columbia Court of Appeals
to waive a court Rule that required D. C. bar applicants to have graduated from
a law school approved by the American Bar Association.  After the D. C. court
denied their waiver requests, Hickey and Feldman filed suits in the United
States District Court for the District of Columbia.   Id., at 465-473, 75 L. Ed.
2d 206, 103 S. Ct. 1303.  The District Court and the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit disagreed on the question whether the federal suit
could be maintained, and we granted certiorari.   Id., at 474-475, 75 L. Ed. 2d
206, 103 S. Ct. 1303.

Recalling Rooker, this Court's opinion in Feldman observed first that the
District Court lacked authority to review a final judicial determination of the
D. C. high court.  ""Review of such determinations,"" the Feldman opinion
reiterated, ""can be obtained only in this Court.""  460 U.S., at 476, 75 L. Ed.
2d 206, 103 S. Ct. 1303.  The ""crucial question,"" the Court next stated, was
whether the proceedings in the D. C. court were ""judicial in nature."" Ibid.
Addressing that question, the Court concluded that the D. C. court had acted
both judicially and legislatively.

In applying the accreditation Rule to the Hickey and Feldman waiver petitions,
this Court determined, the D. C. court had acted judicially.   Id., at 479-482,
75 L. Ed. 2d 206, 103 S. Ct. 1303.  As to that adjudication, Feldman held, this
Court alone among federal courts had review authority.  Hence, ""to the extent
that Hickey and Feldman sought review in the District Court of the District of
Columbia Court of Appeals' denial of their petitions for waiver, the District
[**1523]  Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over their complaints.""  Id.,
at 482, 75 L. Ed. 2d 206, 103 S. Ct. 1303.  But that determination did not
dispose of the entire case, for in promulgating  [*286]  the bar admission rule,
this Court said, the D. C. court had acted legislatively, not judicially.   Id.,
at 485-486, 75 L. Ed. 2d 206, 103 S. Ct. 1303.  ""Challenges to the
constitutionality of state bar rules,"" the Court elaborated, ""do not necessarily
require a United States district court to review a final state-court judgment in
a judicial proceeding.""  Id., at 486, 75 L. Ed. 2d 206, 103 S. Ct. 1303.  Thus,
the Court reasoned, 28 U.S.C. § 1257 [28 USCS § 1257] did not bar District Court
proceedings addressed to the validity of the accreditation Rule itself.
Feldman, 460 U.S., at 486, 75 L. Ed. 2d 206, 103 S. Ct. 1303.  The Rule could be
contested in federal court, this Court held, so long as plaintiffs did not seek
review of the Rule's application in a particular case. Ibid.

The Court endeavored to separate elements of the Hickey and Feldman complaints
that failed the jurisdictional threshold from those that survived jurisdictional
inspection.  Plaintiffs had urged that the District of Columbia Court of Appeals
acted arbitrarily in denying the waiver petitions of Hickey and Feldman, given
that court's ""former policy of granting waivers to graduates of unaccredited law
schools."" Ibid. That charge, the Court held, could not be pursued, for it was
""inextricably intertwined with the District of Columbia  [***463]  Court of
Appeals' decisions, in judicial proceedings, to deny [plaintiffs'] petitions.""
Id., at 486-487, 75 L. Ed. 2d 206, 103 S. Ct. 1303. 1

1 Earlier in the opinion the Court had used the same expression.  In a footnote,
the Court explained that a district court could not entertain constitutional
claims attacking a state-court judgment, even if the state court had not passed
directly on those claims, when the constitutional attack was ""inextricably
intertwined"" with the state court's judgment.   Feldman, 460 U.S., at 482, n.
16, 75 L. Ed. 2d 206, 103 S. Ct. 1303 (1983).

 On the other hand, the Court said, plaintiffs could maintain ""claims that the
[bar admission] rule is unconstitutional because it creates an irrebuttable
presumption that only graduates of accredited law schools are fit to practice
law, discriminates against those who have obtained equivalent legal training by
other means, and impermissibly delegates the District of Columbia Court of
Appeals' power to regulate the  [*287]  bar to the American Bar Association,""
for those claims ""do not require review of a judicial decision in a particular
case.""  Id., at 487, 75 L. Ed. 2d 206, 103 S. Ct. 1303.  The Court left open the
question whether the doctrine of res judicata foreclosed litigation of the
elements of the complaints spared from dismissal for want of subject-matter
jurisdiction.   Id., at 487-488, 75 L. Ed. 2d 206, 103 S. Ct. 1303.

Since Feldman, this Court has never applied Rooker-Feldman to dismiss an action
for want of jurisdiction.  The few decisions that have mentioned Rooker and
Feldman have done so only in passing or to explain why those cases did not
dictate dismissal.  See  Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of Md., 535
U.S. 635, 644, n. 3, 152 L. Ed. 2d 871, 122 S. Ct. 1753 (2002) (Rooker-Feldman
does not apply to a suit seeking review of state agency action);  Johnson v. De
Grandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1005-1006, 129 L. Ed. 2d 775, 114 S. Ct. 2647 (1994) (
Rooker-Feldman bars a losing party in state court ""from seeking what in
substance would be appellate review of the state judgment in a United States
district court, based on the losing party's claim that the state judgment itself

federal suit brought by a nonparty to the state suit.);  Howlett v. Rose, 496
U.S. 356, 369-370, n. 16, 110 L. Ed. 2d 332, 110 [**1524]  S. Ct. 2430 (1990)

2 Respondent Saudi Basic Industries Corp. urges that  ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490
U.S. 605, 104 L. Ed. 2d 696, 109 S. Ct. 2037 (1989), expanded Rooker-Feldman's
jurisdictional bar to include federal actions that simply raise claims
previously litigated in state court.  Brief for Respondent 20-22.  This is not
so.  In ASARCO, the petitioners (defendants below in the state-court action)
sought review in this Court of the Arizona Supreme Court's invalidation of a
state statute governing mineral leases on state lands.   490 U.S., at 610, 104
L. Ed. 2d 696, 109 S. Ct. 2037.  This Court dismissed the suggestion of the
United States that the petitioners should have pursued their claim as a new
action in federal district court.  Such an action, we said, ""in essence, would
be an attempt to obtain direct review of the Arizona Supreme Court's decision in
the lower federal courts"" in contravention of 28 U.S.C. § 1257 [28 USCS § 1257].
490 U.S., at 622-623, 104 L. Ed. 2d 696, 109 S. Ct. 2037.  The injury of which
the petitioners (the losing parties in state court) could have complained in the
hypothetical federal suit would have been caused by the state court's
invalidation of their mineral leases, and the relief they would have sought
would have been to undo the state court's invalidation of the statute.  The
hypothetical suit in ASARCO, therefore, shares the characteristics of the suits
in Rooker and Feldman, i.e., loser in state court invites federal district court
to overturn state-court judgment.

3 Between 1923, when the Court decided Rooker, and 1983, when it decided Feldman
, the Court cited Rooker in one opinion,  Fishgold v. Sullivan Drydock & Repair
Corp., 328 U.S. 275, 283, 90 L. Ed. 1230, 66 S. Ct. 1105 (1946), in reference to

or modified, [the state-court judgment] would be an effective and conclusive
adjudication."").  Rooker's only other appearance in the United States Reports
before 1983 occurs in Justice White's dissent from denial of certiorari in
Florida State Bd. of Dentistry v. Mack, 401 U.S. 960, 961, 28 L. Ed. 2d 245, 91

 [*289]  II

In 1980, two subsidiaries of petitioner Exxon Mobil Corporation (then the
separate [**1525]  companies Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp.) formed joint ventures
with respondent Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) to produce polyethylene in
Saudi Arabia.   194 F. Supp. 2d 378, 384 (NJ 2002).  Two decades later, the
parties began to dispute royalties that SABIC had charged the joint ventures for
sublicenses to a polyethylene manufacturing method.   364 F.3d 102, 103 (CA3
2004).

SABIC preemptively sued the two ExxonMobil subsidiaries in Delaware Superior
Court in July 2000 seeking a declaratory judgment that the royalty charges were
proper under the joint venture agreements.   194 F. Supp. 2d, at 385-386.  About
two weeks later, ExxonMobil and its subsidiaries countersued SABIC in the United
States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that SABIC
overcharged the joint ventures for the sublicenses.   Id., at 385; App 3.
ExxonMobil invoked subject-matter jurisdiction in the New Jersey action under 28
U.S.C. § 1330 [28 USCS § 1330], which authorizes  [***465]  district courts to
adjudicate actions against foreign states.   194 F. Supp. 2d, at 401. 4

In January 2002, the ExxonMobil subsidiaries answered SABIC's state-court
complaint, asserting as counterclaims the same claims ExxonMobil had made in the
federal suit in New Jersey.   364 F.3d, at 103.  The state suit went to trial in
March 2003, and the jury returned a verdict of over $400 million in favor of the
ExxonMobil subsidiaries.  Ibid.; Saudi Basic Industries Corp. v. Mobil Yanbu
Petrochemical Co., 866 A.2d 1, 11 (Del. 2005).  SABIC appealed the judgment
entered on the verdict to the Delaware Supreme Court.

Before the state-court trial, SABIC moved to dismiss the federal suit, alleging,
inter alia, immunity under the Foreign  [*290]  Sovereign Immunities Act of
1976, 28 U.S.C. § 1602 et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. II) [28 USCS §§ 1602 et seq.
].  The Federal District Court denied SABIC's motion to dismiss.   194 F. Supp.
2d, at 401-407, 416-417.  SABIC took an interlocutory appeal, and the Court of
Appeals heard argument in December 2003, over eight months after the state-court
jury verdict.  364 F.3d, at 103-104. 5

5 At ExxonMobil's request, the Court of Appeals initially stayed its
consideration of the appeal to await resolution of the proceedings in Delaware.
App 9-10.  In November 2003, shortly after SABIC filed its appeal in the
Delaware Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, on SABIC's motion, lifted the stay
and set the appeal for argument.   Id., at 11-13.

 The Court of Appeals, on its own motion, raised the question whether ""subject
matter jurisdiction over this case fails under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine
because ExxonMobil's claims have already been litigated in state court.""  Id.,
at 104. 6 The court did not question the District Court's possession of
subject-matter jurisdiction at the outset of the suit, but held that federal
jurisdiction terminated when the Delaware Superior Court entered judgment on the
jury verdict.  Id., at 104-105.  The court rejected ExxonMobil's argument that
Rooker-Feldman could not apply because ExxonMobil filed its federal complaint
well before the state-court judgment.  The only relevant consideration, the
court stated, ""is whether the state judgment precedes a federal judgment on the
same claims.""  364 F.3d, at 105.  If Rooker-Feldman did not apply to federal
actions filed prior to a [**1526]  state-court judgment, the Court of Appeals
worried, ""we would be encouraging parties to maintain federal actions as
'insurance policies' while their state court claims were pending.""  364 F.3d, at
105.  Once ExxonMobil's claims had been litigated to a judgment in state court,
the Court of Appeals held, Rooker-Feldman ""preclude[d] [the] federal district
court  [*291]  from proceeding.""  364 F.3d, at 104 (internal quotation marks
omitted).

ExxonMobil, at that point prevailing in Delaware, was not seeking to overturn
the state-court judgment.  Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals hypothesized that,
if SABIC won on appeal in Delaware, ExxonMobil would be endeavoring in the
federal action to ""invalidate"" the state-court  [***466]  judgment, ""the very
situation,"" the court concluded, ""contemplated by Rooker-Feldman's 'inextricably
intertwined' bar.""  Id., at 106.

of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine.  We now reverse the judgment of the Court of

[***LEdHR3A] [3B] SABIC contends that this case is moot because the Delaware
Supreme Court has affirmed the trial-court judgment in favor of ExxonMobil,
Saudi Basic Industries Corp. v. Mobil Yanbu Petrochemical Co., 866 A.2d 1 (2005)
, and has denied reargument en banc,  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. v. Mobil
Yanbu Petrochemical Co., No. 493, 2003 (Feb. 22, 2005).  Brief for Respondent

represented that it will petition this Court for a writ of certiorari.  Tr. of

[***LEdHR4A] [4A] Rooker and Feldman exhibit  [HN2] the limited circumstances in
which this Court's appellate jurisdiction over state-court judgments, 28 U.S.C.
§ 1257 [28 USCS § 1257], precludes a United States district court from
exercising subject-matter jurisdiction in an action it would otherwise be
empowered to adjudicate under a congressional grant of authority, e.g., § 1330
(suits against foreign states),  § 1331 (federal question), and § 1332
(diversity).  In both cases, the losing party in state court filed suit in
federal court after the state proceedings ended, complaining of an injury caused
by the state-court judgment and seeking review and rejection of that judgment.
Plaintiffs in both cases, alleging federal-question jurisdiction, called upon
[*292]  the District Court to overturn an injurious state-court judgment.
Because § 1257, as long interpreted, vests authority to review a state court's
judgment solely in this Court, e.g.,  Feldman, 460 U.S., at 476, 75 L. Ed. 2d
206, 103 S. Ct. 1303;  Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers, 398
U.S. 281, 286, 26 L. Ed. 2d 234, 90 S. Ct. 1739 (1970);  Rooker, 263 U.S., at
416, 68 L. Ed. 362, 44 S. Ct. 149, the District Courts in Rooker and Feldman
lacked subject-matter jurisdiction.  See  Verizon Md. Inc., 535 U.S., at 644, n.
3, 152 L. Ed. 2d 871, 122 S. Ct. 1753 (""The Rooker-Feldman doctrine merely
recognizes that 28 U.S.C. § 1331 [28 USCS § 1331] is a grant of original
jurisdiction, and does not authorize district courts to exercise appellate
jurisdiction over state-court judgments, which Congress has reserved to this
Court, see § 1257(a).""). 8

  [***LEdHR1A] [1B]  [HN3] When there is parallel state and federal litigation,
Rooker-Feldman is not triggered simply by the entry of judgment in state court.
This Court has repeatedly held that ""the pendency of an action in the [**1527]
state court is no bar to proceedings concerning the same matter in the Federal
court having jurisdiction.""  McClellan v. Carland, 217 U.S. 268, 282, 54 L. Ed.
762, 30 S. Ct. 501 (1910); accord  Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U.S. 922, 928,
45 L. Ed. 2d 648, 95 S. Ct. 2561 (1975);  Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 398 U.S.,
at 295, 26 L. Ed. 2d 234, 90 S. Ct. 1739.  Comity or abstention doctrines may,
in various circumstances, permit or require the federal court to stay or dismiss
the  [***467]  federal action in favor of the state-court litigation.  See,
e.g.,  Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800,
47 L. Ed. 2d 483, 96 S. Ct. 1236 (1976);  Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 27 L.
Ed. 2d 669, 91 S. Ct. 746 (1971);  Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315, 87 L.
Ed. 1424, 63 S. Ct. 1098 (1943);  Railroad Comm'n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312
U.S. 496, 85 L. Ed. 971, 61 S. Ct. 643 (1941).  But neither Rooker nor Feldman
supports the notion that properly invoked concurrent jurisdiction vanishes if a
state court reaches judgment on the same or related question while the case
remains sub judice in a federal court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1C]  [***LEdHR5A] [5A]  [*293]  Disposition of the federal action,
once the state-court adjudication is complete, would be governed by preclusion
law.   [HN4] The Full Faith and Credit Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1738 [28 USCS § 1738],
originally enacted in 1790, ch 11, 1 Stat 122, requires the federal court to
""give the same preclusive effect to a state-court judgment as another court of
that State would give.""  Parsons Steel, Inc. v. First Alabama Bank, 474 U.S.
518, 523, 88 L. Ed. 2d 877, 106 S. Ct. 768 (1986); accord  Matsushita Elec.
Industrial Co. v. Epstein, 516 U.S. 367, 373, 134 L. Ed. 2d 6, 116 S. Ct. 873
(1996);  Marrese v. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 470 U.S. 373,
380-381, 84 L. Ed. 2d 274, 105 S. Ct. 1327 (1985).   [HN5] Preclusion, of
course, is not a jurisdictional matter.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c) (listing
res judicata as an affirmative defense).  In parallel litigation, a federal
court may be bound to recognize the claim- and issue-preclusive effects of a
state-court judgment, but federal jurisdiction over an action does not terminate
automatically on the entry of judgment in the state court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1D]  [***LEdHR5A] [5B]   [HN6] Nor does § 1257 stop a district
court from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction simply because a party
attempts to litigate in federal court a matter previously litigated in state
court.  If a federal plaintiff ""present[s] some independent claim, albeit one
that denies a legal conclusion that a state court has reached in a case to which
he was a party . . ., then there is jurisdiction and state law determines
whether the defendant prevails under principles of preclusion.""  GASH Assocs. v.
Rosemont, 995 F.2d 726, 728 (CA7 1993); accord  Noel v. Hall, 341 F.3d 1148,
1163-1164 (CA9 2003).

[***LEdHR1A] [1E]  [***LEdHR6A] [6A] This case surely is not the ""paradigm
situation in which Rooker-Feldman precludes a federal district court from
proceeding.""  364 F.3d, at 104 (quoting  E. B. v. Verniero, 119 F.3d 1077,
1090-1091 (CA3 1997)).  ExxonMobil plainly has not repaired to federal court to
undo the Delaware judgment in its favor.  Rather, it appears ExxonMobil filed
suit in Federal District Court (only two weeks after SABIC filed in Delaware and
well before any judgment in state court) to  [*294]  protect itself in the event
it lost in state court on grounds (such as the state statute of limitations)
that might not preclude relief in the federal venue.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 46; App
35-36. 9Rooker-Feldman did not  [**1528]   [***468]  prevent the District Court
from exercising jurisdiction when ExxonMobil filed the federal action, and it
did not emerge to vanquish jurisdiction after ExxonMobil prevailed in the
Delaware courts.

9  [***LEdHR6A] [6B] The Court of Appeals criticized ExxonMobil for pursuing its
federal suit as an ""insurance policy"" against an adverse result in state court.
364 F.3d 102, 105-106 (CA3 2004).  There is nothing necessarily inappropriate,
however, about filing a protective action.  See, e.g.,  Rhines v. Weber, 544
U.S. 269, 161 L. Ed. 2d 440, 125 S. Ct. 1528, 2005 U.S. LEXIS 2930 (permitting a
federal district court to stay a federal habeas action and hold the petition in
abeyance while a petitioner exhausts claims in state court);  Union P. R. Co. v.
Department of Revenue, 920 F.2d 581, 584, and n. 9 (CA9 1990) (noting that the
railroad company had filed protective actions in state court to prevent
expiration of the state statute of limitations);  Government of Virgin Islands
v. Neadle, 861 F. Supp. 1054, 1055 (MD Fla. 1994) (staying an action brought by
plaintiffs ""to protect themselves"" in the event that personal jurisdiction over
the defendants failed in the United States District Court for the Virgin
Islands); see also  England v. Louisiana Bd. of Medical Examiners, 375 U.S. 411,
421, 11 L. Ed. 2d 440, 84 S. Ct. 461 (1964) (permitting a party to reserve
litigation of federal constitutional claims for federal court while a state
court resolves questions of state law).

 [*298]   [**1574]  Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A]  [***LEdHR2A] [2A] The question here is when the 1-year
statute of limitations in 28 U.S.C. § 2255, [28 USCS § 2255], P6(4), begins to
run in a case of a prisoner's [**1575]  collateral attack on his federal
sentence on the ground that a state conviction used to enhance that sentence has
since been vacated.  We hold that  [HN1] the period begins when a petitioner
receives notice of the order vacating the prior conviction, provided that he has
sought it with due diligence in state court, after entry of judgment in the
federal case with the enhanced sentence.

In 1994, petitioner Robert Johnson, Jr., was indicted for distributing cocaine
base and related conspiracy.  Following his guilty plea to a single count of
distribution in violation of 21 USC § 841(a)(1) [21 USCS § 841(a)(1)] and 18 USC
§ 2 [18 USCS § 2], the presentence investigation report recommended that Johnson
receive an enhanced sentence as a career offender under § 4B1.1 of the Federal
Sentencing Guidelines, owing to his two 1989 convictions by the State of Georgia
for distributing cocaine.  Without elaboration, Johnson filed an objection to
the recommendation, which he withdrew at the sentencing hearing.  The District
Court imposed the enhancement and entered judgment on November 29, 1994.

On appeal, Johnson argued for the first time that he should not have been
sentenced as a career offender because one of  [*299]  his Georgia convictions
was invalid. 1 The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the
sentence, finding that in the trial court Johnson had raised no objection to the
validity of his prior convictions and that the judge's career offender findings
were not clearly erroneous.   United States v. Johnson, 73 F.3d 1108, 1995 U.S.

Two days later,  [HN2] the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996
(AEDPA) went into effect, imposing, among other things, a 1-year period of
limitations on motions by prisoners seeking to modify their federal sentences:


      [HN3] ""The limitation period shall run from the latest of--

     ""(1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final;

     ""(2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by
     governmental action in violation of  [*300]  the Constitution or laws
     of the United States is removed, if the movant was prevented from
     making a motion by such governmental action;

     ""(3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by
     the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the
     Supreme Court [**1576]  and made retroactively applicable to cases on
     collateral review; or

     ""(4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims
     presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due
     diligence."" 28 USC § 2255 [28 USCS § 2255], P 6.



A fifth option supplied uniformly by the Courts of Appeals gave prisoners whose
convictions became final before AEDPA a 1-year grace period running from the new
statute's effective date.   Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 183, n. 1, 150 L.
Ed. 2d 251, 121 S. Ct. 2120 (2001) (Stevens, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment) (collecting cases).

On April 25, 1997, one year and three days after his pre-AEDPA federal
conviction became final and just after the 1-year grace period expired, Johnson
pro se filed a motion in the District Court for a 60-day extension of time to
attack his federal sentence under § 2255. 2 Finding the AEDPA period expired,
the District Court denied the motion, though it added that denial was without
prejudice to Johnson's right to file a § 2255 motion claiming any alternative
limitation period under the statute.

2 April 25, 1997, is the date Johnson's motion was stamped filed in the District
Court.  Johnson did not contend below, and nothing in the record indicates, that
his motion should have been deemed filed on an earlier date by operation of the
so-called prison mailbox rule, see  Houston v. Lack, 487 U.S. 266, 101 L. Ed. 2d

 On February 6, 1998, Johnson petitioned for writ of habeas corpus in the
Superior Court of Wayne County, Georgia, claiming the invalidity of his guilty
pleas in seven cases between 1983 and 1993 because he had not knowingly,
intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to counsel.  One of the seven
pleas Johnson challenged was the basis for one of  [*301]  the 1989 convictions
on which the District Court had rested the career offender enhancement of
Johnson's federal sentence. 3 The State of Georgia denied Johnson's allegations,
but  [***551]  filed no hearing transcripts.  The Superior Court found that the
records did ""not show an affirmative waiver of [Johnson's] right to an attorney""
in any of the cases, App 10, and entered an order of vacatur, that all seven
convictions be reversed, ibid.

his challenge within the Gideon exception, entitling him to attack the state
conviction collaterally in a timely § 2255 motion after enhancement of his
federal sentence, even without having first resorted to state court.  See  infra

 Just over three months later, Johnson was back in the Federal District Court
pro se with a motion under § 2255 to vacate the enhanced federal sentence
following the vacatur of one of its predicate state convictions.  He claimed his
motion was timely because the order vacating the state judgment was ""new
evidence"" not previously discoverable, and so the trigger of a renewed
limitation period. The Magistrate Judge took Johnson to be relying on the
discovery of ""facts supporting the claim"" addressed in § 2255, P6(4), but still
recommended denial of the motion for failure on Johnson's part to exercise the
""due diligence"" required by that provision.  Id., at 15-17.  Although Johnson
objected that lack of education excused him from acting more promptly, and that
he had filed the state petition as soon as he could get help from an inmate law
clerk, the District Court denied the § 2255 motion as untimely.  In the court's
view, the applicable limitation was the 1-year grace period that was over in
April 1997, which Johnson had done nothing to toll in the 21 months he waited
after his conviction became final [**1577]  before filing his state habeas
petition.  Id., at 19.

A divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed.   340 F.3d 1219 (CA11 2003).
The majority reasoned that the state-court order vacating the prior state
conviction was not  [*302]  a ""'fact'"" under the fourth paragraph of the § 2255
limitation rule.   Id., at 1223.  In the majority's view, the state-court order
was properly classified as a ""legal proposition"" or a ""court action obtained at
the behest of a federal prisoner, not 'discovered' by him."" Ibid. Because the
fourth paragraph of the limitation rule was therefore of no avail to Johnson,
the Court of Appeals majority agreed with the District Court that the time for
filing expired in 1997, at the end of the 1-year grace period.  Id., at 1226.
The majority also agreed that Johnson had no equitable claim to toll the running
of the 1-year period because he had waited too long before going back to the
state court.   Id., at 1226-1228.  Judge Roney dissented, arguing that the state
court's order was a ""fact"" supporting Johnson's § 2255 motion, a fact not
discoverable prior to the order's issuance.   Id., at 1228-1229.  Over one
dissent, rehearing en banc was denied.   353 F.3d 1328 (2003).

We granted certiorari,  542 U.S. 965, 542 U.S. 965, 159 L. Ed. 2d 857, 125 S.
Ct. 26 (2004), to resolve a disagreement among the Courts of Appeals as to
whether vacatur of a prior state conviction used to enhance a federal sentence
can start the 1-year limitation period under the fourth alternative of the §
2255 rule.  Compare  340 F.3d 1219 (case below) (vacatur not a trigger);
Brackett v. United States, 270 F.3d 60 (CA1 2001) (same), with  United States v.
Gadsen, 332 F.3d 224 (CA4 2003) (vacatur a fact not previously discoverable
giving rise to a new 1-year period).

[***LEdHR1A] [1B] We agree with Johnson that  [***552]  the state-court vacatur
is a matter of fact for purposes of the limitation rule in the fourth paragraph.
But we also hold that the statute allows the fact of the state-court order to
set the 1-year period running only if the petitioner has shown due diligence in
seeking the order.  Applying that qualification, we affirm.

II

[***LEdHR3] [3] The Government shares Johnson's preliminary assumption that if
he filed his § 2255 motion in time, he is entitled to  [*303]  federal
resentencing now that the State has vacated one of the judgments supporting his
enhanced sentence. Neither the enhancement provision of the Sentencing
Guidelines applied here, nor the mandatory enhancement under the Armed Career
Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 USC § 924(e) [18 USCS § 924(e)], has been read to mean
that the validity of a prior conviction supporting an enhanced federal sentence
is beyond challenge.  Cf.  Lewis v. United States, 445 U.S. 55, 63 L. Ed. 2d
198, 100 S. Ct. 915 (1980) (validity of prior conviction irrelevant under
federal statute prohibiting possession of a firearm by a felon).  Our cases
applying these provisions assume the contrary, that a defendant given a sentence
enhanced for a prior conviction is entitled to a reduction if the earlier
conviction is vacated.   Custis v. United States, 511 U.S. 485, 128 L. Ed. 2d
517, 114 S. Ct. 1732 (1994);  Daniels v. United States, 532 U.S. 374, 149 L. Ed.
2d 590, 121 S. Ct. 1578 (2001).

Such was the premise in  Custis v. United States, supra,, even though we held
that the ACCA generally created no opportunity to attack a prior state
conviction collaterally at a federal sentencing proceeding,  511 U.S., at 490,
128 L. Ed. 2d 517, 114 S. Ct. 1732, and that the Constitution demands no more,
id., at 496-497, 128 L. Ed. 2d 517, 114 S. Ct. 1732.  We thought that Congress
had not meant to make it so easy to challenge final judgments that every
[**1578]  occasion to enhance a sentence for recidivism would turn a federal
sentencing court into a forum for difficult and time-consuming reexaminations of
stale state proceedings.  Ibid. We recognized only one exception to this rule
that collateral attacks were off-limits, and that was for challenges to state
convictions allegedly obtained in violation of the right to appointed counsel,
an exception we thought necessary to avoid undermining  Gideon v. Wainwright,
372 U.S. 335, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799, 83 S. Ct. 792 (1963).   Custis v. United States,
511 U.S., at 494-496, 128 L. Ed. 2d 517, 114 S. Ct. 1732.  As to challenges
falling outside of that exception, we pointed out that  [HN4] a defendant who
successfully attacked his state conviction in state court or on federal habeas
review could then ""apply for reopening of any federal sentence enhanced by the
state sentences.""  Id., at 497, 128 L. Ed. 2d 517, 114 S. Ct. 1732.

[*304]   Daniels v. United States, supra,  extended Custis to hold, subject to
the same exception for Gideon claims, that a federal prisoner may not attack a
predicate state conviction through a § 2255 motion challenging an enhanced
federal sentence,  532 U.S., at 376, 149 L. Ed. 2d 590, 121 S. Ct. 1578, and
again we stressed considerations of administration and finality,  id., at
378-380, 149 L. Ed. 2d 590, 121 S. Ct. 1578.  Again, too, we acknowledged that a
prisoner could proceed under § 2255 after successful review of the prior
[***553]  state conviction on federal habeas under § 2254 or favorable resort to
any postconviction process available under state law,  id., at 381, 149 L. Ed.
2d 590, 121 S. Ct. 1578.  We simply added that if the prior conviction was no
longer open to direct or collateral attack in its own right, the federal
prisoner could do nothing more about his sentence enhancement.  Id., at 382, 149
L. Ed. 2d 590, 121 S. Ct. 1578. 4

4 The Daniels Court allowed that ""there may be rare cases in which no channel of
review was actually available to a defendant with respect to a prior conviction,
due to no fault of his own,"" in which case a prisoner might be able to use a
motion under § 2255 to challenge the prior conviction as well as the federal
sentence based on it.   532 U.S., at 383-384, 149 L. Ed. 2d 590, 121 S. Ct. 1578
.  As in Daniels, the circumstances of this case do not call for further
exploration of that possibility.

 This case presents the distinct issue of how soon a prisoner, successful in his
state proceeding, must challenge the federal sentence under § 2255.  The
resolution turns on understanding what ""facts"" affecting an enhanced sentence
could most sensibly fall within that term as used in the fourth paragraph of the
§ 2255 limitation provision, under which the one year runs from ""the date on
which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been
discovered through the exercise of due diligence."" Johnson says that the order
vacating his prior conviction is the factual matter supporting his § 2255 claim,
discovery of which triggers the refreshed 1-year period.  The Court of Appeals
majority said no because it understood a legally operative order of vacatur to
be a mandate of law or a consequence of applying law, and therefore distinct
from a matter of ""'fact'""  [*305]  as Congress used the term in § 2255.   340
F.3d, at 1223.  The United States does not endorse that law-fact distinction,
but argues that the facts supporting Johnson's § 2255 claim, for purposes of the
fourth paragraph, are the facts on which he based his challenge to the validity
of his state convictions.

We think none of these positions is sound, at least in its entirety.  As for the
Government's proposed reading, certainly it is true that the circumstances
rendering the underlying predicate conviction invalid are ultimate subjects of
fact supporting the § 2255 claim, in the sense that proof of those facts (or the
government's failure to negate them) is necessary to vacate the [**1579]  prior
state conviction and eliminate the ground for the federal enhancement. But this
is not enough to fit the Government's position comfortably into paragraph four.
[HN5] The text of § 2255, P6(4), clearly links the running of the limitation
period to the discovery of the ""facts supporting the claim or claims presented,""
but on the Government's view, the statute of limitations may begin to run (and
may even expire) before the § 2255 claim and its necessary predicate even exist.
Prior to the federal conviction, a petitioner has no § 2255 claim because he has
no enhanced federal sentence to challenge; and prior to the state vacatur, which
Daniels makes a necessary condition for relief in most cases, a petitioner
cannot obtain relief under § 2255.  Cf.  Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning
Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corp. of Cal., 522 U.S. 192, 195, 139 L. Ed. 2d
553, 118 S. Ct. 542 (1997) (statutes of limitations ordinarily do not begin to
run until a plaintiff's complete cause of action has accrued).  Hence, it is
highly  [***554]  doubtful that in § 2255 challenges to enhanced sentences
Congress would have meant to start the period running under paragraph four on
the discoverability date of facts that may have no significance under federal
law for years to come and that cannot by themselves be the basis of a § 2255
claim, supra, at 376.

There are further reasons against applying the fourth paragraph as the
Government would.  Congress does not  [*306]  appear to have adopted a policy of
enhancing federal sentences regardless of the validity of state convictions
relied on for the enhancement.  Custis and Daniels were decided on just the
contrary, and unchallenged, understanding; it would certainly push the limits of
coherence for the Court now to apply the fourth paragraph in a way that would
practically close the door to relief that each of those cases specifically left
open. 5 Nor is there any reason to think Congress meant the limitation period to
run earlier for the sake of preserving finality of state convictions; States are
capable of providing their own limitations periods (and most of them would have
barred Johnson's challenge). 6

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - Footnotes - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

5 It is also doubtful that Congress meant the federal limitation period to begin
running, let alone expire, at a time when a typical state convict will have no
inducement under federal law to act.  On the Government's reading, in fact, a
defendant could be obligated to act at a time when he had no real incentive for
questioning the state conviction.  Many of those convictions that in time become
predicates for enhancing later sentences are, like the one here, the
consequences of guilty pleas entered on terms defendants are willing to accept.
Thus, a federal limitation rule obligating a defendant to turn around and attack
a state guilty plea he has just entered would in practice place most predicate
convictions beyond challenge as a matter of federal law.

6 At the time Johnson filed his state habeas petition, Georgia law would have
permitted him to wait indefinitely before seeking reversal of his 1989
convictions.  The Georgia Legislature amended the state habeas statute in 2004
to create a 4-year statute of limitations for petitions for writs of habeas
corpus.  Ga. Code Ann. § 9-14-42 (Lexis Supp. 2004).

 Johnson's argument improves on the Government's proposal by pegging the
limitation period to notice of the state order eliminating the predicate
required for enhancement, which is almost always necessary and always sufficient
for relief.  We do not find his proposal vulnerable to the point made by the
majority of the Court of Appeals, that an order vacating a conviction is legally
expressive or operative language that may not be treated as a matter of fact
within the meaning of the statute.  We commonly speak of the ""fact of  [*307]  a
prior conviction,"" e.g.,   Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490,  [**1580]
147 L. Ed. 2d 435, 120 S. Ct. 2348 (2000), and an order vacating a predicate
conviction is spoken of as a fact just as sensibly as the order entering it.  In
either case, a claim of such a fact is subject to proof or disproof like any
other factual issue.

But Johnson's take on the statute carries anomalies of its own, one minor, one
more serious.  It is strange to say that an order vacating a conviction has been
""discovered,"" the term used by paragraph four, and stranger still to speak about
the date on which it could have been discovered with due diligence, when the
fact happens to be the outcome of a proceeding in which the § 2255 petitioner
was the moving party.  By bringing that proceeding, the petitioner causes the
factual event to occur,  [***555]  after all, and unless his mail goes astray
his prompt discovery of the crucial fact is virtually guaranteed through
official notice.

A more serious problem is Johnson's position that his § 2255 petition is timely
under paragraph four as long as he brings it within a year of learning he
succeeded in attacking the prior conviction, no matter how long he may have
slumbered before starting the successful proceeding.  If Johnson were right
about this, a petitioner might wait a long time before raising any question
about a predicate conviction, as this very case demonstrates.  Of course it may
well be that Johnson took his time because his basic sentence had years to run
before the period of enhancement began.  But letting a petitioner wait for as
long as the enhancement makes no difference to his actual imprisonment, while
the predicate conviction grows increasingly stale and the federal outcome is
subject to question, is certainly at odds with the provision in paragraph four
that the one year starts running when the operative fact ""could have been
discovered through the exercise of due diligence."" And by maximizing the time
that judgments are open to question, a rule allowing that kind of delay would
thwart one of AEDPA's principal purposes,  [*308]   Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S.,
at 179, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251, 121 S. Ct. 2120;  Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U.S. 202,
206, 155 L. Ed. 2d 363, 123 S. Ct. 1398 (2003), a purpose that was also central
to our decisions in Custis and Daniels, see  supra, at 303-304, 161 L. Ed. 2d,
at 552-553.

[***LEdHR1A] [1C] We think neither anomaly is serious enough, however, to
justify rejecting Johnson's basic argument that notice of the order vacating the
predicate conviction is the event that starts the one year running.  Our job
here is to find a sensible way to apply paragraph four when the truth is that
with Daniels not yet on the books AEDPA's drafters probably never thought about
the situation we face here.  Of course it is peculiar to speak of ""discovering""
the fact of the very eventuality the petitioner himself has brought about, but
when that fact is necessary to the § 2255 claim, and treating notice of it as
the trigger produces a more reasonable scheme than the alternatives, the scheme
should be reconciled with the statutory language if it can be.  And here the fit
is painless,  if short on style.

While it sounds odd to speak of discovering a fact one has generated, a
petitioner does not generate the fact of vacatur all by himself.  He does, after
all, have to learn of the court's response in the state proceeding, and
receiving notice of success can surely qualify as a kind of discovery falling
within the statutory language.

That leaves us with the question of how to implement the statutory mandate that
a petitioner act with due diligence in discovering the crucial fact of the
vacatur order that he himself seeks.  The answer is that  [HN6] diligence can be
shown by prompt action on the part of the petitioner as soon as he is in a
position to realize that he has an interest in challenging the prior conviction
[**1581]  with its potential to enhance the later sentence. The important thing
is to identify a particular time when the course of the later federal
prosecution clearly shows that diligence is in order.  That might be the date
the federal indictment is disclosed, the date of judgment, or the date of
finality after  [***556]  direct appeal.  Picking the first date would require
the quickest response and serve finality best,  [*309]  but it would produce
some collateral litigation that federal acquittals would prove to have been
needless, and it shares the same disconnection from the existence of a § 2255
claim as the Government's view of the relevant ""facts,"" see  supra, at 305-306,
161 L. Ed. 2d, at 553-554.  If we picked the third date, collateral litigation
would be minimized, but finality would come late.  This shapes up as a case for
choosing the bowl of porridge between the one too hot and the one too cold, and
settling on the date of judgment as the moment to activate due diligence seems
best to reflect the statutory text and its underlying concerns.  After the entry
of judgment, the subject of the § 2255 claim has come into being, the
significance of inaction is clear, and very little litigation would be wasted,
since most challenged federal convictions are in fact sustained.

[***LEdHR4] [4] The dissent, like Johnson, would dispense with any due diligence
requirement in seeking the state vacatur order itself, on the ground that the
States can impose their own limitation periods on state collateral attacks, as
most States do,  post, at 316, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 560 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).
But the United States has an interest in the finality of sentences imposed by
its own courts;  [HN7] § 2255 is, after all, concerned directly with federal
cases.  As to those federal cases, due diligence is not a ""requirement of [our]
own design,""  post, at 312, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 558, but an explicit demand in the
text of § 2255, P6(4), one that reflects AEDPA's core purposes,  supra, at
307-308, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 555.  The requirement of due diligence must therefore
demand something more than the dissent's willingness to accept no diligence at
all, if the predicate conviction occurred in a State that itself imposes no
limit of time for collaterally attacking its convictions. 7

7 Certainly, as the dissent notes,  post, at 318-319, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 562,
""due diligence"" is an inexact measure of how much delay is too much.  But the
imprecision here is no greater than elsewhere in the law when diligence must be
shown, and the statute's use of an imprecise standard is no justification for
depriving the statutory language of any meaning independent of corresponding
state law, as the dissent would have us do.  Post, at 319, 161 L. Ed. 2d at 562.

 [*310]   [***LEdHR5] [5] The dissent suggests that due diligence is satisfied
by prompt discovery of the existence of the order vacating the state conviction.
Post, at 314, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 559-560.  Where one ""discovers"" a fact that one
has helped to generate, however,  supra, at 308-309, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 555,
whether it be the result of a court proceeding or of some other process begun at
the petitioner's behest, it does not strain logic to treat required diligence in
the ""discovery"" of that fact as entailing diligence in the steps necessary for
the existence of that fact.  To see why this is so, one need only consider a
more commonplace use of the paragraph four limitation rule.  When a petitioner
bases his § 2255 claim on the result of a DNA test, it is the result of the test
that is the ""fac[t] supporting the claim"" in the § 2255 motion, and the 1-year
limitation period therefore begins to run from the date the test result is
""discovered."" Yet unless it is to be read out of the statute, the due diligence
requirement would say that the test result only triggers a new 1-year period if
the petitioner began the  [***557]  testing process with reasonable promptness
once the DNA sample and testing technology were available.  Under the dissent's
view, however, the petitioner could wait untold years (perhaps until the death
of a key prosecution witness) before [**1582]  calling for the DNA test,  yet
once he ""discovered"" the result of that test, he would get the benefit of a
rejuvenated 1-year period regardless of his lengthy delay.  Such a result simply
cannot be squared with the statute's plain text and purpose.

[***LEdHR2A] [2B]  [***LEdHR6A] [6A] We accordingly apply the fourth paragraph
in the situation before us by holding that from November 29, 1994, the date the
District Court entered judgment in his federal case, Johnson was obliged to act
diligently to obtain the state-court order vacating his predicate conviction.
Had he done so, the 1-year limitation period would have run from the date he
received notice of that vacatur. 8

8  [***LEdHR6A] [6B] Once a petitioner diligently has initiated state-court
proceedings, any delay in those proceedings that is not attributable to the
petitioner will not impair the availability of the paragraph four limitation
rule, once those proceedings finally conclude.  We further recognize that th"

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]  These consolidated cases raise questions concerning
the coverage of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), as amended by the
Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, with respect to activities of employees who must
don protective clothing on the employer's premises before they engage in the
productive labor for which they are primarily hired.  The principal question,
which is presented in both cases, is whether the time employees spend walking
between the changing area and the production area is compensable under the FLSA.
The second question, which is presented only in No. 04-66, is whether the time
employees spend waiting to put on the protective gear is compensable under the
statute.  In No. 03-1238, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit answered
""yes"" to the first question,  339 F.3d 894 (2003); in No. 04-66, the Court of
Appeals for the First Circuit answered ""no"" to both questions,  360 F.3d 274,
281 (2004).  We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.   543 U.S. 1144, 125
S. Ct. 1292, 161 L. Ed. 2d 104 (2005).

[*25]  I

As enacted in 1938, the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq., required employers
engaged in the production of goods for commerce to pay their employees a minimum
wage of ""not less than 25 cents an hour,"" § 6(a)(1), 52 Stat. 1062, and
prohibited the employment of any person for workweeks  [***295]  in excess of 40
hours after the second year following the legislation ""unless such employee
receives compensation for his employment in excess of [40] hours . . . at a rate
not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed,""
id., § 7(a)(3), at 1063.  Neither ""work"" nor ""workweek"" is defined in the
statute. 1

 [**519]  Our early cases defined those terms broadly.  In  Tennessee Coal, Iron
& R. Co. v. Muscoda Local No. 123, 321 U.S. 590, 64 S. Ct. 698, 88 L. Ed. 949
(1944), we held that time spent traveling from iron ore mine portals to
underground working areas was compensable; relying on the remedial purposes of
the statute and Webster's Dictionary, we described ""work or employment"" as
""physical or mental exertion (whether burdensome or not) controlled or required
by the employer and pursued necessarily and primarily for the benefit of the
employer and his business.""  Id., at 598, 64 S. Ct. 698, 88 L.Ed. 949; see  id.,
at 598, n. 11, 64 S. Ct. 698, 88 L. Ed. 949.  The same year, in  Armour & Co. v.
Wantock, 323 U.S. 126, 65 S. Ct. 165, 89 L. Ed. 118 (1944), we clarified that
""exertion"" was not in fact necessary for an activity to constitute ""work"" under
the FLSA.  We pointed out that ""an employer, if he chooses, may hire a man to do
nothing, or to do nothing but wait for something to happen.""  Id., at 133, 65 S.
Ct. 165, 89 L. Ed. 118.  Two years later, in  Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery
Co., 328 U.S. 680, 66 S. Ct. 1187, 90 L. Ed. 1515 (1946), we defined ""the
statutory workweek"" to ""includ[e] all time during which an employee is
necessarily required to be on the employer's premises, on duty or at a
prescribed workplace.""  Id., at 690-691, 66 S. Ct. 1187, 90 L. Ed. 1515.
Accordingly,  [*26]  we held that the time necessarily spent by employees
walking from timeclocks near the factory entrance gate to their workstations
must be treated as part of the workweek.  Id., at 691-692, 66 S. Ct. 1187, 90 L.
Ed. 1515.

The year after our decision in Anderson, Congress passed the Portal-to-Portal
Act, amending certain provisions of the FLSA.  Based on findings that judicial
interpretations of the FLSA had superseded ""long-established customs, practices,
and contracts between employers and employees, thereby creating wholly
unexpected liabilities, immense in amount and retroactive in operation,"" 61
Stat. 84, it responded with two statutory remedies, the first relating to
""existing claims,"" id., at 85-86, and the second to ""future claims,"" id., at
87-88.  Both remedies distinguish between working time that is compensable
pursuant to contract or custom and practice, on the one hand, and time that was
found compensable under this Court's expansive reading of the FLSA, on the
other.  Like the original FLSA, however, the Portal-to-Portal Act omits any
definition of the term ""work.""

[*27]  With respect to existing claims, the Portal-to-Portal Act provided that
employers would not incur liability on account of their failure to pay minimum
wages or overtime compensation for any activity that was not compensable by
either an express contract or an established  [***296]  custom or practice. 2
[**520]  With respect to ""future claims,"" the Act preserved potential liability
for working time not made compensable by contract or custom but narrowed the
coverage of the FLSA by excepting two activities that had been treated as
compensable under our cases: walking on the employer's premises to and from the
actual place of performance of the principal activity of the employee, and
activities that are ""preliminary or postliminary"" to that principal activity.

     ""(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) [which covers work

Other than its express exceptions for travel to and from the location of the
employee's ""principal activity,"" and for activities that are preliminary or
postliminary to that principal activity, the Portal-to-Portal Act does not
purport to change this Court's earlier descriptions of the terms ""work"" and
""workweek,"" or to define the term ""workday."" A regulation promulgated by the
Secretary of Labor shortly after its enactment concluded that the statute had no
effect on the computation  [***297]  of hours that are worked ""within"" the
workday. That regulation states:  [HN3] ""[T]o the extent that activities engaged
in by an employee occur after the employee commences to perform the first
principal activity on a particular workday and before he ceases the performance
of the last principal activity on a particular workday, the provisions of [§ 4]
have no application."" 29 CFR § 790.6(a) (2005). 3 Similarly,  [*29]   [**521]
consistent with our prior decisions interpreting the FLSA, the Department of
Labor has adopted the continuous workday rule, which means that  [HN4] the
""workday"" is generally defined as ""the period between the commencement and
completion on the same workday of an employee's principal activity or
activities.""  § 790.6(b).  These regulations have remained in effect since 1947,
see  12 Fed. Reg. 7658 (1947), and no party disputes the validity of the
continuous workday rule.

whistle,' and its provisions have nothing to do with the compensability under
the Fair Labor Standards Act of any activities engaged in by an employee during
that period.  Under the provisions of section 4, one of the conditions that must
be present before 'preliminary' or 'postliminary' activities are excluded from
hours worked is that they 'occur either prior to the time on any particular
workday at which the employee commences, or subsequent to the time on any
particular workday at which he ceases' the principal activity or activities
which he is employed to perform.  Accordingly, to the extent that activities
engaged in by an employee occur after the employee commences to perform the
first principal activity on a particular workday and before he ceases the
performance of the last principal activity on a particular workday, the
provisions of that section have no application.  Periods of time between the
commencement of the employee's first principal activity and the completion of
his last principal activity on any workday must be included in the computation
of hours worked to the same extent as would be required if the Portal Act had
not been enacted.  The principles for determining hours worked within the
'workday' proper will continue to be those established under the Fair Labor
Standards Act without reference to the Portal Act, which is concerned with this
question only as it relates to time spent outside the 'workday' in activities of
the kind described in section 4."" § 790.6(a) (footnotes omitted).

 In 1955, eight years after the enactment of the Portal-to-Portal Act and the
promulgation of these interpretive regulations, we were confronted with the
question whether workers in a battery plant had a statutory right to
compensation for the ""time incident to changing clothes at the beginning of the
shift and showering at the end, where they must make extensive use of
dangerously caustic and toxic materials, and are compelled by circumstances,
including vital considerations of health and hygiene, to change clothes and to
shower in facilities which state law requires their employers to provide. . . .""
Steiner v. Mitchell, 350 U.S. 247, 248, 76 S. Ct. 330, 100 L. Ed. 267 (1956).
After distinguishing ""changing clothes and showering under normal conditions""
and stressing the important health and safety risks associated with the
production of batteries,  id., at 249, 76 S. Ct. 330, 100 L. Ed. 267, the Court
endorsed the Court of Appeals' conclusion that these activities were compensable
under the FLSA.

In reaching this result, we specifically agreed with the Court of Appeals that
""the term 'principal activity or activities' in Section 4 [of the
Portal-to-Portal Act] embraces all activities which are an 'integral and
indispensable part of  [*30]  the principal activities,' and that the activities
in question fall within this category.""  Id., at 252-253, 76 S. Ct. 330, 100 L.
[***298]  Ed. 267.  Thus, under Steiner, activities, such as the donning and
doffing of specialized protective gear, that are ""performed either before or
after the regular work shift, on or off the production line, are compensable
under the portal-to-portal provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act if those
activities are an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities
for which covered workmen are employed and are not specifically excluded by
Section 4(a)(1).""  Id., at 256, 76 S. Ct. 330, 100 L. Ed. 267.

[***LEdHR1A]  The principal question presented by these consolidated cases--both
of which involve required protective gear that the courts below found integral
and indispensable to the employees' work--is whether postdonning and predoffing
walking time is specifically excluded by § 4(a)(1).  We conclude that it is not.

Petitioner in No. 03-1238, IBP, Inc. (IBP), is a large producer of fresh beef,
pork, and related products.  At its plant in Pasco, Washington, it employs
approximately 178 workers in 113 job classifications in the slaughter division
and 800 line workers in 145 job classifications in the processing division.  All
production workers in both divisions must wear outer garments, hardhats,
hairnets, earplugs, gloves, sleeves, aprons, leggings, and boots.  Many of them,
particularly those who use knives, must also wear a variety of protective
equipment for their hands,  [**522]  arms, torsos, and legs; this gear includes
chain link metal aprons, vests, plexiglass armguards, and special gloves.  IBP
requires its employees to store their equipment and tools in company locker
rooms, where most of them don their protective gear.

Production workers' pay is based on the time spent cutting and bagging meat.
Pay begins with the first piece of meat and ends with the last piece of meat.
Since 1998, however,  [*31]  IBP has also paid for four minutes of
clothes-changing time. 4 In 1999, respondents, IBP employees, filed this class
action to recover compensation for preproduction and postproduction work,
including the time spent donning and doffing protective gear and walking between
the locker rooms and the production floor before and after their assigned
shifts.

 After a lengthy bench trial, the District Court for the Eastern District of
Washington held that donning and doffing of protective gear that was unique to
the jobs at issue were compensable under the FLSA because they were integral and
indispensable to the work of the employees who wore such equipment.  Moreover,
consistent with the continuous workday rule, the District Court concluded that,
for those employees required to don and doff unique protective gear, the walking
time between the locker room and the production floor was also compensable
because it occurs during the workday. 5 The court did not, however, allow
[***299]  any recovery for ordinary clothes changing and washing, or for the
""donning and doffing of hard hat[s], ear plugs, safety glasses, boots [or]
hairnet[s]."" App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 03-1238, p 65a.

5 The District Court explained:

""Walking time is compensable if it occurs after the start of the workday. 29
U.S.C. § 254(a).  Walking time is excluded under the Portal to Portal Act only
if it occurs 'either prior to the time on any particular work day at which such
employee commences or subsequent to the time on any particular work day at which
he ceases such principal activity or activities.' Id. The work day begins with
the commencement of an employee's principal activity or activities and ends with
the completion of the employee's activity. . . ."" App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.

 The District Court proceeded to apply these legal conclusions in making
detailed factual findings with regard to the different groups of employees.  For
example, the District  [*32]  Court found that, under its view of what was
covered by the FLSA, processing division knife users were entitled to
compensation for between 12 and 14 minutes of preproduction and postproduction
work, including 3.3 to 4.4 minutes of walking time.

The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court's ultimate conclusions on
these issues, but in part for different reasons.   339 F.3d 894 (CA9 2003).
After noting that the question whether activities ""'are an integral and
indispensable part of the principal activities'"" within the meaning of Steiner
is ""context specific,""  339 F.3d at 902, the Court of Appeals endorsed the
distinction between the burdensome donning and doffing of elaborate protective
gear, on the one hand, and the time spent donning and doffing nonunique gear
such as hardhats and safety goggles, on the other.  It did so not because
donning and doffing nonunique gear are categorically excluded from being
""principal activities"" as defined by the Portal-to-Portal Act, but rather
because, in the context of this case, the time employees spent donning and
doffing nonunique protective gear [**523]  was ""'de minimis as a matter of
law.'""  Id., at 904.

[***LEdHR3] [3] IBP does not challenge the holding below that, in light of
Steiner, the donning and doffing of unique protective gear are ""principal
activities"" under § 4 of the Portal-to-Portal Act.  Moreover, IBP has not asked
us to overrule Steiner.  [HN5] Considerations of stare decisis are particularly
forceful in the area of statutory construction, especially when a unanimous
interpretation of a statute has been accepted as settled law for several
decades.  Thus, the only question for us to decide is whether the Court of
Appeals correctly rejected IBP's contention that the walking between the locker
rooms and the production areas is excluded from FLSA coverage by § 4(a)(1) of
the Portal-to-Portal Act.

[***LEdHR1A]  IBP argues that the text of § 4(a)(1), the history and purpose of
its enactment, and the Department of Labor's interpretive guidance compel the
conclusion that the Portal-to-Portal  [*33]  Act excludes this walking time from
the scope of the FLSA.  We find each of these arguments unpersuasive.

Text

IBP correctly points out that our decision in Steiner held only that the donning
and doffing of protective gear in that case were activities ""integral and
indispensable"" to the workers' principal activity of making batteries.   350
U.S., at 256, 76 S. Ct. 330, 100 L. Ed. 267.  In IBP's view, a category of
""integral and indispensable"" activities that may be compensable because they are
not merely preliminary or postliminary within the meaning of § 4(a)(2) is not
necessarily coextensive with the actual  [***300]  ""principal activities"" which
the employee ""is employed to perform"" within the meaning of § 4(a)(1).  In other
words, IBP argues that, even though the court below concluded that donning and
doffing of unique protective gear are ""integral and indispensable"" to the
employees' principal activity, this means only that the donning and doffing of
such gear are themselves covered by the FLSA.  According to IBP, the donning is
not a ""principal activity"" that starts the workday, and the walking that occurs
immediately after donning and immediately before doffing is not compensable. In
effect, IBP asks us to create a third category of activities--those that are
""integral and indispensable"" to a ""principal activity"" and thus not excluded
from coverage by § 4(a)(2), but that are not themselves ""principal activities""
as that term is defined by § 4(a)(1).

[***LEdHR4A]   [***LEdHR5] [5]  [***LEdHR6] [6] IBP's submission is foreclosed
by Steiner As noted above, in Steiner we made it clear that  [HN6] § 4 of the
Portal-to-Portal Act does not remove activities which are ""'integral and
indispensable'"" to ""'principal activities'"" from FLSA coverage precisely because
such activities are themselves ""principal activities.""  Id., at 253, 76 S. Ct.
330, 110 L. Ed. 267.  While Steiner specifically addressed the proper
interpretation of the term ""principal activity or activities"" in § 4(a)(2),
there is no plausible argument that these terms mean something different in
[*34]  § 4(a)(2) than they do in § 4(a)(1). 6 This is not only because of  [HN7]
the normal rule of statutory interpretation that identical words used in
different parts of the same statute are generally presumed to have the same
meaning.  E.g.,  Sullivan v. Stroop, 496 U.S. 478, 484, 110 S. Ct. 2499, 110 L.
Ed. 2d 438 (1990).  It is also because § 4(a)(2) refers to ""said principal
activity [**524]  or activities."" 61 Stat. 87 (emphasis added).  The ""said"" is
an explicit reference to the use of the identical term in § 4(a)(1).

6 In fact, as noted above, in Steiner we specifically endorsed the view of the
Court of Appeals that the definition of ""principal activity or activities"" in §
4 encompassed activities ""'integral and indispensable'"" to those principal
activities.  We did not make any distinction between § 4(a)(1) and § 4(a)(2).

  [***LEdHR1A]  Indeed, IBP has not offered any support for the unlikely
proposition that Congress intended to create an intermediate category of
activities that would be sufficiently ""principal"" to be compensable, but not
sufficiently principal to commence the workday. Accepting the necessary import
of our holding in Steiner, we conclude that the locker rooms where the special
safety gear is donned and doffed are the relevant ""place of performance"" of the
principal activity that the employee was employed to perform within the meaning
of § 4(a)(1).  Walking to that place before starting work is excluded from FLSA
coverage, but the statutory text does not exclude walking from that place to
another area within the plant immediately after the workday has commenced.

Purpose

IBP emphasizes that our decision in  Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., 328
U.S. 680, 66 S. Ct. 1187, 90 L. Ed. 1515, may well have been the proximate cause
of the enactment of the Portal-to-Portal Act. In that case we held that the FLSA
mandated compensation for the time that employees spent walking from time clocks
located near the plant entrance  [***301]  to their respective places of work
prior to the start of their productive labor.   Id., at 690-691, 66 S. Ct. 1187,
90 L. Ed. 1515.  In IBP's view, Congress' forceful repudiation  [*35]  of that
holding reflects a purpose to exclude what IBP regards as the quite similar
walking time spent by respondents before and after their work slaughtering
cattle and processing meat.  Even if there is ambiguity in the statute, we
should construe it to effectuate that important purpose.

This argument is also unpersuasive.  There is a critical difference between the
walking at issue in Anderson and the walking at issue in this case.  In Anderson
the walking preceded the employees' principal activity; it occurred before the
workday began.  The relevant walking in this case occurs after the workday
begins and before it ends.  Only if we were to endorse IBP's novel submission
that an activity can be sufficiently ""principal"" to be compensable, but not
sufficiently so to start the workday, would this case be comparable to Anderson.

Moreover, there is a significant difference between the open-ended and
potentially expansive liability that might result from a rule that treated
travel before the workday begins as compensable, and the rule at issue in this
case.  Indeed, for processing division knife users, the largest segment of the
work force at IBP's plant, the walking time in dispute here consumes less time
than the donning and doffing activities that precede or follow it.  It is more
comparable to time spent walking between two different positions on an assembly
line than to the prework walking in Anderson.

Regulations

The regulations adopted by the Secretary of Labor in 1947 support respondents'
view that when donning and doffing of protective gear are compensable
activities, they may also define the outer limits of the workday. Under those
regulations, the few minutes spent walking between the locker rooms and the
production area are similar to the time spent walking between two different
workplaces on the disassembly line.  See 29 CFR § 790.7(c) (2005) (explaining
that  [HN8] the Portal-to-Portal Act does not affect the compensability of
[*36]  time spent traveling from the place of performance of one principal
activity to that of another).  See also § 785.38 (explaining, in a later
regulation interpreting the FLSA, that  [HN9] ""[w]here an employee is required
to report at a meeting place to  [**525]  receive instructionsor to perform
other work there, or to pick up and to carry tools, the travel from the
designated place to the work place is part of the day's work, and must be
counted as hours worked . . ."").

IBP argues, however, that two provisions in the regulations point to a different
conclusion--the use of the phrase ""whistle to whistle"" in discussing the limits
of the ""workday,"" § 790.6, and a footnote stating that postchanging walking time
is not ""necessarily"" excluded from the scope of § 4(a)(1),  § 790.7(g) n 49.

The ""whistle to whistle"" reference does reflect the view that in most situations
the workday will be defined by the beginning and ending of the primary
productive activity.  But the relevant text describes the workday as ""roughly
the period 'from whistle to whistle.'"" § 790.6(a) (emphasis added).  Indeed, the
next subsection  [***302]  of this same regulation states:  [HN10] ""'Workday' as
used in the Portal Act means, in general, the period between the commencement
and completion on the same workday of an employee's principal activity or
activities."" § 790.6(b).  IBP's emphasis on the ""whistle to whistle"" reference
is unavailing.

The footnote on which IBP relies states:


      [HN11] ""Washing up after work, like the changing of clothes, may in
     certain situations be so directly related to the specific work the
     employee is employed to perform that it would be regarded as an
     integral part of the employee's 'principal activity.' This does not
     necessarily mean, however, that travel between the washroom or
     clothes-changing place and the actual place of performance of the
     specific work the employee is employed to perform, would be excluded
     from the type of travel to  [*37]  which section 4(a) refers."" §
     790.7(g), n 49 (emphasis added; citations omitted).



This footnote does indicate that the Secretary assumed that there would be some
cases in which walking between a locker room where the employee performs her
first principal activity and the production line would be covered by the FLSA
and some cases in which it would not be.  That assumption is, of course,
inconsistent with IBP's submission that such walking is always excluded by §
4(a), just as it is inconsistent with respondents' view that such walking is
never excluded.  Whatever the correct explanation for the Secretary's ambiguous
(and apparently ambivalent) statement may be, it is not sufficient to overcome
the clear statements in the text of the regulations that support our holding.
And it surely is not sufficient to overcome the statute itself, whose meaning is
definitively resolved by Steiner.

[***LEdHR4A]   [***LEdHR7] [7] For the foregoing reasons, we hold that  [HN12]
any activity that is ""integral and indispensable"" to a ""principal activity"" is
itself a ""principal activity"" under § 4(a) of the Portal-to-Portal Act.
Moreover,  [HN13] during a continuous workday, any walking time that occurs
after the beginning of the employee's first principal activity and before the
end of the employee's last principal activity is excluded from the scope of that
provision, and as a result is covered by the FLSA.

Respondent in No. 04-66, Barber Foods, Inc. (Barber), operates a poultry
processing plant in Portland, Maine, that employs about 300 production workers.
These employees operate six production lines and perform a variety of tasks that
require different combinations of protective clothing.  They are paid by the
hour from the time they punch in to computerized timeclocks located at the
entrances to the production floor.

[**526]  Petitioners are Barber employees and former employees w"
"                UNITED STATES, Petitioner v. JOSEPH OLSON, et al.",546 U.S. 43,"

 [*44]   [**511]  Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.

[HN1]  [***LEdHR1A] [1A]  [***LEdHR2] [2] The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA or
Act) authorizes private tort actions against the United States ""under
circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to
the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission
occurred."" 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(1).  We here interpret these words to mean what
they say, namely, that  [HN2] the United States waives sovereign immunity ""under
circumstances"" where local law would make a ""private person"" liable in tort.
(Emphasis added.) And we reverse [**512]  a line of Ninth Circuit precedent
permitting courts in certain circumstances to base a waiver simply upon a
finding that local law would make a ""state or municipal entit[y]"" liable.  See,
e.g.,  Hines v. United States, 60 F.3d 1442, 1448 (1995);  Cimo v. INS, 16 F.3d
1039, 1041 (1994);  Cameron v. Janssen Bros. Nurseries, Ltd., 7 F.3d 821, 825
[*45]  (1993);  Aguilar v. United States, 920 F.2d 1475, 1477 (1990);  Doggett
v. United States, 875 F.2d 684, 689 (1989).

I

[***LEdHR1A] [1B]  [***LEdHR3A] [3A] In this case, two injured mine workers (and
a spouse) have sued the United States claiming that the negligence of federal
mine inspectors helped bring about a serious accident at an Arizona mine.  The
Federal District Court dismissed the lawsuit in part upon the ground that their
allegations were insufficient to show that Arizona law would impose liability
upon a private person in similar circumstances.  The Ninth Circuit, in a brief
per curiam opinion, reversed this determination.  It reasoned from two premises.
First, where ""'unique governmental functions'"" are at issue, the Act waives
sovereign immunity if ""'a state or municipal entity would be [subject to
liability] under the law [. . .] where the activity occurred.'""  362 F.3d 1236,
1240 (2004) (citing  Hines, supra, at 1448, and quoting  Doggett, supra, at 689,
and  Concrete Tie of San Diego, Inc. v. Liberty Constr., Inc., 107 F.3d 1368,
1371 (CA9 1997)) .  Second, federal mine inspections being regulatory in nature
are such ""'unique governmental functions,'"" since ""there is no private-sector
analogue for mine inspections.""  362 F.3d at 1240 (quoting in  [***311]  part
Doggett, supra, at 689).  The Circuit then held that Arizona law would make
""state and municipal entities"" liable in the circumstances alleged; hence the
FTCA waives the United States' sovereign immunity.  362 F.3d at 1240.

II

[***LEdHR1A] [1C]  [***LEdHR3A] [3B] We disagree with both of the Ninth
Circuit's legal premises.

A

The first premise is too broad, for it reads into the Act something that is not
there.  The Act says that it waives sovereign immunity ""under circumstances
where the United States, if a private person,"" not ""the United States, if a
state  [*46]  or municipal entity,"" would be liable.  28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(1)
(emphasis added).  Our cases have consistently adhered to this ""private person""
standard.  In  Indian Towing Co. v. United States, 350 U.S. 61, 64, 76 S. Ct.
122, 100 L. Ed. 48 (1955), this Court rejected the Government's contention that
there was ""no liability for negligent performance of 'uniquely governmental
functions.'"" It held that  [HN3] the Act requires a court to look to the
state-law liability of private entities, not to that of public entities, when
assessing the Government's liability under the FTCA ""in the performance of
activities which private persons do not perform."" Ibid. In  Rayonier Inc. v.
United States, 352 U.S. 315, 318-319, 77 S. Ct. 374, 1 L. Ed. 2d 354 (1957), the
Court rejected a claim that the scope of FTCA liability for ""'uniquely
governmental'"" functions depends on whether state law ""imposes liability on
municipal or other local governments for the negligence of their agents acting
in"" similar circumstances.  And even though both these cases involved Government
efforts to escape liability by pointing to the absence of municipal entity
liability, we are unaware of any reason for treating differently a plaintiff's
effort to base liability solely upon the fact that a State would impose
liability upon a municipal (or other state governmental) entity. Indeed, we have
found nothing in the Act's context, history, or objectives or in the opinions of
[**513]  this Court suggesting a waiver of sovereign immunity solely upon that
basis.

B

[***LEdHR3A] [3C] The Ninth Circuit's second premise rests upon a reading of the
Act that is too narrow.   [HN4] The Act makes the United States liable ""in the
same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like
circumstances."" 28 U.S.C. § 2674 (emphasis added).  As this Court said in Indian
Towing, the words ""'like circumstances'"" do not restrict a court's inquiry to
the same circumstances, but require it to look further afield.  350 U.S., at 64,
76 S. Ct. 122, 100 L. Ed. 48; see also S. Rep. No. 1400, 79th Cong., 2d Sess.,
32 (1946) (purpose of FTCA was to  [*47]  make the tort liability of the United
States ""the same as that of a private person under like circumstance, in
accordance with the local law"").  The Court there considered a claim that the
Coast Guard, responsible for operating a lighthouse, had failed ""to check"" the
light's ""battery and sun relay system,"" had failed ""to make a proper
examination"" of outside ""connections,"" had ""fail[ed] to check the light"" on a
regular basis, and had failed to ""repair the light or give warning that the
light was not operating.""  Indian Towing, 350 U.S., at 62, 76 S. Ct. 122, 100 L.
Ed. 48.   [***312]  These allegations, the Court held, were analogous to
allegations of negligence by a private person ""who undertakes to warn the public
of danger and thereby induces reliance.""  Id., at 64-65, 76 S. Ct. 122, 100
L.Ed. 48.  It is ""hornbook tort law,"" the Court added, that such a person ""must
perform his 'good Samaritan' task in a careful manner."" Ibid.

The Government in effect concedes that similar ""good Samaritan"" analogies exist
for the conduct at issue here.  It says that ""there are private persons in 'like
circumstances'"" to federal mine inspectors, namely, ""private persons who conduct
safety inspections."" Reply Brief for United States 3.  And other Courts of
Appeals have found ready private person analogies for Government tasks of this
kind in FTCA cases.  E.g.,  Dorking Genetics v. United States, 76 F.3d 1261 (CA2
1996) (inspection of cattle);  Florida Auto Auction of Orlando, Inc. v. United
States, 74 F.3d 498 (CA4 1996) (inspection of automobile titles);  Ayala v.
United States, 49 F.3d 607 (CA10 1995) (mine inspections);  Myers v. United
States, 17 F.3d 890 (CA6 1994) (same);  Howell v. United States, 932 F.2d 915
(CA11 1991) (inspection of airplanes).  These cases all properly apply the logic
of Indian Towing. Private individuals, who do not operate lighthouses,
nonetheless may create a relationship with third parties that is similar to the
relationship between a lighthouse operator and a ship dependent on the
lighthouse's beacon.   Indian Towing, supra, at 64-65, 69, 76 S. Ct. 122, 100 L.
Ed. 48.  The Ninth Circuit should have looked for a similar analogy in this
case.

[*48]  III

[***LEdHR4] [4] Despite the Government's concession that a private person
analogy exists in this case, the parties disagree about precisely which Arizona
tort law doctrine applies here.  We remand the case so that the lower courts can
decide this matter in the first instance. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is
vacated, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

 [**680]   [*99]  Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A]  [***LEdHR2] [2] The State of Kansas imposes a tax on the
receipt of motor fuel by fuel distributors within its boundaries.  Kansas
applies that tax to motor fuel received by non-Indian fuel distributors who
subsequently deliver that fuel to a gas station owned by, and located on, the
Reservation of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation (Nation).  The Nation
maintains that this application of the Kansas motor fuel tax is an impermissible
affront to its sovereignty. The Court of Appeals agreed, holding that the
application of the Kansas tax to fuel received by a non-Indian distributor, but
subsequently delivered to the Nation, was invalid under the interest-balancing
test set forth in  White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U.S. 136, 100 S.
Ct. 2578, 65 L. Ed. 2d 665 (1980).  But the Bracker interest-balancing test
applies only where ""a State asserts authority over the conduct of non-Indians
engaging in activity on the reservation.""  Id., at 144, 100 S. Ct. 2578, 65 L.
Ed. 2d 665.  It does not apply where, as here, a state tax is imposed on a
non-Indian and arises as a result of a transaction that occurs off the
reservation. Accordingly, we reverse.

The Nation is a federally recognized Indian Tribe whose reservation is on United
States trust land in Jackson County, Kansas.  The Nation owns and operates a
casino on its reservation. In order to accommodate casino patrons and other
reservation-related traffic, the Nation constructed, and now owns and operates,
a gas station on its reservation next to the casino. Seventy-three  [***436]
percent of the station's fuel sales are made to casino patrons, while 11 percent
of the station's fuel sales are made to persons who live or work on the
reservation. The Nation purchases fuel for its gas station from non-Indian
distributors located off its reservation. Those distributors pay a state fuel
tax on their initial receipt of [*100]  motor fuel, Kan. Stat. Ann. § 79-3408
(2003 Cum. Supp.), 1 and pass along the cost of that tax to their customers,
including the Nation. 2

cost of the tax to the Nation's gas station. At oral argument, petitioner

was in fact passing along the cost of the tax to the Nation.

 The Nation sells its fuel within 2 cents per gallon of the prevailing market
price.   Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation v. Richards, 379 F.3d 979, 982 (CA10
2004).  It does so notwithstanding the distributor's decision to pass along the
cost of the State's fuel tax to the Nation, and the Nation's decision to impose
its own tax on the station's fuel sales in the amount of 16 cents per gallon of
gasoline and 18 cents per gallon of diesel (increased to 20 cents for gasoline
and 22 cents for diesel in January 2003).   Ibid.  The Nation's [**681]  fuel
tax generates approximately $300,000 annually, funds that the Nation uses for
""'constructing and maintaining roads, bridges and rights-of-way located on or
near the Reservation,'"" including the access road between the state-funded
highway and the casino. Ibid.

The Nation brought an action in Federal District Court for declaratory judgment
and injunctive relief from the State's collection of motor fuel tax from
distributors who deliver fuel to the reservation. The District Court granted
summary judgment in favor of the State.  Applying the Bracker interest-balancing
test, it determined that the balance of state, federal, and tribal interests
tilted in favor of the State.  The court reached this determination because ""it
is undisputed that the legal incidence of the tax is directed off-reservation at
the fuel distributors,""  Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation v. Richards, 241 F.
Supp. 2d 1295, 1311 (Kan.  [*101]  2003), and because the ultimate purchasers of
the fuel, non-Indian casino patrons, receive the bulk of their governmental
services from the State,  id., at 1309.  The court held that the State's tax did
not interfere with the Nation's right of self-government, adding that ""a tribe
cannot oust a state from any power to tax on-reservation purchases by nonmembers
of the tribe by simply imposing its own tax on the transactions or by otherwise
earning its revenues from the tribal business.""  Id., at 1311.

The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed.   379 F.3d 979 (2004).  It
determined that, under Bracker, the balance of state, federal, and tribal
interests favored the Tribe. The Tenth Circuit reasoned that the Nation's fuel
revenues were ""derived from value generated primarily on its reservation,""  379
F.3d, at 984 --namely, the creation of a new fuel market by virtue of the
presence  [***437]  of the casino--and that the Nation's interests in taxing
this reservation-created value to raise revenue for reservation infrastructure
outweighed the State's ""general interest in raising revenues,""  id., at 986.  We
granted certiorari,  543 U.S. 1186, 543 U.S. 1186, 125 S. Ct. 1397, 161 L. Ed.
2d 189 (2005), and now reverse.

Although we granted certiorari to determine whether Kansas may tax a non-Indian
distributor's off-reservation receipt of fuel without being subject to the
Bracker interest-balancing test, Pet. for Cert. i, the Nation maintains that
Kansas'""tax is imposed not on the off-reservation receipt of fuel, but on its
on-reservation sale and delivery,"" Brief for Respondent 11 (emphasis in
original).  As the Nation recognizes,  [HN1] under our Indian tax immunity
cases, the ""who"" and the ""where"" of the challenged tax have significant
consequences.  We have determined that ""[t]he initial and frequently dispositive
question in Indian tax cases . . . is who bears the legal incidence of [the]
tax,""  Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Chickasaw Nation, 515 U.S. 450, 458, 115 S. Ct.
2214, 132 L. Ed. 2d 400 (1995) (emphasis added), and that the States are
categorically barred [*102]  from placing the legal incidence of an excise tax ""
on a tribe or on tribal members for sales made inside Indian country"" without
congressional authorization,  id., at 459, 115 S. Ct. 2214, 132 L. Ed. 2d 400
(emphasis added).  We have further determined that, even when a State imposes
the legal incidence of its tax on a non-Indian seller, the tax may nonetheless
be pre-empted if the transaction giving rise to tax liability occurs on the
reservation and the imposition of the tax fails to satisfy the Bracker
interest-balancing test.  See  448 U.S. 136, 100 S. Ct. 2578, 65 L. Ed. 2d 665
(holding that state taxes imposed on on-reservation logging and hauling
operations by non-Indian contractor are invalid under the interest-balancing
test); cf.  Central Machinery Co. v. Arizona  [**682]  Tax Comm'n, 448 U.S. 160,
100 S. Ct. 2592, 65 L. Ed. 2d 684 (1980) (holding that the Indian trader
statutes pre-empted Arizona's tax on a non-Indian seller's on-reservation
sales).

The Nation maintains that it is entitled to prevail under the categorical bar
articulated in Chickasaw because ""[t]he fairest reading of the statute is that
the legal incidence of the tax actually falls on the Tribe [on the
reservation]."" Brief for Respondent 17, n 5.  The Nation alternatively maintains
it is entitled to prevail even if the legal incidence of the tax is on the
non-Indian distributor because, according to the Nation, the tax arises out of a
distributor's on-reservation transaction with the Tribe and is therefore subject
to the Bracker balancing test.  Brief for Respondent 15.  We address the ""who""
and the ""where"" of Kansas' motor fuel tax in turn.

A

[***LEdHR1A] [1B]  [***LEdHR3] [3] Kansas law specifies that  [HN2] ""the
incidence of [the motor fuel] tax is imposed on the distributor of the first
receipt of the motor fuel."" Kan. Stat. Ann. § 79-3408(c) (2003 Cum. Supp.).  We
have suggested that such ""dispositive language"" from the state legislature is
determinative of who bears the legal incidence of a state excise tax.
Chickasaw, supra, at 461, 115 S. Ct. 2214, 132 L. Ed. 2d 400.  But even if the
state legislature had not employed such ""dispositive language,""  [***438]
thereby requiring us instead to look  [*103]  to a ""fair interpretation of the
taxing statute as written and applied,""  California Bd. of Equalization v.
Chemehuevi Tribe, 474 U.S. 9, 11, 106 S. Ct. 289, 88 L. Ed. 2d 9 (1985) (per
curiam), we would nonetheless conclude that the legal incidence of the tax is on
the distributor.

[HN3]  [***LEdHR1A] [1C] Kansas law makes clear that it is the distributor,
rather than the retailer, that is liable to pay the motor fuel tax. Section
79-3410(a) (1997) provides, in relevant part, that  [HN4] ""[e]very distributor .
. . shall compute and shall pay to the director . . . the amount of [motor fuel]
taxes due to the state.""  [HN5] While the distributors are ""entitled"" to pass
along the cost of the tax to downstream purchasers, see § 79-3409 (2003 Cum.
Supp.), they are not required to do so.  In sum, the legal incidence of the
Kansas motor fuel tax is on the distributor. The lower courts reached the same
conclusion.   379 F.3d, at 982 (""The Kansas legislature structured the tax so
that its legal incidence is placed on non-Indian distributors"");  241 F. Supp.
2d, at 1311 (""[I]t is undisputed that the legal incidence of the tax is directed
off-reservation at the fuel distributors""); see also  Sac and Fox Nation of
Missouri v. Pierce, 213 F.3d 566, 578 (CA10 2000) (""[T]he legal incidence of the
[Kansas] tax law as presently written falls on the fuel distributors rather than
on the Tribes"");  Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska v. Kline, 297 F. Supp. 2d 1291,
1294 (Kan. 2004) (""Under the Kansas statutory scheme, the legal incidence of the
state's fuel tax falls on the 'distributor of first receipt' of such fuel"");
Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri v. LaFaver, 31 F. Supp. 2d 1298, 1307 (Kan. 1998)
(""[T]he statutes are extremely clear in providing that the tax in question is
imposed upon the distributor"").  And the Kansas Department of Revenue, the state
agency charged with administering the motor fuel tax, has concluded likewise.
See Letter from David J. Heinemann, Office of Administrative Appeals, to Mark A.
Burghart, Written Final Determination in Request for Informal Conference for
Reconsideration of Agency Action, Davies Oil Co., Inc., Docket No. 01-970 (Jan.
3, 2002)  [*104]  (hereinafter Kansas Dept. of Revenue Letter) (""The legal
incidence of the Kansas fuel tax rests with Davies, the distributor, who is
up-stream from Nation, the retailer"").

[**683]  The United States, as amicus, contends that this conclusion is
foreclosed by the Kansas Supreme Court's decision in  Kaul v. State Dep't of
Revenue, 266 Kan. 464, 970 P.2d 60 (1998).  The United States reads Kaul as
holding that the legal incidence of Kansas' motor fuel tax rests on the Indian
retailers, rather than on the non-Indian distributors. And, under the United
States' view, so long as the Kansas Supreme Court's ""'definitive determination
as to the operating incidence'"" of its fuel tax is ""'consistent with the
statute's reasonable interpretation,'"" it should be ""'deemed conclusive.'"" Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae 10 (quoting  Gurley v. Rhoden, 421 U.S. 200,
208, 95 S. Ct. 1605, 44 L. Ed. 2d 110 (1975)).

We disagree with the United States' interpretation of Kaul. In Kaul, two members
of the Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of Oklahoma sought to enjoin the
enforcement of Kansas' fuel tax on fuel delivered to their gas station located
on the Prairie Band Potawatomi Tribe of Kansas'  [***439]  Reservation. The
Kansas Supreme Court determined that the station owners had standing to
challenge the tax because the statute provided that the distributor was entitled
to ""'charge and collect such tax . . . as a part of the selling price.'""  Kaul,
supra, at 474, 970 P.2d, at 67 (quoting Kan. Stat. Ann. § 79-3409 (1995);
emphasis deleted).  The court determined that the station owners were not
entitled to an injunction, however, because they were not members of a Kansas
tribe and thus there had ""been no showing by Retailers that payment of fuel tax
to Kansas interferes with the self-government of a Kansas tribe or a Kansas
tribal member.""  266 Kan., at 477, 970 P.2d, at 69.  The court then noted that
""the legal incidence of the tax on motor fuel rests on nontribal members and
does not affect the Potawatomi Indian reservation within the state of Kansas.""
Ibid.

[*105]  Kaul does not foreclose our determination that the distributor bears the
legal incidence of the Kansas motor fuel tax. As an initial matter, it is
unclear whether the court's reference to ""nontribal members"" is a reference to
the non-tribal-member retailers or the non-tribal-member distributors. At the
very least, Kaul's imprecise language cannot be characterized as a definitive
determination.  Moreover, the 1998 amendments to the Kansas fuel provisions,
including the amendment to § 79-3408(c) that provides that ""the incidence of
this tax is imposed on the distributor,"" were not applied in Kaul.  Id., at 473,
970 P.2d, at 66 (identifying provisions that were repealed in 1998 as being ""in
effect during the period relevant to this case"");  id., at 474, 970 P.2d, at 67
(noting that a ""critical statute"" to its holding was the 1995 version of §
79-3409, which was amended in 1998).  Accordingly, Kaul did not speak
authoritatively on the provisions before us today.

B

The Nation maintains that we must apply the Bracker interest-balancing test,
irrespective of the identity of the taxpayer (i.e., the party bearing the legal
incidence), because the Kansas fuel tax arises as a result of the on-reservation
sale and delivery of the motor fuel. See Brief for Respondent 15.  Notably,
however, the Nation presented a starkly different interpretation of the statute
in the proceedings before the Court of Appeals, arguing that ""[t]he balancing
test is appropriate even though the legal incidence of the tax is imposed on the
Nation's non-Indian distributor and is triggered by the distributor's receipt of
fuel outside the reservation."" Appellant's Reply Brief in No. 03-3218 (CA10), p
3 (emphasis added); see also  241 F. Supp. 2d, at 1311 (District Court observing
that ""it is undisputed that the [**684]  legal incidence of the tax is directed
off-reservation at the fuel distributors"").  A ""fair interpretation of the
taxing statute as written and applied,""  Chemehuevi Tribe, 474 U.S., at  [*106]
11, 106 S. Ct. 298, 88 L. Ed. 2d 9, confirms that the Nation's interpretation of
the statute before the Court of Appeals was correct.

As written, the Kansas fuel tax provisions state that  [HN6] ""the incidence of
this tax is imposed on the distributor of the first receipt of the motor fuel
and such taxes shall be paid but once.  Such tax shall be computed on all
motor-vehicle fuels or special fuels received by each distributor, manufacturer
or importer in this  [***440]  state and paid in the manner provided for herein
. . . ."" Kan. Stat. Ann. § 79-3408(c) (2003 Cum. Supp.).   [HN7] Under this
provision, the distributor who initially receives the motor fuel is liable for
payment of the fuel tax, and the distributor's tax liability is determined by
calculating the amount of fuel received by the distributor.

Section 79-3410(a) (1997) confirms that it is the distributor's off-reservation
receipt of the motor fuel, and not any subsequent event, that establishes tax
liability. That section provides:


      [HN8] ""[E]very distributor, manufacturer, importer, exporter or
     retailer of motor-vehicle fuels or special fuels, on or before the
     25th day of each month, shall render to the director . . . a report
     certified to be true and correct showing the number of gallons of
     motor-vehicle fuels or special fuels received by such distributor,
     manufacturer, importer, exporter or retailer during the preceding
     calendar month . . . .  Every distributor, manufacturer or importer
     within the time herein fixed for the rendering of such reports, shall
     compute and shall pay to the director at the director's office the
     amount of taxes due to the state on all motor-vehicle fuels or special
     fuels received by such distributor, manufacturer or importer during
     the preceding calendar month.""



Thus,  [HN9] Kansas law expressly provides that a distributor's monthly tax
obligations are determined by the amount of fuel received by the distributor
during the preceding month.  See  Kline, 297 F. Supp. 2d, at 1294 (""The
distributor must  [*107]  compute and remit the tax each month for the fuel
received by the distributor in the State of Kansas"").

[***LEdHR1A] [1D]  [***LEdHR4] [4] The Nation disagrees.  It contends that what
is taxed is not the distributors' (off-reservation) receipt of the fuel, but
rather the distributors' use, sale, or delivery of the motor fuel--in this case,
the distributors' (on-reservation) sale or delivery to the Nation.  The Nation
grounds support for this proposition in § 79-3408(a) (2003 Cum. Supp.).  That
section provides that  [HN10] ""[a] tax . . . is hereby imposed on the use, sale
or delivery of all motor vehicle fuels or special fuels which are used, sold or
delivered in this state for any purpose whatsoever."" But this section cannot be
read in isolation.  If it were, it would permit Kansas to tax the same fuel
multiple times--namely, every time fuel is sold, delivered, or used.  Section
79-3408(a) must be read in conjunction with subsection (c), which specifies that
[HN11] ""the incidence of this tax is imposed on the distributor of the first
receipt of the motor fuel and such taxes shall be paid but once."" (Emphasis
added.) The identity of the single, taxable event is revealed in the very next
sentence of subsection (c), which provides that ""[s]uch tax shall be computed on
all . . . fuels received by each distributor."" (Emphasis added.) In short,
[HN12] the ""use, sale or delivery"" that triggers tax liability is the sale or
delivery of the fuel to the distributor. The Kansas Department of Revenue has
issued a final determination reaching the same conclusion.  See Kansas Dept. of
Revenue Letter (""[P]ursuant to the Kansas [**685]  Motor Fuel Tax Act . . . the
state fuel tax was imposed on Davies, a distributor, when Davies first received
the fuel at its business, a site [***441]  located off of Nation's reservation""
(emphasis added)).

[***LEdHR1A] [1E] The Nation claims further support for its interpretation of
the statute in § 79-3408(d) (2003 Cum. Supp.).   [HN13] Section 79-3408(d)
permits distributors to obtain deductions from the Kansas motor fuel tax for
certain postreceipt transactions, such as sale or delivery of fuel for export
from the State and sale or delivery of fuel to the United States.  [*108]  §§
79-3408(d)(1)-(2).  The Nation argues that these exemptions make it impossible
for a distributor to calculate its ""ultimate tax liability"" without knowing
""whether, where, and to whom the fuel is ultimately sold or delivered."" Brief
for Respondent 15.  The Nation infers from these provisions that the taxable
event is actually the distributors' postreceipt delivery of fuel to retailers
such as the Nation, rather than the distributors' initial receipt of the fuel.

The Nation's theory suffers from a number of conceptual defects.  First,  [HN14]
under Kansas law, a distributor must pay the tax even for fuel that sits in its
inventory--fuel that is not (or at least has not yet been) used, sold, or
delivered by the distributor. 3 But the Nation's interpretation presumes that
the tax is owed only on a distributor's postreceipt use, sale, or delivery of
fuel. As this interpretation cannot be reconciled with the manner in which the
Kansas motor fuel tax is [*109]  actually applied, it must be rejected. 4
Second, the availability of tax deductions does not change the nature of the
taxable event, here the distributor's receipt of the fuel. By analogy, an
individual federal income taxpayer may reduce his tax liability by paying home
mortgage interest.  But that entitlement does not render the taxable event
anything other [**686]  than the receipt of income by the taxpayer.  See 26
U.S.C. § 1 (2000 ed. and Supp. II), § 163(h) (2000 ed.); cf.  [***442]    North
American Oil Consol. v. Burnet, 286 U.S. 417, 424, 52 S. Ct. 613, 76 L. Ed.
1197, 1932-1 C.B. 293 (1932) (federal income tax liability arises when ""a
taxpayer . . . has received income"").

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - Footnotes - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

3 This understanding of the application of the Kansas fuel tax is confirmed by
the form that fuel distributors are required to fill out each month pursuant to
Kan. Stat. Ann. § 79-3410 (1997).  See Kansas Form MF-52, available at
http://www.ksrevenue.org/pdf/forms/mf52.pdf (as visited Nov. 21, 2005, and
available in Clerk of Court's case file).  The form instructs distributors to
enter in line 1 ""the total net gallons of gasoline, gasohol and special fuel
received or imported"" during the preceding month.  Id., at 2.  The distributors
may then ""[e]nter the deductions that apply to your business"" in lines
2(a)-to-(e) for the preceding month.  Those deductions include ""[n]et gallons of
fuel exported from Kansas,"" ""[n]et gallons of fuel sold to the U. S.
Government,"" ""[n]et gallons of fuel sold for aviation purposes,"" and ""[n]et
gallons of dyed diesel fuel received for the month,"" the very deductions
described in § 79-3408(d), ibid. (emphasis in original).   [HN15] The
distributor's tax liability is then calculated by subtracting the total
deductions from the total fuel received, and applying the 2.5 percent handling
allowance to the difference.  Thus, the event that generates a distributor's tax
liability is its receipt of fuel. And the distributor must pay tax on that fuel
even if it is not subsequently delivered or sold.  While a distributor may
decrease its tax liability by engaging in transactions that entitle it to
deductions, such as by selling or delivering fuel to an exempt entity like the
United States, its tax liability is unaffected by sales or deliveries to
nonexempt entities like the Nation.

4 Indeed, the dissent acknowledges that tax is owed on fuel a distributor
receives and holds in inventory--and thus implicitly concedes that the
distributors' off-reservation receipt of motor fuel is the event that gives rise
to tax liability. See  post, at 120, 163 L. Ed. 2d, at 448 (opinion of Ginsburg,
J.).  While the dissent contends that such tax is ultimately ""effectively
offset"" by a subsequent delivery of the inventoried fuel, ibid., the dissent
does not explain the meaning of this opaque contention.  A distributor's
subsequent delivery of fuel to the Nation or any other fuel retailer in Kansas
has no effect on tax that it has already paid in a preceding month.  Indeed, the
distributor does not report delivery to retailers on its monthly tax return.
See Kansas Form MF-52.  And a distributor must pay the tax even if the fuel is
never delivered.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Finally, the Nation contends that its interpretation of the statute is supported
by Kan. Stat. Ann. § 79-3417 (1997), which permits a refund--in certain
circumstances--for destroyed fuel. However, the Nation's interpretation is
actually foreclosed by that section.   [HN16] Section 79-3417 entitles a
distributor to a ""refund from the state of the amount of motor-vehicle fuels or
special fuels tax paid on any . . . fuels of 100 gallons or more in quantity,
which are lost or destroyed at any one time while such distributor is the owner
thereof,"" provided the distributor supplies the required notification and
documentation to the State.  This section illustrates that a distributor pays
taxes for fuel in its possession that it has not delivered or sold, and is only
entitled to the refund described in this section for tax it has already paid
[*110]  on fuel that is subsequently destroyed.  While this section does not
specify the event that gives rise to the distributor's tax liability, it
forecloses the Nation's contention that such liability does not arise until fuel
is sold or delivered to a nonexempt entity.

III

[***LEdHR1A] [1F] Although Kansas' fuel tax is imposed on non-Indian
distributors based upon those distributors' off-reservation receipt of motor
fuel, the Tenth Circuit concluded that the tax was nevertheless still subject to
the interest-balancing test this Court set forth in  Bracker, 448 U.S. 136, 100
S. Ct. 2578, 65 L. Ed. 2d 665.  As Bracker itself explained, however,  we
formulated the balancing test to address the ""difficult questio[n]"" that arises
when ""a State asserts authority over the conduct of non-Indians engaging in
activity on the reservation.""  Id., at 144-145, 100 S. Ct. 2578, 65 L. Ed. 2d
665 (emphasis added).  The Bracker interest-balancing test has never been
applied where, as here, the State asserts its taxing authority over non-Indians
off the reservation. And although we have never addressed this precise issue,
our Indian tax immunity cases counsel against such an application.

We have applied the balancing test articulated in Bracker only where ""the legal
incidence of the tax fell on a nontribal entity engaged in a transaction with
tribes or tribal members,""  Arizona Dep't of Revenue v. Blaze Constr. Co., 526
U.S. 32, 37, 119 S. Ct. 957, 143 L. Ed. 2d 27 (1999), on the reservation. See
Bracker, supra (motor carrier license and use fuel taxes imposed on
on-reservation logging and hauling operations by non-Indian contractor);

U.S. 160, 100 S. Ct. 2592, 65 L. Ed. 2d 684 (tax imposed on on-reservation sale

Bracker as supportive of the balancing test were exclusively concerned with the
on-reservation conduct of non-Indians.  See  Warren Trading Post Co. v. Arizona
Tax Comm'n, 380 U.S. 685, 85 S. Ct. 1242, 14 L. Ed. 2d 165 (1965) (gross

5 Our recent discussion in  Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Chickasaw Nation, 515 U.S.
450, 115 S. Ct. 2214, 132 L. Ed. 2d 400 (1995), regarding the application of the
interest-balancing test to motor fuel taxes is not to the contrary.  In
Chickasaw, we noted in dicta that, ""if the legal incidence of the tax rests on
non-Indians, no categorical bar prevents enforcement of the tax; if the balance
of federal, state, and tribal interests favors the State, and federal law is not
to the contrary, the State may impose its levy, and may place on a tribe or
tribal members 'minimal burdens' in collecting the toll.""  Id., at 459 (citation
omitted).  Chickasaw did not purport to expand the applicability of  White
Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U.S. 136, 100 S. Ct. 2578, 65 L. Ed. 2d
665 (1980), to an off-reservation tax on non-Indians.  Indeed, the quoted
sentence reveals that Chickasaw discussed the applicability of the
interest-balancing test in the context of a tax that is collected by the
tribe--a tax that necessarily arises from on-reservation conduct. Moreover, in
purporting to craft a ""'bright-line standard'"" in that case, we noted that
Oklahoma ""generally is free"" to impose the legal incidence of its motor fuel tax
on the consumer--who purchases fuel on the reservation--and then require the
Indian retailers to ""'collect and remit the levy.'""  515 U.S., at 460, 115 S.
Ct. 2214, 132 L. Ed. 2d 400.  If Oklahoma would have been free to impose the
legal incidence of its fuel tax downstream from the Indian retailers, then
Kansas should be equally free to impose the legal incidence of its fuel tax
upstream from Indian retailers notwithstan"
"                JAMES LOCKHART, Petitioner v. UNITED STATES et al.",546 U.S. 142,"

 [**700]   [*143]  Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A] We consider whether the United States may offset Social
Security benefits to collect a student loan debt that has been outstanding for
over 10 years.

I

A

Petitioner James Lockhart failed to repay federally reinsured student loans that
he had incurred between 1984 and 1989 under the Guaranteed Student Loan Program.
These loans were eventually reassigned to the Department of Education, which
certified the debt to the Department of the Treasury through the Treasury Offset
Program.  In 2002, the Government began withholding a portion of petitioner's
Social Security payments to offset his [**701]  debt, some of which was more
than 10 years delinquent.

[*144]  Petitioner sued in Federal District Court, alleging that under the Debt
Collection Act's 10-year statute of limitations, the offset was time barred.
The District Court dismissed the complaint, and the Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit affirmed.   376 F.3d 1027 (2004).  We granted certiorari,  544
U.S. 998, 125 S. Ct. 1928, 161 L. Ed. 2d 772 (2005), to resolve the conflict
between the  [***561]  Ninth Circuit and the Eighth Circuit, see  Lee v. Paige,
376 F.3d 1179 (CA8 2004), and now affirm.

B

[HN1] The Debt Collection Act of 1982, as amended, provides that, after pursuing
the debt collection channels set out in 31 U.S.C. § 3711(a), an agency head can
collect an outstanding debt ""by administrative offset."" § 3716(a).  The
availability of offsets against Social Security benefits is limited, as the
Social Security Act, 49 Stat. 620, as amended, makes Social Security benefits,
in general, not ""subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other
legal process."" 42 U.S.C. § 407(a).  The Social Security Act purports to protect
this anti-attachment rule with an express-reference provision: ""No other
provision of law, enacted before, on, or after April 20, 1983, may be construed
to limit, supersede, or otherwise modify the provisions of this section except
to the extent that it does so by express reference to this section."" § 407(b).

Moreover,  [HN2] the Debt Collection Act's offset provisions generally do not
authorize the collection of claims which, like petitioner's debts at issue here,
are over 10 years old.  31 U.S.C. § 3716(e)(1).  In 1991, however, the Higher
Education Technical Amendments, 105 Stat. 123, sweepingly eliminated time
limitations as to certain loans: ""Notwithstanding any other provision of statute
. . . no limitation shall terminate the period within which suit may be filed, a
judgment may be enforced, or an offset, garnishment, or other action initiated
or taken,"" 20 U.S.C. § 1091a(a)(2), for the repayment  [*145]  of various
student loans, including the loans at issue here, § 1091a(a)(2)(D).

The Higher Education Technical Amendments, by their terms, did not make Social
Security benefits subject to offset; these were still protected by the Social
Security Act's anti-attachment rule.  Only in 1996 did the Debt Collection
Improvement Act--in amending and recodifying the Debt Collection Act--provide
that,  [HN3] ""[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law (including [§ 407] .
. .),"" with a limited exception not relevant here, ""all payment due an
individual under . . . the Social Security Act . . . shall be subject to offset
under this section."" 31 U.S.C. § 3716(c)(3)(A)(i).

II

The Government does not contend that the ""notwithstanding"" clauses in both the
Higher Education Technical Amendments and the Debt Collection Improvement Act
trump the Social Security Act's express-reference provision.  Cf.  Marcello v.
Bonds, 349 U.S. 302, 310, 75 S. Ct. 757, 99 L. Ed. 1107 (1955) (""Exemptions from
the terms of the . .  . Act are not lightly to be presumed in view of the
statement . . . that modifications must be express[.] But . . . [u]nless we are
to require the Congress to employ magical passwords in order to effectuate an
exemption from the . . . Act, we must hold that the present statute expressly
supersedes the . . . provisions of that Act"");  Great Northern R. Co. v. United
States, 208 U.S. 452, 465, 28 S. Ct. 313, 52 L. Ed. 567 (1908).

[**702]  We need not decide the effect of express-reference provisions such as §
407(b) to resolve this case.  Because the Debt Collection Improvement Act
clearly makes Social Security benefits subject to offset, it provides  [***562]
exactly the sort of express reference that the Social Security Act says is
necessary to supersede the anti-attachment provision.

[***LEdHR1A] [1B]  [***LEdHR2] [2] It is clear that the Higher Education
Technical Amendments remove the 10-year limit that would otherwise bar
offsetting petitioner's Social Security benefits to pay off his student loan
debt.  Petitioner argues that Congress could  [*146]  not have intended in 1991
to repeal the Debt Collection Act's statute of limitations as to offsets against
Social Security benefits--since debt collection by Social Security offset was
not authorized until five years later.  Therefore, petitioner continues, the
Higher Education Technical Amendments' abrogation of time limits in 1991 only
applies to then-valid means of debt collection. We disagree.   [HN4] ""The fact
that Congress may not have foreseen all of the consequences of a statutory
enactment is not a sufficient reason for refusing to give effect to its plain
meaning.""  Union Bank v. Wolas, 502 U.S. 151, 158, 112 S. Ct. 527, 116 L. Ed. 2d
514 (1991).

[***LEdHR1A] [1C] Petitioner points out that the Higher Education Technical
Amendments, unlike the Debt Collection Improvement Act, do not explicitly
mention § 407.  But § 407(b) only requires an express reference to authorize
attachment in the first place--which the Debt Collection Improvement Act has
already provided.

III

[***LEdHR1A] [1D] Nor does the Debt Collection Improvement Act's 1996
recodification of the Debt Collection Act help petitioner.   [HN5] The Debt
Collection Improvement Act, in addition to adding offset authority against
Social Security benefits, retained the Debt Collection Act's general 10-year bar
on offset authority.  But the mere retention of this previously enacted time bar
does not make the time bar apply in all contexts--a result that would extend far
beyond Social Security benefits, since it would imply that the Higher Education
Technical Amendments' abrogation of time limits was now a dead letter as to any
kind of administrative offset. Rather, the Higher Education Technical Amendments
retain their effect as a limited exception to the Debt Collection Act time bar
in the student loan context.

Finally, we decline to read any meaning into the failed 2004 effort to amend the
Debt Collection Act to explicitly authorize offset of debts over 10 years old.
See H. R. 5025, 108th Cong., 2d Sess., § 642 (Sept. 8, 2004); S. 2806, 108th
[*147]  Cong., 2d Sess., § 642 (Sept. 15, 2004).   [HN6] ""[F]ailed legislative
proposals are 'a particularly dangerous ground on which to rest an
interpretation of a prior statute.'""  United States v. Craft, 535 U.S. 274, 287,
122 S. Ct. 1414, 152 L. Ed. 2d 437 (2002) (quoting  Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U.S. 633, 650, 110 S. Ct. 2668, 110 L. Ed. 2d 579
(1990)).  In any event, it is unclear what meaning we could read into this
effort even if we were inclined to do so, as the failed amendment--which was not
limited to offsets against Social Security benefits--would have had a different
effect than the interpretation we advance today.

Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.

It is so ordered.

CONCUR BY: SCALIA

CONCUR

 [***563]  Justice Scalia, concurring.

I agree with the Court that, even if the express-reference requirement in §
207(b) of the Social Security Act is binding, it has [**703]  been met here; and
I join the opinion of the Court because it does not imply that the requirement
is binding.  I would go further, however, and say that it is not.

""[O]ne legislature,"" Chief Justice Marshall wrote, ""cannot abridge the powers of
a succeeding legislature.""  Fletcher v. Peck, 10 U.S. 87, 6 Cranch 87, 135, 3 L.
Ed. 162 (1810).  ""The correctness of this principle, so far as respects general
legislation,"" he asserted, ""can never be controverted."" Ibid. See also  Marbury
v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 1 Cranch 137, 177, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803) (unlike the
Constitution, a legislative Act is ""alterable when the legislature shall please
to alter it""); 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 90 (1765)
(""Acts of parliament derogatory from the power of subsequent parliaments bind
not""); T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 125-126 (1868) (reprint 1987).  Our
cases have uniformly endorsed this principle.  See, e.g. ,  United States v.
Winstar Corp., 518 U.S. 839, 872, 116 S. Ct. 2432, 135 L. Ed. 2d 964 (1996)
(plurality opinion);  Reichelderfer v. Quinn, 287 U.S. 315, 318, 53 S. Ct. 177,
77 L. Ed. 331 (1932) (""[T]he will of a particular Congress . . . does not impose
itself upon those to follow in succeeding years"");  Manigault v. Springs, 199
U.S. 473, 487, 26 S. Ct. 127, 50 L. Ed. 274 (1905);  Newton v.  [*148]
Commissioners, 100 U.S. 548, 559, 25 L. Ed. 710 (1880) (in cases involving
""public interests"" and ""public laws,"" ""there can be . . . no irrepealable law"");
see generally 1 L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law § 2-3, p 125, n 1 (3d ed.
2000).

Among the powers of a legislature that a prior legislature cannot abridge is, of
course, the power to make its will known in whatever fashion it deems
appropriate--including the repeal of pre-existing provisions by simply and
clearly contradicting them.  Thus, in  Marcello v. Bonds, 349 U.S. 302, 75 S.
Ct. 757, 99 L. Ed. 1107 (1955), we interpreted the Immigration and Nationality
Act as impliedly exempting deportation hearings from the procedures of the
Administrative Procedure Act (APA), despite the requirement in § 12 of the APA
that ""[n]o subsequent legislation shall be held to supersede or modify the
provisions of this Act except to the extent that such legislation shall do so
expressly,"" 60 Stat. 244.  The Court refused ""to require the Congress to employ
magical passwords in order to effectuate an exemption from the Administrative
Procedure Act.""  349 U.S., at 310, 75 S. Ct. 757, 99 L. Ed. 1107.  We have made
clear in other cases as well, that an express-reference or express-statement
provision cannot nullify the unambiguous import of a subsequent statute.  In
Great Northern R. Co. v. United States, 208 U.S. 452, 465, 28 S. Ct. 313, 52 L.
Ed. 567 (1908), we said of an express-statement requirement that ""[a]s the
section . . . in question has only the force of a statute, its provisions cannot
justify a disregard of the will of Congress as manifested either expressly or by
necessary implication in a subsequent enactment."" (Emphasis added.) A subsequent
Congress, we have said, may exempt itself from such requirements  [***564]  by
""fair implication""--that is, without an express statement.   Warden v. Marrero,
417 U.S. 653, 659-660, n. 10, 94 S. Ct. 2532, 41 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1974).  See also
Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U.S. 205, 218, 30 S. Ct. 621, 54 L. Ed. 1001, T.D. 1636
(1910).

To be sure, legislative express-reference or express-statement requirements may
function as background canons of interpretation of which Congress is
presumptively aware.  For example, we have asserted that exemptions from the
[*149]  APA are ""not lightly to be presumed"" in light of its express-reference
requirement,  Marcello, supra, at 310, 75 S. Ct. 757, 99 L. Ed. 1107; see also
Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U.S. 48, 51, 75 S. Ct. 591, 99 L. Ed. 868 (1955).
That assertion may add little or nothing to our [**704]  already-powerful
presumption against implied repeals.


     ""We have repeatedly stated . . . that absent a clearly established
     congressional intention, repeals by implication are not favored.  An
     implied repeal will only be found where provisions in two statutes are
     in irreconcilable conflict, or where the latter Act covers the whole
     subject of the earlier one and is clearly intended as a substitute.""
     Branch v. Smith, 538 U.S. 254, 273, 123 S. Ct. 1429, 155 L. Ed. 2d 407
     (2003) (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks and citations
     omitted).



See also  Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S 535, 551, 94 S. Ct. 2474, 41 L. Ed. 2d 290
(1974).  When the plain import of a later statute directly conflicts with an
earlier statute, the later enactment governs, regardless of its compliance with
any earlier-enacted requirement of an express reference or other ""magical
password.""

For the reasons set forth in the majority opinion, in the Higher Education
Technical Amendments and the Debt Collection Improvement Act, Congress
unambiguously authorized, without exception, the collection of 10-year-old
student-loan debt by administrative offset of Government payments.  In doing so,
it flatly contradicted, and thereby effectively repealed, part of § 207(a) of
the Social Security Act. This repeal is effective, regardless of whether the
express-reference requirement of § 207(b) is fulfilled.

Despite our jurisprudence on this subject, it is regrettably not uncommon for
Congress to attempt to burden the future exercise of legislative power with
express-reference and express-statement requirements.  See, e.g., 1 U.S.C. § 109
; 5 U.S.C. § 559; 25 U.S.C. § 1735(b); 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-3(b); 50 U.S.C. §§
1547(a)(1), 1621(b).  In the present case, it might seem more respectful of
Congress to refrain from declaring  [*150]  the invalidity of the
express-reference provision.  I suppose that would depend upon which Congress
one has in mind: the prior one that enacted the provision, or the current one
whose clearly expressed legislative intent it is designed to frustrate.  In any
event, I think it does no favor to the Members of Congress, and to those who
assist in drafting their legislation, to keep secret the fact that such
express-reference provisions are ineffective.

 [*648]  [**2566]   Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A]  This case involves two federal prescriptions: the one-year
limitation period imposed on federal habeas corpus petitioners by the
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. §
2244(d)(1); and the rule that pleading amendments relate back to the filing date
of the original pleading when both the original plea and the amendment arise out
of the same ""conduct, transaction, or occurrence,"" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(c)(2)
.

Jacoby Lee Felix, California prisoner and federal habeas petitioner, was
convicted in California state court of first-degree murder and second-degree
robbery, and received a life sentence. Within the one-year limitation period
AEDPA allows for habeas petitions, Felix filed a pro se petition in federal
court.  He initially alleged, inter alia, that the admission into evidence of
videotaped testimony of a witness for the prosecution violated his rights under
the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause.  Five months after the expiration of
AEDPA's time limit, and eight months after the federal court appointed counsel
to represent him, Felix filed  [*649]  an amended petition in which he added a
new claim for relief: He asserted that, in the course of pretrial interrogation,
the police used coercive tactics to obtain damaging statements from him, and
that admission of those statements at trial violated his Fifth Amendment right
against self-incrimination. The question presented concerns the timeliness of
Felix's Fifth Amendment claim.

[HN1] In ordinary civil proceedings, the governing Rule, Rule 8 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure, requires only ""a short and plain statement of the
claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.
8(a)(2).  Rule 2(c) of the Rules Governing Habeas Corpus Cases requires a more
detailed statement.  The habeas rule instructs the petitioner to ""specify all
the grounds for relief available to [him]"" and to ""state the facts supporting
each ground."" 1  [HN2] By statute, Congress provided that a habeas petition ""may
be amended . . . as provided in the rules of procedure applicable to civil
actions."" 28 U.S.C. § 2242.  The Civil Rule on amended pleadings, Rule 15 of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, instructs:  [HN3] ""An amendment of a pleading
relates back to the date of the original pleading when . . . the claim . . .
asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or
occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading.""

The issue before us is one on which federal appellate courts have divided:
Whether, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(2), Felix's amended
petition, filed after AEDPA's one-year limitation and targeting his pretrial
statements, relates back to the date of his original timely filed petition,
which targeted the videotaped witness testimony.  Felix urges, and the Court of
Appeals held, that the  [*650]  amended petition qualifies for  [***590]
relation back because both the original petition and the amended pleading arose
from the same trial and conviction.  We reverse the Court of Appeals' judgment
in this regard.   [HN4] An amended habeas petition, we hold, does not relate
back (and thereby escape AEDPA's one-year time limit) when it asserts a new
ground for relief supported by facts that differ in both time and type from
those the original pleading set forth.

In 1995, after a jury trial in Sacramento, California, respondent Jacoby Lee
Felix was found guilty of murder and robbery stemming from his participation in
a carjacking in which the driver of the car was shot and killed.  App. E to Pet.
for Cert. 2-7.  He was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of
parole.  App. C to Pet. for Cert. 1-2.  The current controversy centers on two
alleged errors at Felix's trial.  Both involve the admission of out-of-court
statements during the prosecutor's case in chief, but the two are otherwise
unrelated. One prompted a Fifth Amendment self-incrimination objection
originally raised in the trial court, the other, a Sixth Amendment Confrontation
Clause challenge, also raised in the trial proceedings.

Felix's Fifth Amendment claim rested on the prosecution's introduction of
statements Felix made during pretrial police interrogation. These statements
were adduced at trial on direct examination of the investigating officer.  Felix
urged that the police used coercive tactics to elicit the statements.  Id., at
8-9.  His Sixth Amendment claim related to the admission of the videotaped
statements prosecution witness Kenneth Williams made at a jailhouse interview.
The videotape records Williams, a friend of Felix, telling the police that he
had overheard a conversation in which Felix described the planned robbery just
before it occurred.  When Williams testified at trial that he did not recall the
police interview, the trial court determined that Williams' loss of  [*651]
memory was feigned, and that the videotape was admissible because it contained
prior inconsistent statements.  App. E to Pet. for Cert. 10-13.

On direct appeal, Felix urged, inter alia, that the admission of Williams'
videotaped statements violated Felix's constitutional right to confront the
witnesses against him.  He did not, however, argue that admission of his own
pretrial statements violated his right to protection against self-incrimination.
The intermediate appellate court affirmed Felix's conviction and sentence, id.,
at 10-13, 17, and the California Supreme Court denied his petition for review,
App. F to Pet. for Cert. 2.  Felix's conviction became final on August 12, 1997.
App. C to Pet. for Cert. 10.

Under AEDPA's one-year statute of limitations, Felix had until August 12, 1998,
to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court.  See §
2244(d)(1)(A).  Within the one-year period, on May 8, 1998, he filed a pro se
petition for federal habeas relief.  Felix's federal petition repeated his Sixth
Amendment objection to the admission of the Williams videotape, but he again
failed to reassert the objection he made in the trial court to the admission of
his own pretrial statements.  App. G to Pet. for Cert. 1-7.  On May 29, 1998, a
Magistrate Judge appointed counsel to represent Felix.  App. C to Pet. for Cert.
6; App. H to Pet. for Cert.  [***591]  2.  Thereafter, on September 15, 1998,
the Magistrate Judge ordered Felix to file an amended petition within 30 days.
Id., at 3.  On Felix's unopposed requests, that period was successively
extended.  Id., at 4-5.  Pending the filing of an amended petition, the State
was not required to interpose an answer.

On January 28, 1999, over five months after the August 12, 1998 expiration of
AEDPA's time limit, and eight months after the appointment of counsel to
represent him, Felix filed an amended petition. Id., at 5.  In this pleading, he
reasserted his Confrontation Clause claim, and also asserted, for the first time
post-trial, that his own pretrial statements to  [*652]  the police were coerced
and therefore inadmissible at trial.  App. I to Pet. for Cert. 4.  Further,
[**2568] he alleged that his counsel on appeal to the California intermediate
appellate court was ineffective in failing to raise the coerced confession claim
on direct appeal.  Id., at 18-19. 2 In its answer to the amended petition, the
State asserted that the Fifth Amendment claim was time barred because it was
initially raised after the expiration of AEDPA's one-year limitation period.
Felix argued in response that the new claim related back to the date of his
original petition. Because both Fifth Amendment and Confrontation Clause claims
challenged the constitutionality of the same criminal conviction, Felix urged,
the Fifth Amendment claim arose out of the ""conduct, transaction, or occurrence
set forth . . . in the original pleading,"" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(c)(2).  App.

2 Because Felix had not presented his coerced statements Fifth Amendment claim
on appeal to the California courts, the State moved to dismiss the amended
petition on the ground that it contained both exhausted and unexhausted claims.
See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A); Brief for Respondent 6-7.  Before the Magistrate
Judge acted on the motion, Felix presented the coerced
statements/ineffective-assistance claim to the California Supreme Court in a
habeas petition. Opposition to Respondents' Motion to Dismiss in No. Civ.
S-98-0828 WBS GGH P (ED Cal.), p 3.  After that court denied the petition
without comment, the State withdrew its motion to dismiss.  See Request to

pp 1-2.

 The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal of Felix's Fifth Amendment coerced
statements claim.  Relation back was not in order, the Magistrate said, because
Felix's ""allegedly involuntary statements to police d[id] not arise out of the
same conduct, transaction or occurrence as the videotaped interrogation of
[prosecution witness] Kenneth Williams."" Ibid It did not suffice, the Magistrate
observed, that Felix's Fifth and Sixth Amendment claims attack the same criminal
conviction.  Ibid. Adopting the Magistrate Judge's report and recommendation in
full, the District  [*653]  Court dismissed the Fifth Amendment claim as time
barred, and rejected the Confrontation Clause claim on its merits.  App. B to
Pet. for Cert. 1-3.

A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the
District Court's dismissal of Felix's Confrontation Clause claim, but reversed
the dismissal of his coerced statements claim and remanded that claim for
further proceedings.  379 F.3d 612 (2004).  In the majority's view, the relevant
""transaction"" for purposes of Rule 15(c)(2) was Felix's ""trial and conviction in
state court.""  Id., at 615.  Defining the transaction at any greater level of
specificity, the  [***592]  majority reasoned, would ""unduly strai[n] the usual
meaning of 'conduct, transaction, or occurrence'"" by dividing the ""trial and
conviction [into] a series of perhaps hundreds of individual occurrences."" Ibid.
Judge Tallman concurred in part and dissented in part.  In his view, defining
""conduct, transaction, or occurrence"" under Rule 15(c)(2) ""so broadly that any
claim stemming from pre-trial motions, the trial, or sentencing relates back to
a timely-filed habeas petition"" would ""obliterat[e] AEDPA's one year statute of
limitation.""  Id., at 618.  ""While an amendment offered to clarify or amplify
the facts already alleged in support of a timely claim may relate back,"" he
reasoned, ""an amendment that introduces a new legal theory based on facts
different from those underlying the timely claim may not.""  Id., at 621.

We granted certiorari, 543 U.S. 1042, 160 L. Ed. 2d 610, 125 S. Ct. 824 (2005),
to resolve the conflict among Courts of Appeals on relation back of habeas
petition amendments.  Compare 379 F.3d at 614 ( [**2569]  if original petition
is timely filed, amendments referring to the same trial and conviction may
relate back); Ellzey v. United States, 324 F.3d 521, 525-527 (CA7 2003) (same),
with United States v. Hicks, 350 U.S. App. D.C. 279, 283 F.3d 380, 388-389 (CADC
2002) (relevant transaction must be defined more narrowly than the trial and
conviction); United States v. Espinoza-Saenz, 235 F.3d 501, 503-505 (CA10 2000)
(same); Davenport v. United States, 217 F.3d 1341, 1344-1346 (CA11 2000) (same);

Craycraft, 167 F.3d 451, 457 (CA8 1999) (same).  We now reverse the Ninth
Circuit's judgment to the extent that it allowed relation back of Felix's Fifth
Amendment claim.

 [HN7]  [***LEdHR2A]  A discrete set of Rules governs federal habeas proceedings
launched by state prisoners. See Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the
United States District Courts. 4 The last of those Rules, Habeas Corpus Rule 11,
permits application of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in habeas cases ""to
the extent that [the civil rules] are not inconsistent with any statutory
provisions or [the habeas] rules."" See also Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 81(a)(2) (The
civil rules ""are applicable to proceedings for . . . habeas corpus."").  Rule 11,
the Advisory Committee's Notes caution, ""permits application of the civil rules
only when it would be appropriate to do  [***593]  so,"" and would not be
""inconsistent or inequitable in the overall framework of habeas corpus.""
Advisory Committee's Note on Habeas Corpus Rule 11, 28 U.S.C., p. 480.  In
addition to the general prescriptions on application of the civil rules in
federal  [*655]  habeas cases, § 2242 specifically provides that habeas
applications ""may be amended . . . as provided in the rules of procedure
applicable to civil actions.""

nature. See, e.g.,  Fisher v. Baker, 203 U.S. 174, 181, 51 L. Ed. 142, 27 S. Ct.
135 (1906).

 [HN9] The Civil Rule governing pleading amendments, Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 15, made applicable to habeas proceedings by § 2242, Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 81(a)(2), and Habeas Corpus Rule 11, allows pleading amendments
with ""leave of court"" any time during a proceeding.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.
15(a).  Before a responsive pleading is served, pleadings may be amended once as
a ""matter of course,"" i.e., without seeking court leave.  Ibid. Amendments made
after the statute of limitations has run relate back to the date of the original
pleading if the original and amended pleadings ""ar[i]se out of the conduct,
transaction, or occurrence."" Rule 15(c)(2).

[HN10]  [***LEdHR3] [3]  [***LEdHR4] [4] The ""original pleading""  to which Rule
15 refers is the complaint in an ordinary civil case, and the petition in a
habeas [**2570]  proceeding.  Under Rule 8(a), applicable to ordinary civil
proceedings, a complaint need only provide ""fair notice of what the plaintiff's
claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.""  Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41,
47, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80, 78 S. Ct. 99 (1957).  Habeas Corpus Rule 2(c) is more
demanding.  It provides that the petition must ""specify all the grounds for
relief available to the petitioner"" and ""state the facts supporting each
ground."" See also Advisory Committee's Note on subd. (c) of Habeas Corpus Rule
2, 28 U.S.C., p. 469 (""In the past, petitions have frequently contained mere
conclusions of law, unsupported by any facts.  [But] it is the relationship of
the facts to the claim asserted that is important . . . .""); Advisory
Committee's Note on Habeas Corpus Rule 4, 28 U.S.C., p. 471 (""'[N]otice'
pleading is not sufficient, for the petition is expected to state facts that
point to a real possibility of constitutional error."" (internal quotation marks
omitted)).  Accordingly, the model form available to aid prisoners in filing
their habeas petitions instructs in boldface:


      [*656]  ""CAUTION: You must include in this petition all the grounds
     for relief from the conviction or sentence that you challenge.  And
     you must state the facts that support each ground.  If you fail to set
     forth all the grounds in this petition, you may be barred from
     presenting additional grounds at a later date."" Petition for Relief
     From a Conviction or Sentence By a Person in State Custody, Habeas
     Corpus Rules, Forms App., 28 U.S.C.A., P. 685 (2000ed. Supp.)
     (emphasis in original).



 [HN11] A prime purpose of Rule 2(c)'s demand that habeas petitioners plead with
particularity is to assist the district court in determining whether the State
should be ordered to ""show cause why the writ should not be granted."" § 2243.
Under Habeas Corpus Rule 4, if ""it plainly appears from the petition . . . that
the petitioner is not entitled to relief in the district court,"" the court must
summarily dismiss the petition without ordering a responsive pleading. If the
court orders the State to file an answer, that pleading must ""address  [***594]
the allegations in the petition."" Rule 5(b).

B

[***LEdHR1A]  This case turns on the meaning of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
15(c)(2)'s relation-back provision in the context of federal habeas proceedings
and AEDPA's one-year statute of limitations. Rule 15(c)(2), as earlier stated,
provides that pleading amendments relate back to the date of the original
pleading when the claim asserted in the amended plea ""arose out of the conduct,
transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the
original pleading."" The key words are ""conduct, transaction, or occurrence."" The
Ninth Circuit, whose judgment we here review, in accord with the Seventh
Circuit, defines those words to allow relation back of a claim first asserted in
an amended petition, so long as the new claim stems from the habeas petitioner's
trial, conviction, or sentence. Under that comprehensive definition,  [*657]
virtually any new claim introduced in an amended petition will relate back, for
federal habeas claims, by their very nature, challenge the constitutionality of
a conviction or sentence, and commonly attack proceedings anterior thereto.  See
Espinoza-Saenz, 235 F.3d at 505 (A ""majority of amendments"" to habeas petitions
raise issues falling under the ""broad umbrella"" of ""a defendant's trial and
sentencing.""); Hicks, 283 F.3d at 388.

The majority of Circuits, mindful of ""Congress'  decision to expedite collateral
attacks by placing stringent time restrictions on [them],"" ibid., define
""conduct, transaction, or occurrence"" in federal habeas cases less broadly.  See
id., at 388-389; [**2571]   Espinoza-Saenz, 235 F.3d at 503-505; Davenport, 217
F.3d, at 1344-1346; Pittman, 209 F.3d, at 317-318;  Duffus, 174 F.3d, at 337;
Craycraft, 167 F.3d, at 457.  They allow relation back only when the claims
added by amendment arise from the same core facts as the timely filed claims,
and not when the new claims depend upon events separate in ""both time and type""
from the originally raised episodes.  Ibid.  Because Felix's own pretrial
statements, newly raised in his amended petition, were separated in time and
type from witness Williams' videotaped statements, raised in Felix's original
petition, the former would not relate back under the definition of ""conduct,
transaction, or occurrence"" to which most Circuits adhere.

We are not aware, in the run-of-the-mine civil proceedings Rule 15 governs, of
any reading of ""conduct, transaction,  or occurrence"" as capacious as the
construction the Ninth and Seventh Circuits have adopted for habeas cases.
Compare Maegdlin v. International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, 309
F.3d 1051, 1052 (CA8 2002) (allowing relation back where original complaint
alleged that defendant union had breached its duty of fair representation by
inadequately representing plaintiff because of his gender, and amended complaint
asserted a Title VII gender discrimination claim based on the same differential
treatment); Clipper  [*658]  Exxpress v. Rocky Mountain Motor Tariff Bureau,
Inc., 690 F.2d 1240, 1246, 1259, n. 29 (CA9 1982) (claim asserting that
defendant included fraudulent information in rate protests filed with the
Interstate Commerce Commission related back to original complaint, which
asserted that defendant filed the same  [***595]  rate protests ""for the purpose
of . . . restricting . . . competition"" (internal quotation marks omitted)); 5
Santana v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 686 F.2d 736, 738 (CA9 1982) (original complaint

defendant's making allegedly untruthful statements about plaintiff's behavior to
plaintiff's employer); Rural Fire Protection Co. v. Hepp, 366 F.2d 355, 361-362
(CA9 1966) (in a Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 suit alleging minimum wage
violations for certain pay periods, amendment asserting the same type of
violation during an additional pay period related back), with Nettis v. Levitt,
241 F.3d 186, 193 (CA2 2001) (disallowing relation back where Nettis' original
complaint alleged that his employer retaliated in response to Nettis' objections
to employer's sales tax collection procedure, and amendment alleged retaliation
for Nettis' report of payroll and inventory irregularities); Browning Mfg. v.
Mims (In re Coastal Plains, Inc.), 179 F.3d 197, 216 (CA5 1999) (Coastal
Plains's claim that creditor interfered with business relations by attempting
[*659]  to sell Coastal Plains to a third party did not relate back to claim
based on creditor's failure to return inventory to Coastal Plains, even though
both claims were  [**2572] linked to creditor's alleged ""broader plan to destroy
Coastal [Plains]""); Sierra Club v. Penfold, 857 F.2d 1307, 1315-1316 (CA9 1988)
(where original complaint challenged the manner in which an agency applied a
regulation, an amendment challenging the agency's ""conduct in adopting the
regulatio[n]"" did not relate back).  See also Jackson v. Suffolk County Homicide
Bureau, 135 F.3d 254, 256 (CA2 1998) (although all of plaintiff's 42 U.S.C. §
1983 claims arose out of a single state-court criminal proceeding, plaintiff's
First Amendment claims did not arise out of the same conduct as the originally
asserted excessive force claims, and therefore did not relate back).  As these
decisions illustrate,  [HN12] Rule 15(c)(2) relaxes, but does not obliterate,
the statute of limitations; hence relation back depends on the existence of a
common ""core of operative facts"" uniting the original and newly asserted claims.
See Clipper Exxpress, 690 F.2d, at 1259, n. 29; 6A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M.
Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1497, p 85 (2d ed. 1990).

5 The dissent asserts that Clipper Exxpress is comparable to this case in
according Rule 15(c)(2) a ""'capacious'"" reading.  Post, at 668, n 2, 162 L. Ed.
2d, at 601.  Clipper Exxpress involved a series of allegedly sham protests,
commonly designed to restrain trade, a charge of the pattern or practice type.
The amendment in question added a fraud charge, a new legal theory tied to the
same operative facts as those initially alleged.  690 F.2d, at 1259, n. 29.
That unremarkable application of the relation-back rule bears little resemblance
to the argument made by Felix and embraced by the dissent--that all manner of
factually and temporally unrelated conduct may be raised after the statute of
limitations has run and relate back, so long as the new and originally pleaded
claims challenge the same conviction.  See infra, at 659-661, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at
595-597.

 Felix asserts that he seeks, and the Ninth Circuit accorded, no wider range for
Rule 15(c)'s relation-back provision than this Court gave to the Rule's key
words ""conduct, transaction, or occurrence"" in Tiller v. Atlantic Coast Line R.
Co., 323 U.S. 574, 580-581, 89 L. Ed. 465, 65 S. Ct. 421 (1945).  We disagree.
In Tiller, a railroad worker was struck and killed by a railroad car.  His widow
[***596]  sued under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U.S.C. § 51 et seq
, to recover for his wrongful death.  She initially alleged various negligent
acts.  In an amended complaint, she added a claim under the Federal Boiler
Inspection Act for failure to provide the train's locomotive with a rear light.
We held that the amendment related back, and therefore avoided a statute of
limitations bar, even though the amendment invoked a legal theory not suggested
by the original complaint and relied on facts not originally asserted.

[*660]  There was but one episode-in-suit in Tiller, a worker's death attributed
from the start to the railroad's failure to provide its employee with a
reasonably safe place to work.  The federal rulemakers recognized that personal
injury plaintiffs often cannot pinpoint the precise cause of an injury prior to
discovery.  See 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1215,
pp 138-143 (2d ed. 1990).  They therefore included in the Appendix to the
Federal Rules an illustrative form indicating that a personal injury plaintiff
could adequately state a claim for relief simply by alleging that the defendant
negligently operated a certain instrumentality at a particular time and place.
See Form 9, Complaint for Negligence, Forms App., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc., 28
U.S.C. App., p 829.  The widow in Tiller met that measure.  She based her
complaint on a single ""occurrence,"" an accident resulting in her husband's
death.  In contrast, Felix targeted separate episodes, the pretrial police
interrogation of witness Williams in his original petition and his own
interrogation at a different time and place in his amended petition.

Felix contends, however, that his amended petition qualifies for relation back
because the trial itself is the ""transaction"" or ""occurrence"" that counts.  See
Brief for Respondent 21-23.  Citing Chavez v. Martinez, 538 U.S. 760, 155 L. Ed.
2d 984, 123 S. Ct. 1994 (2003) (plurality opinion), Felix urges that neither the
videotaped interview with witness Williams nor the pretrial police interrogation
to which Felix himself was exposed transgressed any constitutional limitation.
Until the statements elicited by the police were introduced at trial, Felix
argues, he had no actionable claim at all.  Both the confrontation right he
timely presented [**2573]  and the privilege against self-incrimination he
asserted in his amended petition are ""trial right[s],"" Felix underscores.  Brief
for Respondent 21 (emphasis deleted).  His claims based on those rights, he
maintains, are not ""separate,"" id., at 22; rather, they are related in time and
type, for ""they arose on successive days during the trial and both  [*661]
challenged [on constitutional grounds] admission of pretrial statements,"" id.,
at 22-23.

Felix artificially truncates his claims by homing in only on what makes them
actionable in a habeas proceeding.  We do not here question his assertion that
his Fifth Amendment right did not ripen until his statements were admitted
against him at trial.  See Chavez, 538 U.S., at 766-767, 155 L. Ed. 2d 984, 123
S. Ct. 1994.  Even so, the essential predicate for his self-incrimination claim
was an extrajudicial event, i.e., an out-of-court police interrogation.  [HN13]
The dispositive question in an adjudication of that claim would be the character
of Felix's conduct, not in court, but at the police interrogation, specifically,
did he answer voluntarily  [***597]  or were his statements coerced. See Haynes
v. Washington, 373 U.S. 503, 513-514, 10 L. Ed. 2d 513, 83 S. Ct. 1336 (1963)
(voluntariness is evaluated by examining the ""totality of circumstances""
surrounding the ""making and signing of the challenged confession"").

Habeas Corpus Rule 2(c), we earlier noted, see supra, at 655-656, 162 L. Ed. 2d,
at 593, instructs petitioners to ""specify all [available] grounds for relief""
and to ""state the facts supporting each ground."" Under that Rule, Felix's
Confrontation Clause claim would be pleaded discretely, as would his self -
incrimination claim.  Each separate congeries of facts supporting the grounds
for relief, the Rule suggests, would delineate an ""occurrence."" Felix's
approach, the approach that prevailed in the Ninth Circuit, is boundless by
comparison.  A miscellany of claims for relief could be raised later rather than
sooner and relate back, for ""conduct, transaction, or occurrence"" would be
defined to encompass any pretrial, trial, or post-trial error that could provide
a basis for challenging the conviction.  An approach of that breadth, as the
Fourth Circuit observed, ""views 'occurrence' at too high a level of generality.""

"             ANTHONY KANE, WARDEN, Petitioner v. JOE GARCIA ESPITIA",546 U.S. 9,"

 [*9]  [***12]

 [**408] Per Curiam.

Respondent Garcia Espitia, a criminal defendant who chose to proceed pro se, was
convicted in California state court of carjacking and other offenses.  He had
received no law library access while in jail before trial--despite his repeated
requests and court orders to the contrary--and only about four hours of access
during trial, just before closing arguments.  (Of course, he had declined, as
was his right, to be represented by a lawyer with unlimited access to legal
materials.) The California courts rejected his argument that his restricted
library access violated his Sixth Amendment rights.  Once his sentence became
final, he petitioned in Federal District Court for a writ of habeas corpus under
28 U.S.C.  § 2254.  The District Court denied relief, but the  [*10]  Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that ""the lack of any pretrial
access to lawbooks violated Espitia's constitutional right to represent himself
as established by the Supreme Court in  Faretta [v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 95
S. Ct. 2525, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975)].""  Garcia Espitia v. Ortiz, 113 Fed. Appx.
802, 804 (2004).  The warden's petition for certiorari and respondent's motion
for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted, the judgment below is
reversed, and the case is remanded.

[HN1] A necessary condition for federal habeas relief here is that the state
court's decision be ""contrary to, or involv[e] an unreasonable application of,
clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the
United States.""  § 2254(d)(1).  Neither the opinion below, nor any of the
appellate cases it relies on, identifies a source in our case law for the law
library access right other than Faretta. See id., at 804 (relying on  [***13]
Bribiesca v. Galaza, 215 F.3d 1015, 1020 (CA9 2000) (quoting  Milton v. Morris,
767 F.2d 1443, 1446 (CA9 1985))); ibid. (""Faretta controls this case"").

The federal appellate courts have split on whether Faretta, which establishes a
Sixth Amendment right to self-representation, implies a right of the pro se
defendant to have access to a law library.  Compare  Milton, supra, with  United
States v. Smith, 907 F.2d 42, 45 (CA6 1990) (""[B]y knowingly and intelligently
waiving his right to counsel, the appellant also relinquished his access to a
law library"");  United States ex rel. George v. Lane, 718 F.2d 226, 231 (CA7
1983) (similar).  That question cannot be resolved here, however, as it is clear
that  [HN2] Faretta does not, as § 2254(d)(1) requires, ""clearly establis[h]""
the law library access right.  In fact, Faretta says nothing about any specific
legal aid that the State owes a pro se criminal defendant.  The Bribiesca court
and the court below therefore erred in holding, based on Faretta, that a
violation of a law library access right is a basis for federal habeas relief.

[**409]  [*11]   The judgment below is reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

 [*464]  [**1132]   Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]  Midway through a jury trial, the judge acquitted
petitioner of one of the three offenses charged.  The question presented in this
case is whether the Double Jeopardy Clause forbade the judge to reconsider that
acquittal later in the trial.

I

Petitioner Melvin Smith was tried before a jury in the Superior Court of Suffolk
County, Massachusetts, on charges relating to the shooting of his girlfriend's
cousin.  The indictments charged three counts: armed assault with intent to
murder; assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon; and unlawful
possession of a firearm.  [HN1] The ""firearm"" element of the last offense
requires proof that the weapon had a barrel ""less than 16 inches"" in length.
See Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 140, § 121 (West 2002) (definition of ""firearm"");
ch. 269, § 10(a) (West 2000).  The indictment in petitioner's case so charged.
Petitioner's girlfriend was tried before the same jury as an accessory after the
fact.

[*465]  The victim testified at trial that petitioner had shot him with ""a
pistol,"" specifically ""a revolver"" that ""appeared to be a .32 or a .38."" App.
12, 14.  The prosecution introduced no other evidence about the firearm.

At the conclusion of the prosecution's case, petitioner moved for a required
finding of not guilty on the firearm count, see Mass. Rule Crim. Proc. 25(a)
(2002), in part because the Commonwealth had not proved that the gun barrel was
less than 16 inches.  At sidebar, after hearing argument from the prosecutor,
the trial judge granted the motion, reasoning that there was ""not a scintilla of
evidence"" that petitioner had possessed a weapon with a barrel [**1133]  length
of less than 16 inches.  App. 21.  The trial court marked petitioner's motion
with the handwritten endorsement ""Filed and after hearing, Allowed,"" and the
allowance of the motion was entered on the docket.  Consolidated Brief and
Record Appendix for Defendant in No. 00-P-1215 (Mass App Ct), p A.21; App. 3.
The sidebar conference then concluded, and the prosecution rested. 1 The judge
did not notify the jury of petitioner's acquittal on the firearm count.

requesting to reopen and allow [the victim] to testify to"" the barrel length,
App. 22, he made no motion to reopen before resting his case.

The defense case then proceeded. Petitioner's codefendant presented one witness,
and both defendants then rested. During the short recess before closing
arguments, the prosecutor brought to the court's attention a Massachusetts
precedent under which (he contended) the victim's testimony about the kind of
gun sufficed to establish that the barrel was shorter than 16 inches.  He
requested that the court defer ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence until
after the jury verdict. The judge agreed, announcing orally that she was
""reversing"" her previous ruling and allowing the firearm-possession count to go
to the jury.  Id., at 75.  Corresponding  [*466]  notations were made on the
original of petitioner's motion and on the docket.

[***922]  The jury convicted petitioner on all three counts, though it acquitted
his codefendant of the accessory charge.  Petitioner then submitted to a bench
trial on an additional repeat-offender element of the firearm-possession charge;
the judge found him guilty.  Petitioner received a sentence of 10 to 12 years'
incarceration on the firearm-possession charge, concurrent with his sentence on
the other counts.

Petitioner sought review in the Appeals Court of Massachusetts.  That court
affirmed, holding that the Double Jeopardy Clause was not implicated because the
trial judge's correction of her ruling had not subjected petitioner to a second
prosecution or proceeding.  It also rejected petitioner's argument that the
trial judge's initial ruling was final because Massachusetts Rule of Criminal
Procedure 25(a) required the judge to decide petitioner's motion when it was
made, without reserving decision; 2 the court reasoned that the Rule does not
preclude the judge from reconsidering.   58 Mass. App. 166, 170-171, 788 N.E.2d
977, 982-983 (2003).

any part thereof after the evidence on either side is closed if the evidence is
insufficient as a matter of law to sustain a conviction on the charge.  If a
defendant's motion for a required finding of not guilty is made at the close of
the Commonwealth's evidence, it shall be ruled upon at that time."" (Emphasis

[***LEdHR3] [3]   [HN3] Although the common-law protection against double
jeopardy historically applied only to charges on which a jury had rendered a
verdict, see, e.g., 2 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown  [*467]  *246, we have long
held that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits
reexamination of a court-decreed acquittal to the same extent it prohibits
reexamination of an acquittal by jury verdict. See  Richardson [**1134]  v.
United States, 468 U.S. 317, 325, n. 5, 82 L. Ed. 2d 242, 104 S. Ct. 3081 (1984)
;  Sanabria v. United States, 437 U.S. 54, 64, n. 18, 57 L. Ed. 2d 43, 98 S. Ct.
2170 (1978);  United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U.S. 564, 573, 51 L.
Ed. 2d 642, 97 S. Ct. 1349 (1977);  United States v. Sisson, 399 U.S. 267, 290,
26 L. Ed. 2d 608, 90 S. Ct. 2117 (1970).  This is so whether the judge's ruling
of acquittal comes in a bench trial or, as here, in a trial by jury.  See  Fong
Foo v. United States, 369 U.S. 141, 143, 7 L. Ed. 2d 629, 82 S. Ct. 671 (1962)
(per curiam);  Sanabria, supra, at 77-78;  Martin Linen, supra, at 565-566,
574-575, 51 L. Ed. 2d 642, 97 S. Ct. 1349.

[HN4] Our cases have made a single exception to the principle that acquittal by
judge precludes reexamination of guilt no less than acquittal by jury: When a
jury returns a verdict of guilty and a trial judge (or an appellate court) sets
aside that verdict and enters a judgment of acquittal, the Double Jeopardy
Clause does not preclude a prosecution appeal to reinstate the jury verdict of
guilty.   United States v. Wilson, 420 U.S. 332, 352-353, 43 L. Ed. 2d 232, 95
S. Ct.  [***923]  1013 (1975).  But if the prosecution has not yet obtained a
conviction, further proceedings to secure one are impermissible: ""[S]ubjecting
the defendant to postacquittal factfinding proceedings going to guilt or
innocence violates the Double Jeopardy Clause.""  Smalis v. Pennsylvania, 476
U.S. 140, 145, 90 L. Ed. 2d 116, 106 S. Ct. 1745 (1986).

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]  When the judge in this case first granted
petitioner's motion, there had been no jury verdict. Submission of the firearm
count to the jury plainly subjected petitioner to further ""factfinding
proceedings going to guilt or innocence,"" prohibited by Smalis following an
acquittal.  The first question, then, is whether the judge's initial ruling on
petitioner's motion was, in fact, a judgment of acquittal.

It certainly appeared to be.   [HN5]  Massachusetts Rule of Criminal Procedure
25(a) directs the trial judge to enter a finding of not guilty ""if the evidence
is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain a conviction."" An order entering
such a finding  [*468]  thus meets the definition of acquittal that our double
jeopardy cases have consistently used: It ""actually represents a resolution,
correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.""
Martin Linen, supra, at 571, 51 L. Ed. 2d 642, 97 S. Ct. 1349; accord, e.g.,
Price v. Vincent, 538 U.S. 634, 640, 155 L. Ed. 2d 877, 123 S. Ct. 1848 (2003);
Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 10, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1, 98 S. Ct. 2141 (1978).

[***LEdHR2A]  The Commonwealth contends that the grant of a motion for a
required finding of not guilty in a jury trial is a purely legal determination,
the factfinding function being reserved to the jury.  Brief for Respondent 14
(citing  Commonwealth v. Lowder, 432 Mass. 92, 96-97, 731 N.E.2d 510, 515 (2000)
).  Thus, the Commonwealth reasons, jeopardy did not terminate midtrial on any
of the three counts, since neither judge nor jury had rendered a factual
determination that would bring jeopardy to an end.  We rejected identical
reasoning in  Martin Linen, supra, holding that jeopardy ends when,  following
discharge of a hung jury, a judge grants a motion for judgment of acquittal
under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29.  Rule 29 created the judge-ordered
""judgment of acquittal"" in place of the directed verdict, which was at least
fictionally returned by the jury at the judge's direction, rather than coming
from the judge alone.  But, we said in Martin Linen, change in nomenclature and
removal of the jury's theoretical role make no difference; the Rule 29 judgment
of acquittal is a substantive determination that the prosecution has failed to
carry its burden.  Thus, even when the jury is the primary factfinder,  [**1135]
the trial judge still resolves elements of the offense in granting a Rule 29
motion in the absence of a jury verdict. See  Martin Linen, supra, at 571-575,
51 L. Ed. 2d 642, 97 S. Ct. 1349.

The same is true here.  (Indeed, Massachusetts patterned its Rule 25 on Federal
Rule 29 and adopted prior directed-verdict practice without change.  See  Lowder
, supra, at 95, 731 N. E. 2d, at 514.) Massachusetts' characterization of the
required finding of not guilty as a legal rather than factual determination is,
""as a matter of double jeopardy law, . . .  [*469]  not binding on us,""  Smalis,
supra, at 144, n. 5, 90 L. Ed. 2d 116, 106 S. Ct. 1745; what matters is that, as
the Massachusetts Rules authorize, the  [***924]  judge ""evaluated the
[Commonwealth's] evidence and determined that it was legally insufficient to
sustain a conviction.""  Martin Linen, supra, at 572, 51 L. Ed. 2d 642, 97 S. Ct.
1349.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR4A]   [***LEdHR5A]   [***LEdHR6A]  Having
concluded that the judge acquitted petitioner of the firearm-possession charge,
3 we must turn to the more difficult question whether the Double Jeopardy Clause
permitted her to reconsider that acquittal once petitioner and his codefendant
had rested their cases. 4

3  [***LEdHR4A]  It is of no moment that jeopardy continued on the two assault
charges, for which the jury remained empaneled.   [HN6] Double-jeopardy analysis
focuses on the individual ""offence"" charged, U.S. Const., Amdt. 5, and our cases
establish that jeopardy may terminate on some counts even as it continues on
others.  See, e.g.,  Price v. Georgia, 398 U.S. 323, 329, 26 L. Ed. 2d 300, 90
S. Ct. 1757 (1970).

[***LEdHR5A]  The dissent emphasizes that the acquittal was reconsidered ""before
the court of first instance ha[d] disassociated itself from the case or any
issue in it,"" whereas in  Smalis v. Pennsylvania, 476 U.S. 140, 90 L. Ed. 2d
116, 106 S. Ct. 1745 (1986), the government sought reconsideration by appealing.
Post, at 477-478, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 929 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.).  That
distinction is not a relevant one.  Smalis squarely held, not that further
factfinding proceedings were barred because there had been an appeal, but that
appeal was barred because further factfinding proceedings before the trial judge
(the factfinder who had pronounced the acquittal) were impermissible.   476
U.S., at 145, 90 L. Ed. 2d 116, 106 S. Ct. 1745.  Likewise, we recognized in
Justices of Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon, 466 U.S. 294, 80 L. Ed. 2d 311, 104
S. Ct. 1805 (1984), that in a ""two-tier"" trial system amounting to ""'a single,
continuous course of judicial proceedings,'"" acquittal at the first stage cannot
be reconsidered later in the two-tier process.   Id., at 309, 312, 80 L. Ed. 2d
311, 104 S. Ct. 1805.  These cases establish that an acquittal, once final, may
not be reconsidered on appeal or otherwise.

[***LEdHR6A]  The dissent misses the point of  Swisher v. Brady, 438 U.S. 204,
57 L. Ed. 2d 705, 98 S. Ct. 2699 (1978), which found no double-jeopardy bar to a
judge's review of a master's findings.  This was not a ""recogni[tion of] the
distinction between appeals and continuing proceedings before the initial
tribunal,"" post, at 478, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 929, but rather a recognition that
the initial jeopardy does not end until there is a final decision.  See  438
U.S., at 216, 57 L. Ed. 2d 705, 98 S. Ct. 2699 (""[I]t is for the State, not the
parties, to designate and empower the factfinder and adjudicator.  And here
Maryland has conferred those roles only on the Juvenile Court judge.  Thus,
regardless of which party is initially favored by the master's proposals, . . .
the judge is empowered to accept, modify, or reject those proposals"").  The
dissent is quite right that the taking of an appeal ""necessarily signals"" the
finality of the order appealed, post, at 477, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 929-930; that
does not establish, however, that the absence of an appeal necessarily connotes
the nonfinality that differentiates the master's finding in Swisher from the
midtrial acquittal in this case.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR7] [7]  [*470]  It is important to note, at the
outset, that the facts of this case gave petitioner no reason to doubt the
finality of the state court's ruling.  The prosecutor did not make or reserve a
motion for reconsideration, or seek a continuance that would allow him to
provide the court with favorable authority.  Rather, the sidebar conference
concluded, the court asked the prosecutor if he had ""any further evidence,"" and
he replied, ""No. At this point, the Commonwealth rests their case.""  [**1136]
App. 22.  Nor did the court's ruling appear on its face to be tentative.  The
trial court was not permitted by Massachusetts procedure to defer ruling on
petitioner's motion, Mass. Rule Crim. Proc. 25(a), or to require the defendants
to go forward with their cases while the prosecution reserved the right to
present more evidence,  Commonwealth v. Cote, 15 Mass. App. 229, 242, 444 N.E.2d
1282, 1290-1291 (1983).  And when the prosecutor suggested that he be given a
chance to reopen his case before the defendants  [***925]  proceeded, the court
rejected the suggestion because it was time to rule on petitioner's motion.
App. 22; n 1, supra.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR8A]  Was this apparently final ruling in fact final?  We
think,  and petitioner does not dispute, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 5, that  [HN7] as
a general matter state law may prescribe that a judge's midtrial determination
of the sufficiency of the State's proof can be reconsidered. Cf.  Pennsylvania
v. Goldhammer, 474 U.S. 28, 30, 88 L. Ed. 2d 183, 106 S. Ct. 353 (1985) (per
curiam) (state law regarding appealability may affect defendant's expectation
that a sentence is final for double-jeopardy purposes).  We can find no instance
in which a State has done this by statute or rule, but some  [*471]  state
courts have held, as a matter of common law or in the exercise of their
supervisory power, that a court-directed judgment of acquittal is not effective
until it is signed and entered in the docket,  Harden v. State, 160 Ga. App.
514, 515, 287 S. E. 2d 329, 331 (1981), until a formal order is issued,  State
v. Collins, 112 Wn. 2d 303, 308-309, 771 P.2d 350, 353 (1989), or until the
motion hearing is concluded,  Watson v. State, 410 So. 2d 207, 209 (Fla. App.
1982).

At the time of petitioner's trial, however, Massachusetts had not adopted any
such rule of nonfinality.   [HN8] Its Rules of Criminal Procedure provided that
only clerical errors in a judgment or order, or errors ""arising from oversight
or omission,"" were subject to correction at any time.  Mass. Rule Crim. Proc. 42
(2002).  Massachusetts cites a few commonwealth cases supporting the general
proposition that interlocutory rulings (rulings on pretrial motions, evidentiary
rulings, and the like) are subject to reconsideration. But it is far from
obvious that this principle extends to entry of a required finding of not guilty
under Rule 25 (or to its common-law predecessor, the directed verdict)--which on
its face, at least, purports not to be interlocutory but to end the case.  We
think much more was required here.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR8A]  It may suffice for an appellate court to announce
the state-law rule that midtrial acquittals are tentative in a case where
reconsideration of the acquittal occurred at a stage in the trial where the
defendant's justifiable ignorance of the rule could not possibly have caused him
prejudice. 5 But when, as here, the trial has proceeded to the defendant's
[*472]  presentation of his case, the possibility of prejudice arises.  The
seeming dismissal may induce a defendant to present a defense to the undismissed
charges when he would be better advised to stand silent.  Many jurisdictions
still follow the traditional rule that after trial [**1137]  or on appeal,
sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenges are reviewed on the basis of the entire
trial record, even if the defendant moved for acquittal when the prosecution
rested and the court erroneously denied that motion.  E.g., [***926]   Smith v.
State, 1973 OK CR 243, 509 P.2d 1391, 1397 (Okla. Crim. App. 1973);  Deal v.
State, 657 P.2d 404, 405 (Alaska App. 1983) (per curiam). See generally Comment,
The Motion for Acquittal: A Neglected Safeguard,  70 Yale L. J. 1151, 1152-1158
(1961).  In these jurisdictions, the defendant who puts on a case runs ""the risk
that . . . he will bolster the Government case enough for it to support a
verdict of guilty.""  McGautha v. California, 402 U.S. 183, 215, 28 L. Ed. 2d
711, 91 S. Ct. 1454 (1971).  The defendant's evidence ""may lay the foundation
for otherwise inadmissible evidence in the Government's initial presentation or
provide corroboration for essential elements of the Government's case.""  United
States v. Calderon, 348 U.S. 160, 164, n. 1, 99 L. Ed. 202, 75 S. Ct. 186,
1954-2 C.B. 230 (1954) (citation omitted).  In all jurisdictions, moreover,
false assurance of acquittal on one count may induce the defendant to present
defenses to the remaining counts that are inadvisable--for example, a defense
that entails admission of guilt on the acquitted count. 6

5 In  Price v. Vincent, 538 U.S. 634, 155 L. Ed. 2d 877, 123 S. Ct. 1848 (2003),
a habeas case presenting facts similar to those here, the judge granted a
partial acquittal but reconsidered before the trial proceeded, and the Michigan
courts concluded that no double-jeopardy violation had occurred.   Id., at
637-638, 155 L. Ed. 2d 877, 123 S. Ct. 1848.  We held that conclusion to be not
""an unreasonable application of . . . Federal law,"" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), in
part because, as the Michigan Supreme Court observed, ""no trial proceedings took
place with respondent laboring under the mistaken impression that he was not
facing the possibility of conviction for"" the purportedly acquitted charge.
538 U.S., at 642-643, 155 L. Ed. 2d 877, 123 S. Ct. 1848.

6  [***LEdHR8A]  In multiple-defendant cases like this one, an apparent final
dismissal of one defendant may also cause the others to alter their cases in
harmful ways.  They would, for example, proceed under the mistaken belief that
they need no longer fear the acquitted defendant's assertion of a defense
antagonistic to their own, and might assume that the acquitted defendant would
become available as a defense witness.  Cf.  Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14,
22-23, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019, 87 S. Ct. 1920 (1967) (discussing reasons to allow
testimony of a purported accomplice after accomplice's acquittal).  While the
potential effect upon codefendants has no bearing upon this petitioner's
double-jeopardy claim, it does confirm the wisdom of the rule we adopt.

  [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR8A]   [***LEdHR9A]   [*473]  The Double Jeopardy
Clause's guarantee cannot be allowed to become a potential snare for those who
reasonably rely upon it.   [HN9] If, after a facially unqualified midtrial
dismissal of one count, the trial has proceeded to the defendant's introduction
of evidence, the acquittal must be treated as final, unless the availability of
reconsideration has been plainly established by pre-existing rule or case
authority expressly applicable to midtrial rulings on the sufficiency of the
evidence.  That requirement was not met here.  The Commonwealth has failed to
show that under state procedure as it existed at the time of petitioner's trial,
the trial court's ruling on the motion for a required finding of not guilty was
automatically, or even presumptively, nonfinal.  At most it has shown that the
ruling was wrong because the Commonwealth's evidence was, as a matter of law,
sufficient--a point that the dissent emphasizes, echoing the opinion below.  See
post, at 476-477, 479, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 928, 929, 930.  But  [HN10] any
contention that the Double Jeopardy Clause must itself (even absent provision by
the State) leave open a way of correcting legal errors is at odds with the well
established rule that the bar will attach to a preverdict acquittal that is
patently wrong in law.  See, e.g.,  Smalis, 476 U.S., at 144, n. 7, 90 L. Ed. 2d
116, 106 S. Ct. 1745;  Sanabria, 437 U.S., at 68-69, 75, 78, 57 L. Ed. 2d 43, 98
S. Ct. 2170;  Martin Linen, 430 U.S., at 571, 51 L. Ed. 2d 642, 97 S. Ct. 1349;

7  [***LEdHR9A]  The dissent goes to great lengths to establish that there was
no prejudice here, since the acquittal was legally wrong, and the defendant was
deprived of no available defense.  See post, at 476-480, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at
928-929, 930-931.  But the Double Jeopardy Clause has never required prejudice
beyond the very exposure to a second jeopardy. To put it differently:  [HN11]
Requiring someone to defend against a charge of which he has already been
acquitted is prejudice per se for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause --even
when the acquittal was erroneous because the evidence was sufficient.  See,
e.g.,  Sanabria v. United States, 437 U.S. 54, 77-78, 57 L. Ed. 2d 43, 98 S. Ct.
2170 (1978).  Of course it is not even clear that the dissent's due-process
analysis would acknowledge prejudice when a midtrial acquittal was correct when
rendered, so long as evidence sufficient to sustain the charge was eventually
introduced (after the acquittal and during the defendant's case, see supra, at
472, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 925-926).  Our double-jeopardy cases make clear that an
acquittal bars the prosecution from seeking ""another opportunity to supply
evidence which it failed to muster"" before jeopardy terminated.   Burks v.
United States, 437 U.S. 1, 11, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1, 98 S. Ct. 2141 (1978).

  [***927]   [**1138]   [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR8A]   [*474]  Massachusetts
argues that if the Double Jeopardy Clause does not allow for reconsideration,
every erroneous grant of a directed-verdict motion will be unremediable, even
one attributable to mistaken expression that is promptly corrected.  We think
not.  Double-jeopardy principles have never been thought to bar the immediate
repair of a genuine error in the announcement of an acquittal, even one rendered
by a jury.  See M. Friedland, Double Jeopardy 61 (1969); King v Parkin, 1 Mood.
45, 46-47, 168 Eng. Rep. 1179, 1180 (1824). And of course States can protect
themselves still further against the ""occasional errors"" of law that the dissent
thinks ""inevitabl[e]"" in the course of trial, post, at 478, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at
929, by rendering midtrial acquittals nonfinal.  (Massachusetts, as we have
observed, has specifically provided for the correction of mistaken utterances or
scrivener's errors, but not for the reconsideration of legal conclusions.  See
Mass. Rule Crim. Proc. 42 (2002).)

Prosecutors are not without protection against ill-considered acquittal rulings.
States can and do craft procedural rules that allow trial judges ""the maximum
opportunity to consider with care a pending acquittal motion,""  Martin Linen,
supra, at 574, 51 L. Ed. 2d 642, 97 S. Ct. 1349, including the option of
deferring consideration until after the verdict.  See, e.g., D. C. Super. Ct.
Crim. Proc. Rule 29(b) (2003); N. Y. Crim. Proc. Law Ann. § 290.10(1)(b) (West
2002); W. Va. Rule Crim. Proc. 29(b) (2004).  (At least one State has altogether
precluded midtrial acquittals by the court.  See Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. §
175.381(1) (2001).) Moreover, a prosecutor can seek to persuade the court to
correct its legal error before it rules, or at least before the proceedings move
forward.  See  Price v. Vincent, 538 U.S., at 637-638, 642-643, 155 L. Ed. 2d
877, 123 S. Ct. 1848.  Indeed, the prosecutor in this case convinced the judge
to reconsider her acquittal ruling on the basis of legal authority he had
obtained during a 15-minute recess before closing arguments.   [*475]  See App.
71-72, 74.  Had he sought a short continuance at the time of the acquittal
motion, the matter could have been resolved satisfactorily before petitioner
went forward with his case.

DISSENT BY: GINSBURG

DISSENT

 Justice Ginsburg, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Kennedy, and Justice
Breyer join, dissenting.

Does the Double Jeopardy Clause  [***928]  bar the States from allowing trial
judges to reconsider a midtrial grant of a motion to acquit on one or more but
fewer than all counts of an indictment? The Court unanimously answers ""No."" See
ante, at 470, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 924-925 (""[A]s a general matter state law may
prescribe that a judge's midtrial determination of the sufficiency of the
State's proof can be reconsidered."").  A State may provide for such
reconsideration, the Court also recognizes, by legislation or by judicial
[**1139]  rule, common-law decision, or exercise of supervisory power.  See ante
, at 470-471, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 925.  According to the Appeals Court of
Massachusetts, the Commonwealth has so provided through its decisional law.   58
Mass. App. 166, 171, 788 N.E.2d 977, 983 (2003); see  Commonwealth v. Haskell,
438 Mass. 790, 792, 784 N.E.2d 625, 628 (2003) (""A judge's power to reconsider
his own decisions during the pendency of a case is firmly rooted in the common
law . . . ."").  The view held by the Massachusetts court on this issue is hardly
novel.  See, e.g.,  United States v. LoRusso, 695 F.2d 45, 53 (CA2 1982) (""A
district court has the inherent power to reconsider and modify its interlocutory
orders prior to the entry of judgment . . . .""); cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 54(b)
(Absent ""entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the
claims or parties,"" ""any order or other form of decision, however designated,
which adjudicates fewer  [*476]  than all the claims or the rights and
liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to
any of the claims or parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject
to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims
and the rights and liabilities of all the parties."").

Nevertheless, the trial court here was locked into its on-the-spot error, the
Court maintains, because ""the availability of reconsideration [had not] been
plainly established by pre-existing rule or case authority expressly applicable
to midtrial rulings on the sufficiency of the evidence."" Ante, at 473, 160 L.
Ed. 2d, at 926.  Otherwise, according to the Court, ""[t]he Double Jeopardy
Clause's guarantee [would] become a potential snare for those who reasonably
rely upon it."" Ibid.

I agree that, as a trial unfolds, a defendant must be accorded a timely, fully
informed opportunity to meet the State's charges.  I would so hold as a matter
not of double jeopardy, but of due process.  See  Gray v. Netherland, 518 U.S.
152, 171, 135 L. Ed. 2d 457, 116 S. Ct. 2074 (1996) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting)
(""Basic to due process in criminal proceedings is the right to a full, fair,
potentially effective opportunity to defend against the State's charges."").  On
the facts presented here, however, as the Massachusetts Appeals Court observed,
see  58 Mass. App., at 171, 788 N. E. 2d, at 983, defendant-petitioner Smith
suffered no prejudice fairly attributable to the trial court's error.

The trial judge in Smith's case acted impatiently and made a mistake at the
close of the Commonwealth's case.  Cutting short the prosecutor's objections,
see App. 2"
"              MID-CON FREIGHT SYSTEMS, INC., et al., Petitioners v.                    MICHIGAN PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, et al.",545 U.S. 440,"

 [*442]  [**2429]   Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case concerns pre-emption.  [HN1] A Michigan law imposes ""an annual fee of
$100.00"" upon each Michigan license-plated truck that is ""operating entirely in
interstate commerce."" Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 478.2(2) (West 2002) (hereinafter
MCL).   [HN2] A federal statute states that ""a State registration requirement .
. . is an unreasonable burden"" upon interstate commerce when it imposes so high
a fee.  49 U.S.C. § 14504(b) (emphasis added); see also [**2430]  §
14504(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III).  Does this federal statutory provision pre-empt the
Michigan law?  We conclude that  [HN3] the Michigan fee requirement is not the
kind of ""State registration requirement"" to which the federal statute refers.
And for that reason, the statute does not pre-empt it.

I

[HN4] Federal law has long required most motor carriers doing interstate
business to obtain a permit--which we shall call a Federal Permit--that reflects
compliance with certain federal requirements.  See 49 U.S.C. § 13901 et seq.; 49
CFR § 365.101 et seq. (2004).  In 1965, Congress authorized States to require
proof that the operator of an interstate truck had secured a Federal Permit.  49
U.S.C. § 302(b)(2) (1976 ed.);  [*443]  see generally Yellow Transp., Inc. v.
Michigan, 537 U.S. 36, 39, 154 L. Ed. 2d 377, 123 S. Ct. 371 (2002).  By 1991,
39 States demanded such proof by requiring some form of what we shall call State
Registration (of the Federal Permit).  Those States typically would require
truckers to file with a state agency evidence that each interstate truck was
covered by a Federal Permit.  They would require the trucker to pay a State
Registration fee of up to $10 per truck. And they would issue a State
Registration stamp that the trucker would affix to a multistate ""bingo card""
carried within the vehicle.  See 49 CFR §§ 1023.32, 1023.33 (1990); Yellow
Transp., 537 U.S., at 39, 154 L. Ed. 2d 377, 123 S. Ct. 371.

In 1991, Congress focused upon the fact that the ""bingo card"" system required a
trucking company to obtain  [***423]  a separate stamp from each State through
which an interstate truck traveled.  It found this scheme inefficient and
burdensome.  See id., at 39-40, 154 L. Ed. 2d 377, 123 S. Ct. 371.  And it
enacted a statute setting forth a new system, the Single State Registration
System (SSRS), which remains in effect today.  Intermodal Surface Transportation
Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), 49 U.S.C. § 14504.   [HN5] The SSRS allows a
trucking company to fill out one set of forms in one State (the base State), and
by doing so to register its Federal Permit in every participating State through
which its trucks will travel.  § 14504(c); 49 CFR § 367.4(b) (2004).

[HN6] The SSRS statute says that the base State can demand: (1) proof of the
trucking company's possession of a Federal Permit, (2) proof of insurance, (3)
the name of an agent designated to receive ""service of process,"" and (4) a total
fee (charged for the filing of the proof of insurance) equal to the sum of the
individual state fees.  49 U.S.C. §§ 14504(c)(2)(A)(i)-(iv); 49 CFR §§
367.4(c)(1)-(4) (2004).  Each individual state fee, it adds, cannot exceed the
amount the State charged under the ""bingo card"" system, and in no event can it
exceed $10 per truck. 49 U.S.C. § 14504(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III).  After a truck owner
registers, base state officials provide the owner with a receipt to be kept in
the cab  [*444]  of each registered truck. 49 CFR §§ 367.5(a), (b), (e) (2004).
The base State distributes to each participating State its share of the total
registration fee. § 367.6(a).

[HN7] The SSRS statute specifies that a State may not impose any additional
""registration requirement."" It states specifically, in the statutory sentence at
issue here, that when a State Registration requirement imposes further
obligations, ""the part in excess is an unreasonable burden."" 49 U.S.C. §
14504(b).  It adds that a State may not require ""decals, stamps, cab cards, or
any other means of registering . .  . specific vehicles."" § 14504(c)(2)(B)(iii).
And it provides that the ""charging or collection of any fee under this section
that is [**2431]  not in accordance with the fee system established [in this
provision] shall be deemed to be a burden on interstate commerce."" §
14504(c)(2)(C).  At the same time, the statute makes clear that a State that
complies with the SSRS system need not fear Commerce Clause attack, for it says
that a state requirement that an interstate truck ""must register with the State""
is ""not an unreasonable burden on transportation,"" provided that ""the State
registration is completed"" in accordance with the SSRS statute.  § 14504(b).

B

The state law at issue here, § 478.2(2) of the Michigan Motor Carrier Act, reads
as follows:


      [HN8] ""A motor carrier licensed in this state shall pay an annual fee
     of $100.00 for each vehicle operated by the motor carrier which is
     registered in this state [i.e., which has a Michigan license plate]
     and operating entirely in interstate commerce.""


 [HN9]

Related state rules and regulations require a carrier paying the $100 fee to
identify each interstate truck by make, type, year, serial number, and unit
number.  See Equipment List Form P-344-T, App. to Defendant's Response to
Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Disposition in No. 95-15628-CM  [***424]  etc.
[*445]  (Mich. Ct. Cl.) (hereinafter Equipment List Form P-344-T).  They also
make clear that, upon payment of the fee, the carrier will receive a decal that
must be affixed to the truck. App. 24 (Affidavit of Pub. Serv. Comm'n. official
Thomas R. Lonergan).  And they provide that a carrier who pays this fee need not
pay the $10 SSRS registration fee if the carrier chooses Michigan as its SSRS
base State.  See, e.g., id., at 67, n; Westlake Transp., Inc. v. Michigan Pub.
Serv. Comm'n, 255 Mich. App. 589, 603-604, n. 6, 662 N.W.2d 784, 790-792, n. 6
(2003); Reply Brief for Petitioners 14-15, n 8.

C

Petitioners are interstate trucking companies with trucks that bear Michigan
license plates and operate entirely in interstate commerce. Hence they are
subject to Michigan's $100 fee.  MCL § 478.2(2) (West 2002).  They asked a
Michigan court to invalidate § 478.2(2) as pre-empted by the federal SSRS
statute.  255 Mich. App., at 592, 662 N. W. 2d, at 789-790.  The Michigan Court
of Claims rejected their claim.  Id., at 593-594, 662 N. W. 2d, at 789-790. And
the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed.  Id., at 604, 662 N. W. 2d, at 795.

The Court of Appeals wrote that the $100 fee is a ""regulatory fee""--a ""fee
imposed for the administration"" of the State's Motor Carrier Act and for
enforcement of Michigan ""safety regulations."" Ibid. As such, it falls outside
the scope of the term ""registration requirement"" as used in the federal SSRS
statute, 49 U.S.C. § 14504(b).  255 Mich. App., at 604, 662 N. W. 2d, at 795.
The federal statute, according to the Michigan court, consequently does not
pre-empt it.  Ibid.

Petitioners sought leave to appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court; leave was
denied.  Westlake Transp., Inc. v. Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 469 Mich. 976,
673 N.W.2d 752 (2003).  We granted their petition for certiorari and
consolidated the case with  Am. Trucking Ass'ns v. [*446]  Michigan Pub. Serv.
Comm'n, ante, p. 429, 162 L. Ed. 2d 407, 125 S. Ct. 2419, 2005 U.S. LEXIS 4843a
case in which interstate truckers sought review of a separate Michigan fee.  We
now affirm the Michigan court's judgment in this case, though for other reasons.

[**2432]  II

A

The first legal question before us concerns the meaning of the federal statutory
words ""State registration requirement."" They appear in a subsection that reads
in relevant part as follows:


      [HN10] ""The requirement of a State that a motor carrier, providing
     [interstate transportation] in that State, must register with the
     State is not an unreasonable burden on transportation . . . when the
     State registration is completed under standards of the Secretary [of
     Transportation] under subsection (c).  When a State registration
     requirement imposes obligations in excess of the standards of the
     Secretary, the part in excess is an unreasonable burden."" 49 U.S.C. §
     14504(b) (emphasis added).



What is the scope of the italicized words?

Petitioners ask us to give these words a broad interpretation, sweeping within
their ambit every state requirement involving some form of  [***425]
individualized registration that affects an interstate motor carrier. Brief for
Petitioners 15 (federal statute's limits apply ""to all interstate motor carriers
compelled to register their operations with any State regulatory commission
under any State law"" (emphasis in original)).  The United States argues for a
somewhat narrower interpretation,  submitting that the words apply to ""state
registration requirements that are imposed on interstate carriers by reason of
their operation in interstate commerce."" Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 19-20 (emphasis in original).  In our view, however, the language, read
in context, is yet more narrow.

[*447]   [HN11] Reference to text, historical context, and purpose discloses
that the words ""State registration requirement"" do not apply to every State
Registration requirement that happens to cover interstate carriers, nor to every
such requirement specifically focused on a trucking operation's interstate
character.  Rather, they apply only to those state requirements that concern
SSRS registration--that is, registration with a State of evidence that a carrier
possesses a Federal Permit, registration of proof of insurance, or registration
of the name of an agent ""for service of process."" § 14504(c)(2)(A)(iv).  Thus,
the federal provision pre-empts only those state requirements that (1) concern
the subject matter of the SSRS and (2) are ""in excess"" of the requirements that
the SSRS imposes in respect to that subject matter. See § 14504(b).

To begin with, statutory language makes clear that the federal provision reaches
no further.   [HN12] Section 14504(b)'s first sentence says that a state
""requirement"" that an interstate motor carrier must ""register with the State is
not an unreasonable burden . . . when the State registration is completed under
standards of the Secretary under subsection (c)."" Ibid. It is clear from the
text as a whole that ""State registration"" cannot cover all registration
requirements, but only some.  Cf. post, at 464-465, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 435-436
(Kennedy, J., dissenting).  The first sentence's reference to the ""standards of
the Secretary"" (as well as the focus of the entire statute) tells us which.
Those ""standards,"" set forth in subsection (c) --which is titled ""Single State
Registration System""--exclusively relate to State Registration of ""evidence of""
a Federal Permit, ""proof of"" insurance, and the ""name of a local agent for
service of process,"" and state fees ""for the filing of proof of insurance."" §§
14504(c)(2)(A)(i)-(iv); § 14504(c)(2)(B)(iv).  And the rest of the statute
similarly deals exclusively with SSRS matters.  See § 14504(a) (""standards"" mean
""the specification of forms and procedures required"" to prove that a [**2433]
motor carrier is in compliance with federal requirements).  Thus, the words
""State registration"" in the pre-emption provision's first sentence  [*448]
refer only to state systems that seek evidence that a trucker has complied with
specific, federally enumerated, SSRS obligations.  Cf. 49 U.S.C. § 13908(d) (§
14504's fees relate specifically to state efforts to obtain proof of insurance
under the SSRS); §§ 13908(b)(2)-(3) (indicating that § 14504 refers to state
requirements having this purpose).

How could the same words in the second sentence refer to something totally
different?  We have found no language here or elsewhere in the  [***426]
statute (which we reproduce in the Appendix, infra) suggesting that the term
""State registration requirement"" in sentence two refers to all State
Registration requirements ""imposed on interstate carriers by reason of their
operation in interstate commerce."" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20
(emphasis in original).  Indeed, to read the words ""by reason of . . ."" into §
14504, a linguistic stretch, would be wholly inconsistent with the statute's
basic purposes, because it would leave a State free to implement a regulation in
excess of specific SSRS limitations as long as it did not single out interstate
carriers (say, a neutral rule that all truckers must pay $50, or $500, per truck
for proof of insurance, or must designate multiple agents for service of
process).  See post, at 463, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 435 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).

To avoid this severely incongruous result, the dissent (which adopts the
Government's view) must resort to interpretive acrobatics.  After first reading
subsection (b) to say that a neutral base state requirement, despite being ""in
excess"" of SSRS standards, is not an ""unreasonable burden on"" commerce, it then
reads subsection (c) to say that such a requirement, because it is ""in excess""
of SSRS standards, is nonetheless prohibited by the statute (in effect, an
unreasonable burden on commerce).  Post, at 466-468, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 437-438.
Aside from imposing significant complexities on the statute where otherwise none
would exist, this reading stretches subsection (c)'s function beyond that which
its structure and language will allow.

[*449]  Similarly, we see no language elsewhere in the statute suggesting that
the term ""State registration requirement"" refers to any kind of State
Registration whatsoever that might affect interstate carriers.  And even the
Government concedes that certain registration obligations--those in ""traditional
areas of state regulation""--are beyond the pre-emptive reach of the statute.
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19.  Finally, the implementing
regulations do not support these broader constructions.  See 49 CFR § 367.1 et
seq. (2004).

Our reading of the text finds confirmation in historical context.  Congress
enacted § 14504 to simplify the old ""bingo card"" system.  See Yellow Transp.,
537 U.S., at 39-40, 154 L. Ed. 2d 377, 123 S. Ct. 371.  Under the ""bingo card""
scheme, each State could independently demand the same separate filings
(evidence of a Federal Permit, proof of insurance, and a service-of-process
agent) as well as separate fees.  49 U.S.C. § 302(b)(2) (1976 ed.); § 11506
(1988 ed.); 49 CFR §§ 1023.11, 1023.21, 1023.32, 1023.51 (1990).  Federal law
governing that scheme placed no express constraints on any state filings or fees
other than those concerning Federal Permit and insurance requirements.  Indeed,
federal regulations specified that the federal ""bingo card"" statute did not
""affect"" the ""collection or [the] method of collection of taxes or fees by a
State"" from interstate truckers ""for the operation of vehicles within"" its
""borders."" § 1023.104.  And they further provided that the statute did not
""affect"" state requirements ""as to the external [**2434]  identification of
vehicles to indicate the payment of a State tax or fee imposed for revenue
purposes or for any other purpose"" not governed by the ""bingo card"" system.  §
1023.42.

[***427]  When Congress created the new SSRS, it did not indicate (in the text,
structure, or divinable purpose of the new provision) that the pre-emptive scope
of the new scheme would be any broader than that of the old.  See ISTEA, 105
Stat. 1914, 102-240.  The relevant differences between the SSRS and the  [*450]
""bingo card"" regime were that: (1) one State, rather than many, would collect
the relevant filings; (2) one State, rather than many, would collect the
relevant fees; and (3) these fees, limited to the same amount as before, would
relate to filing of proof of insurance rather than to filing of the Federal
Permit.  Compare 49 U.S.C. § 11506 (1988 ed.) with § 14504 (2000 ed.); see also
§ 11506 (1988 ed., Supp. IV).  These modifications merely sought more efficient,
not greater, federal regulation. See  Yellow Transp., supra see also 49 U.S.C.
§§ 13908(a), (d) (authorizing the Secretary to replace the SSRS with a yet more
streamlined system and pre-empting only those State ""insurance filing
requirements or fees that are for the same purposes as filings or fees the
Secretary requires under the new system"" (emphasis added)).  And  [HN13] while
the new regulations implementing the SSRS do not explicitly exempt unrelated
state requirements from the statute's pre-emptive reach, neither they nor the
rulemaking that produced them suggest any change to pre-existing practice in
this respect.  See 49 CFR § 367.1 et seq. (2004); see also Single State
Insurance Registration, 9 I.C.C.2d 609 (1993) (Interstate Commerce Commission
decision announcing new regulations); Single State Insurance Registration, No.
MC-100 (Sub-No. 6), 1993 WL 17833 (I. C. C., Jan. 13, 1993) (proposing
regulations, providing justifications, and soliciting further comments).

Finally, we have found nothing in the statute's basic purposes or
objectives--improving the efficiency of the ""bingo card"" system and simplifying
a uniform scheme for providing States with certain vital information--that
either requires a broader reading of the statutory term, or that impliedly
pre-empts other, non-SSRS-related state rules.  Cf. Geier v. American Honda
Motor Co., 529 U.S. 861, 881, 146 L. Ed. 2d 914, 120 S. Ct. 1913 (2000) (federal
statutes by implication pre-empt state law that stands ""as an obstacle to the
accomplishment and execution"" of their federal objectives (internal quotation
marks omitted)).   [*451]  That is, we can find no indication that Congress
sought to use this narrowly focused statute to forbid state fee or registration
obligations that have nothing to do with basic SSRS (or earlier ""bingo card"")
objectives--say, for example, a State Registration requirement related to
compliance by interstate carriers with rules governing the introduction of
foreign pests into the jurisdiction, or with a State's version of the Amber
Alert system, or with size, weight, and safety standards.  The Constitution's
Commerce Clause may (or may not) forbid some such rules.  But this
statute--which identifies and regulates very specific items--says nothing about
them, and there is no reason to believe that Congress wished to resolve that
kind of Commerce Clause issue in this provision.  Cf. 49 U.S.C. § 13908
(indicating that the SSRS may well be only a temporary system and similarly
focusing on limited, federally enumerated requirements without discussing broad
pre-emption).

We conclude, as we have said, that  [HN14]  [***428]  the term ""State
registration requirement,"" as used in the second sentence of the SSRS statute,
covers only those State Registration requirements that concern the subject
[**2435]  matter of that statutory provision, namely, the registration of a
Federal Permit, proof of insurance, and the name of an agent for service of
process. See supra, at 446-447, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 424-425.  It neither
explicitly nor implicitly reaches unrelated matters.

B

The second legal question involves the Michigan statute imposing the $100 fee on
Michigan-plated trucks operating entirely in interstate commerce. MCL § 478.2(2)
(West 2002).  Do the requirements set forth in that statute concern the SSRS
statute's subject matter? We think that they do not.

For one thing,  [HN15] the Michigan statute imposing the $100 fee makes no
reference to evidence of a Federal Permit, to any insurance requirement, or to
an agent for receiving service  [*452]  of process. Nor, as far as we can tell,
do any state rules related to the $100 fee require the filing of information
about these matters.  See Equipment List Form P-344-T (requiring information
about truck make, type, year, unit number, and serial number).

For another thing, Michigan law imposed a separate fee on interstate motor
carriers with trucks license plated in Michigan before the SSRS existed and
before Michigan began to participate in the ""bingo card"" system.  See App.
24-25; Plaintiffs' Second Motion for Partial Summary Disposition in No.
95-15628-CM etc. (Mich. Ct. Cl.), p 5; Plaintiffs-Appellants' Brief on Appeal,
in No. 226052 etc. (Mich. Ct. App.), pp 5-6; MCL § 478.7(4) (West 2002).  Hence
such a fee does not represent an effort somehow to circumvent the limitations
imposed in connection with federal laws governing State Registration of Federal
Permits.

Finally,  [HN16] Michigan rules provide that a Michigan-plated interstate truck
choosing Michigan as its SSRS base State can apparently comply with Michigan's
SSRS requirements even if it does not comply with Michigan's $100 fee
requirement.  The owner of that truck can fill out Michigan form RS-1, thereby
providing Michigan with evidence that it has a Federal Permit.  App. 65-66.  It
can also fill out form RS-2, on which it indicates the total SSRS fees it owes
to all participating States whose borders the truck will cross.  Id., at 67.
Upon submission of the two forms and payment of the fees, Michigan apparently
will give the owner form RS-3, an SSRS receipt, a copy of which the owner can
place in the vehicle of the truck, thereby complying with Michigan's (and all
other participating States') SSRS-related ""State registration requirements."" If
that owner fails to pay Michigan's $100 fee for that truck, the owner will not
receive a state fee decal. But that owner will have violated only Michigan's
$100 fee statute here at issue, MCL § 478.2(2) (West 2002).  Petitioners have
provided us with nothing that suggests the  [*453]  owner will have violated any
other provision of Michigan law.  See § 478.7(4).  And they have not
demonstrated that Michigan law in practice holds hostage a truck owner's SSRS
compliance until the owner pays § 478.2(2)'s $100 fee.

On the other hand, we recognize that Michigan form RS-2, the form  [***429]
that lists all SSRS-participating States together with their SSRS-related fees,
places an asterisk next to Michigan and states that ""[v]ehicles base-plated in
Michigan need not"" pay any SSRS fee but ""are required to have a $100.00""
Michigan decal. App. 67.  Michigan thereby forgives Michigan-plated interstate
trucks (which must pay Michigan $100) payment of the $10 Michigan SSRS fee that
would otherwise be due.  And to that extent, there is a connection between the
$100 fee and the SSRS.

Michigan appears to forgive its $10 SSRS fee, however, only for the
Michigan-plated [**2436]  interstate trucks of a carrier that has chosen
Michigan as its SSRS ""base"" State.  See Reply Brief for Petitioners 14-15, n 8.
Michigan-plated trucks operating out of a different SSRS base State, say, Ohio,
must pay the fee, which is remitted back to Michigan.  Thus, the $10 reduction
can be seen simply as an effort to provide modest, administratively efficient
(because Michigan itself is handling both fees) recompense to those motor
carriers that operate Michigan-plated trucks and choose Michigan as their SSRS
base State.  That subsidiary connection cannot transform Michigan's $100 fee,
which exclusively involves non-SSRS subject matter (and was created for
non-SSRS-related reasons), into a requirement that concerns the subject matter
of the SSRS statute.


     * * *



For these reasons, we conclude that  [HN17] 49 U.S.C. § 14504(b) does not
pre-empt Michigan's $100 fee.  The judgment of the Michigan Court of Appeals is
affirmed.

It is so ordered.


      [*454]  APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT

     referred to in section 13501 when the State registration is completed

DISSENT BY: KENNEDY

DISSENT

Justice Kennedy, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice O'Connor join,
dissenting.

The Michigan Court of Appeals, in my view, erred in holding that Mich. Comp.
Laws Ann. § 478.2(2) (West 2002) (hereinafter MCL) is not a registration
requirement.  Westlake Transp., Inc. v. Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 255 Mich.
App. 589, 603-605, 662 N.W.2d 784, 795 (2003).  Our Court, too, errs by
concluding that the term ""State registration requirement"" in 49 U.S.C. §
14504(b) includes only those state registration requirements that ""concern the
[same] subject matter"" as the Single State Registration System (SSRS)
established by § 14504(c).  Ante, at 447, 451, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 425, 427-428.
This respectful dissent explains my reasons for rejecting these two holdings.

[*457]  I

Title 49 U.S.C. § 14504(b) provides:


     ""The requirement of a State that a motor carrier, providing
     [interstate transportation] in that State, must register with the
     State is not an unreasonable burden on transportation"
"               MARLON LATODD HOWELL, aka MARLON COX, Petitioner v.                                   MISSISSIPPI",543 U.S. 440,"


 [*441] Per Curiam.

 [***LEdHR1A] [1A] [**857]  Petitioner Marlon Howell contends that the
Mississippi courts violated his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth
Amendments to the United States Constitution by refusing to require a jury
instruction about a lesser included offense in his  [***877]  capital case. He
did not, however, raise this claim in the Supreme Court of Mississippi, which
unsurprisingly did not address it.  As a result, we dismiss the writ of
certiorari as improvidently granted.

Petitioner was convicted and sentenced to death for killing Hugh David Pernell.
Shortly after 5 a.m. on May 15, 2000, Pernell was delivering newspapers from his
car when the occupants of another car motioned for him to stop.  The evidence at
trial indicated that, when both cars had pulled over, petitioner got out of the
trailing car and approached the driver's side of Pernell's car.  After a brief
conversation and perhaps some kind of scuffle, petitioner pulled out a pistol,
shot Pernell through the heart, got back in the other car, and fled the scene.
See  860 So. 2d 704, 712-715, 738-739 (Miss. 2003).  At trial, petitioner argued
both that he was in another city at the time of the killing and that the
evidence was insufficient to prove that Pernell was killed during an attempted
robbery (which would deprive the State of an element of capital murder).  As
part of his nonalibi defense, petitioner sought to supplement the State's
proposed jury instruction on capital murder with instructions on manslaughter
and simple murder. The trial court refused the additional instructions.  The
jury found petitioner guilty of capital murder and separately concluded that he
should be sentenced to death.

On appeal to the State Supreme Court, one of petitioner's 28 claims of error was
the trial court's failure ""to give the defendant an instruction on the offense
of simple murder or manslaughter."" App. 39.  In that argument, petitioner cited
three cases from the State Supreme Court about  [*442]  lesser-included-offense
instructions, and the only opinion whose original language he quoted was a
noncapital case. Ibid. (quoting, with modifications,  Conner v. State, 632 So.
2d 1239, 1254 (Miss. 1993) (a capital case), in turn quoting  McGowan v. State,
541 So. 2d 1027, 1028 (Miss. 1989) (a noncapital case), in turn quoting  Harper
v. State, 478 So. 2d 1017, 1021 (Miss. 1985) (a noncapital case)).  Petitioner
argued that, because the jury ""could have found and returned the lesser included
offense of simple murder or manslaughter,"" the failure to give instructions on
those offenses was ""error"" that left the jury no ""choice but either to turn
[him] loose or convict [**858]  him of [c]apital [m]urder."" App. 40.  In the
course of affirming petitioner's conviction and death sentence, the State
Supreme Court found that ""[t]he facts of this case clearly do not support or
warrant"" the instruction for manslaughter or simple murder.  860 So. 2d, at 744.
The court cited and quoted a prior noncapital decision, which construed a state
statute and concluded that an instruction should be refused if it would cause
the jury to ""'ignore the primary charge'"" or ""'if the evidence does not justify
submission of a lesser-included offense.'"" Ibid. (quoting  Presley v. State, 321
So. 2d 309, 310-311 (Miss. 1975)).  The court also cited  Grace v. State, 375
So. 2d 419 (Miss. 1979), an aggravated-assault case rejecting an instruction for
simple assault.

Petitioner sought certiorari from this Court, arguing that his death sentence is
unconstitutional under that rule of our capital jurisprudence set forth in  Beck
v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625, 638, 65 L. Ed. 2d 392, 100 S. Ct. 2382 (1980) (""[I]f
the unavailability  [***878]  of a lesser included offense instruction enhances
the risk of an unwarranted conviction, [the State] is constitutionally
prohibited from withdrawing that option from the jury in a capital case"").  See
Pet. for Cert. 5.  We granted certiorari, but asked the parties to address the
following additional question: ""'Was petitioner's federal constitutional claim
properly raised before the Mississippi Supreme Court for purposes of 28 U.S.C. §
1257 [28 USCS § 1257]?'""  542 U.S. ___, 542 U.S. 936, 159 L. Ed. 2d 811, 124 S.
Ct. 2908 (2004).  Our answer to that  [*443]  question prevents us from reaching
petitioner's constitutional claim.

[HN1] Congress has given this Court the power to review ""[f]inal judgments or
decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be
had . . . where any . . . right . . . is specially set up or claimed under the
Constitution or the treaties or statutes of . . . the United States."" 28 U.S.C.
§ 1257(a) [28 USCS § 1257(a)](emphasis added).  Under that statute and its
predecessors, this Court has almost unfailingly refused to consider any
federal-law challenge to a state-court decision unless the federal claim ""was
either addressed by or properly presented to the state court that rendered the
decision we have been asked to review.""  Adams v. Robertson, 520 U.S. 83, 86,
137 L. Ed. 2d 203, 117 S. Ct. 1028 (1997) (per curiam); see also  Illinois v.
Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 218, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527, 103 S. Ct. 2317 (1983) (tracing this
principle back to  Crowell v. Randell, 35 U.S. 368, 10 Pet. 368, 392, 9 L. Ed.
458 (1836), and  Owings v. Norwood's Lessee, 9 U.S. 344, 5 Cranch 344, 3 L. Ed.
120 (1809)).

Petitioner's brief in the State Supreme Court did not properly present his claim
as one arising under federal law. 1 In the relevant argument, he did not cite
the Constitution or even any cases directly construing it, much less any of this
Court's cases.  Instead, he argues that he presented his federal claim by citing
Harveston v. State, 493 So. 2d 365 (Miss. 1986), which cited (among other cases)
Fairchild v. State, 459 So. 2d 793 (Miss. 1984), which in turn cited Beck, but
only by way of acknowledging that Mississippi's general rule requiring
lesser-included-offense instructions ""takes on constitutional proportions"" in
capital cases.   459 So. 2d, at 800.  Assuming it constituted adequate briefing
of the federal question under state-law standards, petitioner's daisy
chain--which depends upon a case that was cited by one of the cases that was
cited by one of the cases that petitioner cited--is too lengthy [**859]  to meet
this Court's standards for  [*444]  proper presentation of a federal claim. 2 As
we recently explained  [***879]  in a slightly different context,  [HN2] ""[a]
litigant wishing to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the federal law
basis for his claim in a state-court petition or brief . . . by citing in
conjunction with the claim the federal source of law on which he relies or a
case deciding such a claim on federal grounds, or by simply labeling the claim
'federal.'""  Baldwin v. Reese, 541 U.S. 27, 32, 158 L. Ed. 2d 64, 124 S. Ct.
1347 (2004).  In the context of § 1257, the same steps toward clarity are just
as easy to take and are generally necessary to establish that a federal question
was properly presented to a state court.  Petitioner did none of these things.

 Petitioner also contends that he raised his federal claim by implication
because the state-law rule on which he relied was ""identical,"" Tr. of Oral Arg.
17, or ""virtually identical,"" Brief for Petitioner 17-18, to the constitutional
rule articulated in Beck. Assuming, without deciding, that identical standards
might overcome a petitioner's failure to identify his claim as federal,  [HN3]
Mississippi's rule regarding lesser-included-offense instructions is not
identical to Beck--or at least not identical to the Mississippi Supreme Court's
interpretation of Beck. Mississippi's rule applies even when the jury is not
choosing only between acquittal and death.  The Mississippi Supreme Court's
[*445] interpretation of Beck, on the other hand, holds that case inapplicable
where the jury has the additional option of life imprisonment, see Jackson v.
State, 684 So. 2d 1213, 1228 (1996) --a conclusion that finds some support in
our cases, see  Hopkins v. Reeves, 524 U.S. 88, 98, 141 L. Ed. 2d 76, 118 S. Ct.
1895 (1998) (""In Beck, the death penalty was automatically tied to conviction,
and Beck's jury was told that if it convicted the defendant of the charged
offense, it was required to impose the death penalty"");  Schad v. Arizona, 501
U.S. 624, 646, 115 L. Ed. 2d 555, 111 S. Ct. 2491 (1991) (""Our fundamental
concern in Beck was that a jury . . . might . . . vote for a capital conviction
if the only alternative was to set the defendant free with no punishment at
all"").  Moreover, unlike Beck, see  447 U.S. 625, at 638, n. 14, 65 L. Ed. 2d
392, 100 S. Ct. 2382, Mississippi's rule on lesser-included-offense instructions
applies in noncapital cases (as shown by the cases petitioner did cite).  Thus,
one opinion of the Mississippi Supreme Court appears to have treated a claim
under Beck as distinct from one arising under the Mississippi rule.  See  Goodin
v. State, 787 So. 2d 639, 656 (2001) (""Having found no [federal] constitutional
flaws in the jury instruction given, we must now determine whether our practice
entitles Goodin to a manslaughter instruction.  We have held that there must be
some evidentiary support to grant an instruction for manslaughter"").

[***LEdHR2] [2]  [**860]  Petitioner suggests that we need not treat his failure
to present his federal claim in state court as jurisdictional. Reply Brief for
Petitioner 4, and n 1.  Notwithstanding the long line of cases clearly stating
that the presentation requirement is jurisdictional, see, e.g.,  Exxon Corp. v.

 [**603] Per Curiam.

 [***LEdHR1A] [1A] In 1987, respondent Kenneth T. Richey was tried in Ohio for
aggravated murder committed in the course of a felony. Evidence showed that
respondent set fire to the apartment of his neighbor, Hope Collins, in an
attempt to kill his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend, who were  [***411]
spending the night together in the apartment below.  The intended victims
escaped unharmed, but Hope Collins' 2-year-old daughter  [*75]  Cynthia died in
the fire.  At trial, the State presented evidence of respondent's intent to kill
his ex-girlfriend and her boyfriend, but not of specific intent to kill Cynthia
Collins.  The State also offered expert forensic evidence to show that the fire
had been started deliberately.  Respondent did not contest this forensic
evidence at trial because his retained arson expert had reported that the
State's evidence conclusively established arson. Respondent was convicted of
aggravated felony murder on a theory of transferred intent and sentenced to
death.  His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, where he was
represented by new counsel.

[***LEdHR2A] [2A] Respondent sought postconviction relief in state court.  The
state trial court denied his request for an evidentiary hearing and denied
relief on all claims, and the state appellate court affirmed.  Respondent then
sought federal habeas relief.  The District Court permitted discovery on certain
issues, but ultimately denied all of respondent's claims.  The Sixth Circuit
reversed, holding that respondent was entitled to habeas relief on two
alternative grounds.  First, that transferred intent was not a permissible
theory for aggravated felony murder under Ohio law, and that the evidence of
direct intent was constitutionally insufficient to support conviction.  Second,
that the performance of respondent's trial counsel had been constitutionally
deficient under  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L.
Ed. 2d 674 (1984), in his retaining and mishandling of his arson expert and in
his inadequate treatment of the State's expert testimony.

We now grant the State's petition for writ of certiorari and vacate the judgment
below.

I

[***LEdHR1A] [1B] The Sixth Circuit erred in holding that  [HN1] the doctrine of
transferred intent was inapplicable to aggravated felony murder for the version
of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 2903.01(B) (Anderson 1982) under which respondent was
convicted.  [*76]  See  Richey v. Mitchell, 395 F.3d 660, 675 (2005).  The Ohio
Supreme Court's interpretation of that section, as announced in its review of
respondent's case, directly contradicts the Sixth Circuit's analysis:


     ""The fact that the intended victims escaped harm, and that an innocent
     child, Cynthia Collins, was killed instead, does not alter Richey's
     legal and moral responsibility.   [HN2] 'The doctrine of transferred
     intent is firmly rooted in Ohio law.' Very simply, 'the culpability of
     a scheme designed to implement the calculated decision to kill is not
     altered by the fact that the scheme is directed at someone other than
     the actual victim.'""  [**604]   State v. Richey, 64 Ohio St. 3d 353,
     364, 1992 Ohio 44, 595 N.E.2d 915, 925 (1992) (citations omitted).



This statement was dictum, since the only sufficiency-of-evidence claim raised
by respondent pertained to his setting of the fire.  Nonetheless, its
explanation of Ohio law was perfectly clear and unambiguous.  We have repeatedly
held that  [HN3] a state court's interpretation of state law, including one
announced on direct appeal of the challenged conviction, binds a federal court
sitting in habeas corpus.   [***412]   Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68,
112 S. Ct. 475, 116 L. Ed. 2d 385 (1991);  Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684,
691, 95 S. Ct. 1881, 44 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1975).

The Sixth Circuit held that the Ohio Supreme Court's opinion should not be read
to endorse transferred intent in respondent's case because such a construction
would likely constitute ""an unforeseeable and retroactive judicial expansion of
narrow and precise statutory language,""  Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S.
347, 352, 84 S. Ct. 1697, 12 L. Ed. 2d 894 (1964), in violation of the Due
Process Clause.  395 F.3d at 677 (citing  United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259,
117 S. Ct. 1219, 137 L. Ed. 2d 432 (1997);  Bouie, 378 U.S., at 351, 84 S. Ct.
1697, 12 L. Ed. 2d 894).  It is doubtful whether this principle of fair notice
has any application to a case of transferred intent, where the defendant's
contemplated conduct was exactly what the relevant  [*77]  statute forbade, see
id., at 351, 84 S. Ct. 1697, 12 L. Ed. 2d 894.  And it is further doubtful
whether the doctrine of constitutional doubt permits such a flatly
countertextual interpretation of what the Ohio Supreme Court said, see  Salinas
v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 59-60, 118 S. Ct. 469, 139 L. Ed. 2d 352 (1997).
But assuming all that, Ohio law at the time of respondent's offense provided
fully adequate notice of the applicability of transferred intent. The relevant
mens rea provision in § 2903.01(D) required only that  [HN4] ""[n]o person shall
be convicted of aggravated murder unless he is specifically found to have
intended to cause the death of another."" Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 2903.01(D)
(Anderson 1982) (emphasis added).  Respondent's intention to kill his
ex-girlfriend and her boyfriend plainly came within this provision.  There was
no reason to read ""another"" (countertextually) as meaning only ""the actual
victim,"" since the doctrine of transferred intent was ""firmly rooted in Ohio
law.""  State v. Sowell, 39 Ohio St. 3d 322, 332, 530 N.E.2d 1294, 1305 (1988)
(citing  Wareham v. State, 25 Ohio St. 601 (1874)). Respondent could not
plausibly claim unfair surprise that the doctrine applied in his case.  See
Lanier, supra, at 269-270, 117 S. Ct. 1219, 137 L. Ed. 2d 432  [HN5] (requiring,
as adequate notice for due process purposes, only ""reasonable warning,"" rather
than fundamentally similar prior cases).

The foregoing provision was in effect at the time of respondent's crime in 1986.
The Sixth Circuit reasoned, however, that the following subsequent clause in the
version of § 2903.01(D) that existed in 1986 foreclosed transferred intent in
this case:


     ""If a jury in an aggravated murder case is instructed that a person
     who commits or attempts to commit any offense listed in division (B)
     of this section may be inferred, because he engaged in a common design
     with others to commit the offense by force or violence or because the
     offense and the manner of its commission would be likely to produce
     death, to have intended to cause  [*78]  the death of any person who
     is killed during the commission of . . . the offense, the jury also
     shall be instructed that . . . it is to consider all evidence
     introduced by the prosecution to indicate the person's intent and by
     the person to indicate his lack of intent in determining whether the
     person specifically intended to cause the death of the person killed .
     . . .""  [***413]  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 2903.01(D) [**605]  (Anderson
     1982) (emphases added).



Contrary to the Sixth Circuit's reading, see  395 F.3d, at 673,  [HN6] this
clause by its terms did not apply to every case in which the defendant was
charged with aggravated felony murder, but rather only to those in which intent
to kill was sought to be proved from the inherent dangerousness of the relevant
felony. See  State v. Phillips, 74 Ohio St. 3d 72, 100, 1995 Ohio 171, 656
N.E.2d 643, 668 (1995) (""R. C. § 2903.01(D) does not apply in this case because
the trial court never instructed that the jury could infer purpose to kill from
the commission of an underlying felony in a manner 'likely to produce death'"").
Here, however, intent to kill was proved directly.  It was not inferred from the
dangerousness of the arson; it was shown to be the purpose of the arson.

[***LEdHR3] [3] The Sixth Circuit also argued that dicta in a case decided by an
intermediate Ohio appellate court, prior to the Ohio Supreme Court's opinion
here, rejected transferred intent for respondent's crime, and thus rendered its
application in respondent's case unforeseeable and retroactive.  395 F.3d, at
675-676 (citing  State v. Mullins, 76 Ohio App. 3d 633, 602 N.E.2d 769 (1992)).
But that case was decided long after the 1986 offense for which respondent was
convicted, and thus has no bearing on whether the law at the time of the charged
conduct was clear enough to provide fair notice.  Lanier, supra; see also  Marks
v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 196, 97 S. Ct. 990, 51 L. Ed. 2d 260 (1977).

[***LEdHR1A] [1C]  [***LEdHR4A] [4A] Because the Sixth Circuit disregarded the
Ohio Supreme Court's authoritative interpretation of Ohio law, its ruling on
sufficiency of the evidence was erroneous.

[*79]  II

[***LEdHR2A] [2B]  [***LEdHR4A] [4B] The Sixth Circuit also held that respondent
was entitled to relief on the ground that the state courts' denial of his
Strickland claim was unreasonable.   395 F.3d, at 688.  As petitioner contends,
the Sixth Circuit erred in its adjudication of this claim by relying on evidence
that was not properly presented to the state habeas courts without first
determining (1) whether respondent was at fault for failing to develop the
factual bases for his claims in state court, see  Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S.
420, 430-432, 120 S. Ct. 1479, 146 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000), or (2) whether
respondent satisfied the criteria established by 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2).  See
Holland v. Jackson, 542 U.S. 649, 653, 124 S. Ct. 2736, 159 L. Ed. 2d 683 (2004)
(per curiam). Similarly, the Sixth Circuit erred by disregarding the state
habeas courts' conclusion that the forensic expert whom respondent's trial
counsel hired was a ""properly qualified expert,"" App. to Pet. for Cert. 347a,
without analyzing whether the state court's factual finding had been rebutted by
clear and convincing evidence.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1).  Compare App. to
Pet. for Cert. 347a with  395 F.3d, at 683.  In addition, as petitioner
contends, the Sixth Circuit erred in relying on certain grounds that were
apparent from the trial record but not raised on direct appeal--namely that
trial counsel (1) inadequately cross-examined experts called by the State, (2)
erred by prematurely placing the forensic expert counsel had hired on the
witness list, and (3) failed to present competing scientific evidence against
the State's forensic  [***414]  experts--without first determining whether
respondent's procedural default of these subclaims could be excused by a showing
of cause and prejudice or by the need to avoid a miscarriage of justice.  See
App. to Pet. for Cert. 340a-341a, 351a-354a (state courts' holding that these
subclaims should have been raised on direct appeal); id., at 109a-110a (District
Court's holding that this default was not excusable under Coleman v. Thompson,
501 U.S. 722, 749-750,  [**606]  111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1991)).
Respondent, however, contends that the State failed to preserve its objection to
the  [*80]  Sixth Circuit's reliance on evidence not presented in state court by
failing to raise this argument properly before the Sixth Circuit.  See Brief in
Opposition 24-26.  Because the relevant errors had not yet occurred, the Sixth
Circuit has had no opportunity to address the argument that the State failed to
preserve its Holland argument.  It is better situated to address this argument
in the first instance.


     * * *



 [***LEdHR4A] [4C] For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Sixth Circuit
is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

It is so ordered.

 [*338]  [**1629]   Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.

[HN1]  [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]  A private plaintiff who claims securities
fraud must prove that the defendant's fraud caused an economic loss. 109 Stat
747, 15 USC § 78u-4(b)(4)] [15 USCS § 78u-4(b)(4)].  We consider a Ninth Circuit
holding that a plaintiff can satisfy this requirement--a requirement that courts
call ""loss causation""--simply by alleging in the complaint and subsequently
establishing that ""the price"" of the security ""on the date of purchase was
inflated because of the misrepresentation.""  339 F.3d 933, 938 (2003) (internal
quotation marks omitted).  In our view, the Ninth Circuit is wrong, both in
respect to what a plaintiff must prove and in respect to what the plaintiffs'
complaint here must allege.

[*339]  I

[***LEdHR2A]  Respondents are individuals who bought stock in Dura
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., on the public securities market between April 15, 1997,
and February 24, 1998.  They have brought this securities fraud class action
against Dura and some of [**1630]  its managers and directors (hereinafter Dura)
in federal court.  In respect to the question before us, their detailed amended
(181 paragraph) complaint makes substantially the following allegations:


     (1) Before and during the purchase period, Dura (or its officials)
     made false statements concerning both Dura's drug profits and future
     Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of a new asthmatic spray
     device.  See, e.g., App. 45a, 55a, 89a.

     (2) In respect to drug profits, Dura falsely claimed that it expected
     that its drug sales would prove profitable.  See, e.g., id., at
     66a-69a.

     (3) In respect to the asthmatic spray device, Dura falsely claimed
     that it expected the FDA would soon grant its approval.  See, e.g.,
     id., at 89a-90a, 103a-104a.

     (4) On the last day of the purchase period, February 24, 1998, Dura
     announced that its earnings would be lower than expected, principally
     due to slow drug sales.  Id., at 51a.

     (5) The next day Dura's shares lost almost half their value (falling
     from about $39 per share to about $21).  Ibid.

     (6) About eight months later (in November 1998), Dura announced that
     the FDA would not approve Dura's new asthmatic spray device.  Id., at
     110a.

     (7) The next day Dura's share price temporarily fell but almost fully
     recovered within one week.  Id., at 156a.



Most importantly, the complaint  [***584]  says the following (and nothing
significantly more than the following) about  [*340]  economic losses
attributable to the spray device misstatement: ""In reliance on the integrity of
the market, [the plaintiffs] . . . paid artificially inflated prices for Dura
securities"" and the plaintiffs suffered ""damage[s]"" thereby.  Id., at 139a
(emphasis added).

The District Court dismissed the complaint.  In respect to the plaintiffs'
drug-profitability claim, it held that the complaint failed adequately to allege
an appropriate state of mind, i.e., that defendants had acted knowingly, or the
like.  In respect to the plaintiffs' spray device claim, it held that the
complaint failed adequately to allege ""loss causation.""

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  In the portion of the
court's decision now before us--the portion that concerns the spray device
claim--the Circuit held that the complaint adequately alleged ""loss causation.""
The Circuit wrote that ""plaintiffs establish loss causation if they have shown
that the price on the date of purchase was inflated because of the
misrepresentation.""  339 F.3d at 938 (emphasis in original; internal quotation
marks and citation omitted).  It added that ""the injury occurs at the time of
the transaction."" Ibid. Since the complaint pleaded ""that the price at the time
of purchase was overstated,"" and it sufficiently identified the cause, its
allegations were legally sufficient.  Ibid.

Because the Ninth Circuit's views about loss causation differ from those of
other Circuits that have considered this issue, we granted Dura's petition for
certiorari.  Compare ibid. with, e.g.,  Emergent Capital Investment Management,
LLC v. Stonepath Group, Inc., 343 F.3d 189, 198 (CA2 2003);  Semerenko v.
Cendant Corp., 223 F.3d 165, 185 (CA3 2000);  Robbins v. Koger Properties, Inc.,
116 F.3d 1441, 1447-1448 (CA11 1997); cf.  Bastian v. Petren Resources Corp.,
892 F.2d 680, 685 (CA7 1990).  We now reverse.

[*341]  II

[HN2]  [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR3A]  Private federal securities
fraud actions are based upon federal securities statutes and their implementing
regulations.  Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [**1631]
forbids (1) the ""use or employ[ment] . . . of any . . . deceptive device,"" (2)
""in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,"" and (3) ""in
contravention of"" Securities and Exchange Commission ""rules and regulations."" 15
USC § 78j(b) [15 USCS § 78j(b)].  Commission Rule 10b-5 forbids, among other
things, the making of any ""untrue statement of a material fact"" or the omission
of any material fact ""necessary in order to make the statements made . . . not
misleading."" 17 CFR § 240.10b-5 (2004).

The courts have implied from these statutes and Rule a private damages action,
which resembles, but is not identical to, common-law tort actions for deceit and
misrepresentation. See, e.g.,  Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S.
723, 730, 744, 44 L. Ed. 2d 539, 95 S. Ct. 1917 (1975);  Ernst & Ernst v.
Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 196, 47 L. Ed. 2d 668, 96 S. Ct. 1375 (1976).  And
Congress has imposed statutory requirements on that private action.  E.g., 15
USC § 78u-4(b)(4) [15 USCS § 78u-4(b)(4)].

[HN3] In cases involving publicly traded securities and purchases or sales in
public securities markets, the action's basic elements include:  [***585]


     (1) a material misrepresentation (or omission), see  Basic Inc. v.
     Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 231-232, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194, 108 S. Ct. 978
     (1988);

     (2) scienter, i.e., a wrongful state of mind, see  Ernst & Ernst,
     supra, at 197, 199, 47 L. Ed. 2d 668, 96 S. Ct. 1375;

     (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security, see  Blue
     Chip Stamps, supra, at 730-731, 44 L. Ed. 2d 539, 95 S. Ct. 1917;

     (4) reliance, often referred to in cases involving public securities
     markets (fraud-on-the-market cases) as ""transaction causation,"" see
     Basic, supra, at 248-249, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194, 108 S. Ct. 978
     (nonconclusively presuming that the price of a publicly  [*342]
     traded share reflects a material misrepresentation and that plaintiffs
     have relied upon that misrepresentation as long as they would not have
     bought the share in its absence);

     (5) economic loss, 15 USC § 78u-4(b)(4) [15 USCS § 78u-4(b)(4)]; and

     (6) ""loss causation,"" i.e., a causal connection between the material
     misrepresentation and the loss, ibid.; cf. T. Hazen, Law of Securities
     Regulation §§ 12.11[1], [3] (5th ed. 2005).



Dura argues that the complaint's allegations are inadequate in respect to these
last two elements.

[***LEdHR1A]  We begin with the Ninth Circuit's basic reason for finding the
complaint adequate, namely, that at the end of the day plaintiffs need only
""establish,"" i.e., prove, that ""the price on the date of purchase was inflated
because of the misrepresentation.""  339 F.3d at 938 (internal quotation marks
and citation omitted).  In our view, this statement of the law is wrong.   [HN4]
Normally, in cases such as this one (i.e., fraud-on-the-market cases), an
inflated purchase price will not itself constitute or proximately cause the
relevant economic loss.

For one thing, as a matter of pure logic, at the moment the transaction takes
place, the plaintiff has suffered no loss; the inflated purchase payment is
offset by ownership of a share that at that instant possesses equivalent value.
Moreover, the logical link between the inflated share purchase price and any
later economic loss is not invariably strong.  Shares are normally purchased
with an eye toward a later sale.  But if, say, the purchaser sells the shares
quickly before the relevant truth begins to leak out, the misrepresentation will
not have led to any loss.  If the purchaser [**1632]  sells later after the
truth makes its way into the marketplace, an initially inflated purchase price
might mean a later loss.  But that is far from inevitably so.  When the  [*343]
purchaser subsequently resells such shares, even at a lower price, that lower
price may reflect, not the earlier misrepresentation, but changed economic
circumstances, changed investor expectations, new industry-specific or
firm-specific facts, conditions, or other events, which taken separately or
together account for some or all of that lower price. (The same is true in
respect to a claim that a share's higher price is lower than it would otherwise
have been--a claim we do not consider here.) Other things being equal, the
longer the time between purchase and sale, the more likely that this is
[***586]  so, i.e., the more likely that other factors caused the loss.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR3A]  Given the tangle of factors affecting price, the
most logic alone permits us to say is that the higher purchase price will
sometimes play a role in bringing about a future loss.  It may prove to be a
necessary condition of any such loss, and in that sense one might say that the
inflated purchase price suggests that the misrepresentation (using language the
Ninth Circuit used) ""touches upon"" a later economic loss. Ibid. But, even if
that is so, it is insufficient.   [HN5] To ""touch upon"" a loss is not to cause a
loss, and it is the latter that the law requires.  15 USC § 78u-4(b)(4) [15 USCS
§ 78u-4(b)(4)].

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR3A]   [***LEdHR4] [4]  [***LEdHR5A]  For another thing,
the Ninth Circuit's holding lacks support in precedent.   [HN6] Judicially
implied private securities fraud actions resemble in many (but not all) respects
common-law deceit and misrepresentation actions.  See  Blue Chip Stamps, supra,
at 744, 44 L. Ed. 2d 539, 95 S. Ct. 1917; see also L. Loss & J. Seligman,
Fundamentals of Securities Regulation 910-918 (5th ed. 2004) (describing
relationship to common-law deceit).  The common law of deceit subjects a person
who ""fraudulently"" makes a ""misrepresentation"" to liability ""for pecuniary loss
caused"" to one who justifiably relies upon that misrepresentation. Restatement
(Second) of Torts § 525, p 55 (1976) (hereinafter Restatement of Torts); see
also  Southern Development Co. v. Silva, 125 U.S. 247, 250, 31 L. Ed. 678, 8 S.
Ct. 881 (1888) (setting forth elements of fraudulent misrepresentation).  And
the common law has long insisted that a plaintiff in such a case show  [*344]
not only that had he known the truth he would not have acted but also that he
suffered actual economic loss. See, e.g., Pasley v Freeman, 3 T. R. 51, 65, 100
Eng. Rep. 450, 457 (1789) (if ""no injury is occasioned by the lie, it is not
actionable: but if it be attended with a damage, it then becomes the subject of
an action"");  Freeman v. Venner, 120 Mass. 424, 426 (1876) (a mortgagee cannot
bring a tort action for damages stemming from a fraudulent note that a
misrepresentation led him to execute unless and until the note has to be paid);
see also M. Bigelow, Law of Torts 101 (8th ed. 1907) (damage ""must already have
been suffered before the bringing of the suit""); 2 T. Cooley, Law of Torts §
348, p 551 (4th ed. 1932) (plaintiff must show that he ""suffered damage"" and
that the ""damage followed proximately the deception""); W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R.
Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts § 110, p 765 (5th ed.
1984) (hereinafter Prosser and Keeton) (plaintiff ""must have suffered
substantial damage,"" not simply nominal damages, before ""the cause of action can
arise"").

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR5A]  Given the common-law roots of the securities fraud
action (and the common-law requirement that a plaintiff show actual damages), it
is not surprising that other Courts of Appeals have rejected the Ninth Circuit's
""inflated purchase price"" approach to proving causation and loss.  See,
[**1633]  e.g.,  Emergent Capital, 343 F.3d, at 198 (inflation of purchase price
alone cannot satisfy loss causation);  Semerenko, 223 F.3d, at 185 (same);
Robbins, 116 F.3d, at 1448 (same); cf.  Bastian, 892 F.2d, at 685.  Indeed, the
Restatement of Torts, in setting forth the judicial consensus, says that  [HN7]
a person who ""misrepresents the financial condition of a corporation in order to
sell its stock""  [***587]  becomes liable to a relying purchaser ""for the loss""
the purchaser sustains ""when the facts . . . become generally known"" and ""as a
result"" share value ""depreciate[s]."" § 548A, Comment b, at 107.  Treatise
writers, too, have emphasized the need to prove proximate causation. Prosser and
Keeton § 110, at 767 (losses do ""not  [*345]  afford any basis for recovery"" if
""brought about by business conditions or other factors"").

[***LEdHR1A]  We cannot reconcile the Ninth Circuit's ""inflated purchase price""
approach with these views of other courts.  And the uniqueness of its
perspective argues against the validity of its approach in a case like this one
where we consider the contours of a judicially implied cause of action with
roots in the common law.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR6] [6]  [***LEdHR7A]  Finally, the Ninth Circuit's
approach overlooks an important securities law objective.   [HN8] The securities
statutes seek to maintain public confidence in the marketplace.  See  United
States v. O'Hagan, 521 U.S. 642, 658, 138 L. Ed. 2d 724, 117 S. Ct. 2199 (1997).
They do so by deterring fraud, in part, through the availability of private
securities fraud actions.   Randall v. Loftsgaarden, 478 U.S. 647, 664, 92 L.
Ed. 2d 525, 106 S. Ct. 3143 (1986).  But the statutes make these latter actions
available, not to provide investors with broad insurance against market losses,
but to protect them against those economic losses that misrepresentations
actually cause.  Cf.  Basic, 485 U.S., at 252, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194, 108 S. Ct. 978
(White, J., joined by O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)
(""[A]llowing recovery in the face of affirmative evidence of nonreliance--would
effectively convert Rule 10b-5 into a scheme of investor's insurance.  There is
no support in the Securities Exchange Act, the Rule, or our cases for such a
result"" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).

[***LEdHR1A]  The statutory provision at issue here and the paragraphs that
precede it emphasize this last mentioned objective.  Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, 109 Stat 737.   [HN9] The statute insists that
securities fraud complaints ""specify"" each misleading statement; that they set
forth the facts ""on which [a] belief"" that a statement is misleading was
""formed""; and that they ""state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong
inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind."" 15 USC §§
78u-4(b)(1), (2) [15 USCS §§ 78u-4(b)(1), (2)].  And the statute expressly
imposes on plaintiffs ""the burden of proving"" that the defendant's
misrepresentations [*346]  ""caused the loss for which the plaintiff seeks to
recover."" § 78u-4(b)(4).

The statute thereby makes clear Congress' intent to permit private securities
fraud actions for recovery where, but only where, plaintiffs adequately allege
and prove the traditional elements of causation and loss.  By way of contrast,
the Ninth Circuit's approach would allow recovery where a misrepresentation
leads to an inflated purchase price but nonetheless does not proximately cause
any economic loss. That is to say, it would permit recovery where these two
traditional elements in fact are missing.

In sum, we find the Ninth Circuit's approach inconsistent with the law's
requirement that a plaintiff prove that the defendant's misrepresentation (or
other fraudulent conduct) proximately caused the plaintiff's  [***588]  economic
loss. We need [**1634]  not, and do not, consider other proximate cause or
loss-related questions.

B

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR8] [8] Our holding about plaintiffs' need
to prove proximate causation and economic loss leads us also to conclude that
the plaintiffs' complaint here failed adequately to allege these requirements.
We concede that  [HN10] the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require only ""a
short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to
relief."" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2).  And we assume, at least for argument's
sake, that neither the Rules nor the securities statutes impose any special
further requirement in respect to the pleading of proximate causation or
economic loss. But, even so, the ""short and plain statement"" must provide the
defendant with ""fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds
upon which it rests.  ""  Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80, 78
S. Ct. 99 (1957).  The complaint before us fails this simple test.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2A]  As we have pointed out, the plaintiffs' lengthy
complaint contains only one statement that we can fairly read as describing the
loss caused by the defendants' ""spray device""  [*347]  misrepresentations. That
statement says that the plaintiffs ""paid artificially inflated prices for Dura's
securities"" and suffered ""damage[s]."" App. 139a.  The statement implies that the
plaintiffs' loss consisted of the ""artificially inflated"" purchase ""prices."" The
complaint's failure to claim that Dura['s] share price fell significantly after
the truth became known suggests that the plaintiffs considered the allegation of
purchase price inflation alone sufficient.  The complaint contains nothing that
suggests otherwise.

For reasons set forth in Part II-A, supra, however, the ""artificially inflated
purchase price"" is not itself a relevant economic loss. And the complaint
nowhere else provides the defendants with notice of what the relevant economic
loss might be or of what the causal connection might be between that loss and
the misrepresentation concerning Dura's ""spray device.""

[***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR7A]   [***LEdHR9] [9] We concede that  [HN11] ordinary
pleading rules are not meant to impose a great burden upon a plaintiff.
Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A., 534 U.S. 506, 513-515, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1, 122 S. Ct.
992 (2002).  But it should not prove burdensome for a plaintiff who has suffered
an economic loss to provide a defendant with some indication of the loss and the
causal connection that the plaintiff has in mind.  At the same time, allowing a
plaintiff to forgo giving any indication of the economic loss and proximate
cause that the plaintiff has in mind would bring about harm of the very sort the
statutes seek to avoid.  Cf. H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-369, p 31 (1995)
(criticizing ""abusive"" practices including ""the routine filing of lawsuits . . .
with only [a] faint hope that the discovery process might lead eventually to
some plausible cause of action"").  It would permit a plaintiff ""with a largely
groundless claim to simply take up the time of a number of other people, with
the right to do so representing an in terrorem increment of the settlement
value, rather than a reasonably founded hope that the [discovery] process will
reveal relevant evidence."" Blue Chip Stamps, 421 U.S., at 741, 44 L. Ed. 2d 539,
95 S. Ct. 1917.  Such a rule would  [***589]  tend to transform a private
[*348]  securities action into a partial downside insurance policy.  See H. R.
Conf. Rep. No. 104-369, at 31; see also  Basic, supra, 485 U.S., at 252, 99 L.
Ed. 2d 194, 108 S. Ct. 978 (White, J., joined by O'Connor, J., concurring in
part and dissenting in part).

[***LEdHR2A]  For these reasons, we find the plaintiffs' complaint legally
insufficient. We reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit, and we [**1635]
remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

In response to petitioners' complaints, respondent prison officials have mounted
a facial challenge to the institutionalized-persons provision of RLUIPA;
respondents contend, inter alia, that the Act improperly advances religion in
violation of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. The District Court
denied respondents' motion to dismiss petitioners' complaints, but the Court of
Appeals reversed that determination. The appeals court held, as the prison
officials urged, that the portion of RLUIPA applicable to institutionalized
persons, 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1, violates the Establishment Clause. We reverse the
Court of Appeals' judgment.

A

RLUIPA is the latest of long-running congressional efforts to accord religious
exercise heightened protection from government-imposed burdens, consistent with
[**2118]  this Court's precedents. Ten years before RLUIPA's enactment, the
Court held, in  Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494
U.S. 872, 878-882, 108 L. Ed. 2d 876, 110 S. Ct. 1595 (1990), that the First
Amendment's Free Exercise Clause does not inhibit enforcement of otherwise valid
laws of general application that incidentally burden religious conduct. In
particular, we ruled that the Free Exercise Clause did not bar Oregon from
enforcing its blanket ban on peyote possession with no allowance for sacramental
use of the drug. Accordingly, the State could deny unemployment benefits to
persons dismissed from their jobs because of their religiously inspired peyote
use.  Id., at 874, 890, 108 L. Ed. 2d 876, 110 S. Ct. 1595. The Court
recognized, however, that the political  [***1030]  branches could shield
religious exercise through legislative accommodation, for example, by making an
exception to proscriptive drug laws for sacramental peyote use.  Id., at 890,
108 L. Ed. 2d 876, 110 S. Ct. 1595.

Responding to Smith, Congress enacted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of
1993 (RFRA),  107 Stat. 1488, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq. RFRA ""prohibits
'government' from 'substantially burdening' a person's exercise of religion even
if the burden results from a rule of general applicability unless the government
can demonstrate the burden '(1)  [*715]  is in furtherance of a compelling
governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that
compelling governmental interest.'""  City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507,
515-516, 138 L. Ed. 2d 624, 117 S. Ct. 2157 (1997) (quoting § 2000bb-1; brackets
in original). ""Universal"" in its coverage, RFRA ""applied to all Federal and
State law,""  id., at 516, 138 L. Ed. 2d 624, 117 S. Ct. 2157 (quoting former §
2000bb-3(a)), but notably lacked a Commerce Clause underpinning or a Spending
Clause limitation to recipients of federal funds. In City of Boerne, this Court
invalidated RFRA as applied to States and their subdivisions, holding that the
Act exceeded Congress' remedial powers under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Id., at
532-536, 138 L. Ed. 2d 624, 117 S. Ct. 2157. 2

2 RFRA, Courts of Appeals have held, remains operative as to the Federal
Government and federal territories and possessions. See  O'Bryan v. Bureau of
Prisons, 349 F.3d 399, 400-401 (CA7 2003);  Guam v. Guerrero, 290 F.3d 1210,

occasion to rule on the matter.

 Congress again responded, this time by enacting RLUIPA. Less sweeping than
RFRA, and invoking federal authority under the Spending and Commerce Clauses,
RLUIPA targets two areas: Section 2 of the Act concerns land-use regulation, 42
U.S.C. § 2000cc; 3 § 3 relates to religious exercise by institutionalized
persons, § 2000cc-1.  [HN1] Section 3, at issue here, provides that ""no [state
or local] government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise
of a person residing in or confined to an institution,"" unless the government
shows that the burden furthers ""a compelling governmental interest"" and does so
by ""the least restrictive means."" § 2000cc-1(a)(1)-(2). The Act defines
""religious exercise"" to include ""any exercise of religion, whether or not
compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief."" § 2000cc-5(7)(A).
Section 3 applies when ""the substantial burden [on religious exercise] is
imposed in a program or  [*716]  activity that receives Federal financial
assistance,"" 4 or ""the substantial burden affects,  [**2119]  or removal of that
substantial burden would affect, commerce with foreign nations, among the
several States, or with Indian tribes.  "" § 2000cc-1(b)(1)-(2). ""A person may
assert a violation of [RLUIPA] as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding
[***1031]  and obtain appropriate relief against a government."" § 2000cc-2(a).

validity of that part of the Act.

Before enacting § 3, Congress documented, in hearings spanning three years, that
""frivolous or arbitrary"" barriers impeded institutionalized persons' religious
exercise. See 146 Cong. Rec. 16698, 16699 (2000) (joint statement of Sen. Hatch
and Sen. Kennedy on RLUIPA) (hereinafter Joint Statement) (""Whether from
indifference, ignorance, bigotry, or lack of resources, some institutions
restrict religious liberty in egregious and unnecessary ways.""). 5 To secure
[*717]  redress for inmates who encountered undue barriers to their religious
observances, Congress carried over from RFRA the ""compelling governmental
interest""/""least restrictive means"" standard. See id., at 16698. Lawmakers
anticipated, however, that courts entertaining complaints under § 3 would accord
""due deference to the experience and expertise of prison and jail
administrators."" Id., at 16699 (quoting S. Rep. No. 103-111, p. 10 (1993)).

5 The hearings held by Congress revealed, for a typical example, that ""[a] state
prison in Ohio refused to provide Moslems with Hallal food, even though it
provided Kosher food."" Hearing on Protecting Religious Freedom After Boerne v.
Flores before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the House Committee on the
Judiciary, 105th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 3, p. 11, n. 1 (1998) (hereinafter
Protecting Religious Freedom) (prepared statement of Marc D. Stern, Legal
Director, American Jewish Congress). Across the country, Jewish inmates
complained that prison officials refused to provide sack lunches, which would
enable inmates to break their fasts after nightfall. Id., at 39 (statement of
Isaac M. Jaroslawicz, Director of Legal Affairs for the Aleph Institute). The

Petitioners initially filed suit against respondents asserting claims under the
First and Fourteenth Amendments. After RLUIPA's enactment, petitioners amended
their complaints to include claims under § 3. Respondents moved to dismiss the
statutory claims, arguing, inter alia, that § 3 violates the Establishment
Clause.  221 F. Supp. 2d, at 846. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2403(a), the United
States intervened in the District Court to defend RLUIPA's constitutionality.
349 F.3d 257, 261 (CA6 2003).

Adopting the report and recommendation of the Magistrate Judge, the District
Court rejected the argument that § 3 conflicts with the Establishment Clause.
221 F. Supp. 2d, at 846-848. As to the Act's impact on a prison's staff and
general inmate population, the court stated that RLUIPA ""permits safety and
security -- which are undisputedly compelling state interests -- to outweigh an
inmate's claim to a religious accommodation.""  Id., at 848.  [**2120]  On the
thin record before it, the court declined to find, as respondents had urged,
that enforcement of RLUIPA, inevitably, would compromise prison security. Ibid.

On interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b),  [***1032]  the Court
of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed. Citing  Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S.
602, 29 L. Ed. 2d 745, 91 S. Ct. 2105 (1971), 6 the Court of Appeals  [*718]
held that § 3 of RLUIPA ""impermissibly advances religion by giving greater
protection to religious rights than to other constitutionally protected rights.""
349 F.3d at 264. Affording ""religious prisoners rights superior to those of
nonreligious prisoners,"" the court suggested, might ""encourage prisoners to
become religious in order to enjoy greater rights.""  Id., at 266.

6 Lemon stated a three-part test: ""First, the statute must have a secular
legislative purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that
neither advances nor inhibits religion; finally, the statute must not foster an
excessive government entanglement with religion.""  403 U.S., at 612-613, 29 L.

is consistent with the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  543 U.S.

7 Respondents argued below that RLUIPA exceeds Congress' legislative powers
under the Spending and Commerce Clauses and violates the Tenth Amendment. The
District Court rejected respondents' challenges under the Spending Clause,
Gerhardt v. Lazaroff, 221 F. Supp. 2d 827, 839-849 (SD Ohio 2002), and the Tenth
Amendment,  id., at 850-851, and declined to reach the Commerce Clause question,
id., at 838-839. The Sixth Circuit, having determined that RLUIPA violates the
Establishment Clause, did not rule on respondents' further arguments. See  349
F.3d 257, 259-260, 269 (2003). Respondents renew those arguments in this Court.
They also augment their federalism-based or residual-powers contentions by
asserting that, in the space between the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses
, the States' choices are not subject to congressional oversight. See Brief for
Respondents 9, 25-33; cf.  Madison v. Riter, 355 F.3d 310, 322 (CA4 2003).
Because these defensive pleas were not addressed by the Court of Appeals, and
mindful that we are a court of review, not of first view, we do not consider
them here. See  F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd v. Empagran S. A., 542 U.S. 155, 175,

A

[HN2] The Religion Clauses of the First Amendment provide: ""Congress shall make
no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise
thereof."" The first of the two Clauses, commonly called the Establishment Clause
, commands a separation of church and state. The second, the Free Exercise
Clause, requires government respect for, and noninterference with, the religious
beliefs and practices of our Nation's people. While the two Clauses express
complementary values, they often exert conflicting pressures. See  Locke, 540
U.S., at 718, 158 L. Ed. 2d 1, 124 S. Ct. 1307 (""These two Clauses . . . are
frequently in tension."");  Walz, 397 U.S., at 668-669, 25 L. Ed. 2d 697, 90 S.
Ct. 1409 (""The Court  [**2121]  has struggled to find a neutral course between
the two Religion Clauses, both of which are cast in absolute  [***1033]  terms,
and either of which, if expanded to a logical extreme, would tend to clash with
the other."").

[HN3] Our decisions recognize that ""there is room for play in the joints""
between the Clauses,  id., at 669, 25 L. Ed. 2d 697, 90 S. Ct. 1409, some space
for legislative action neither compelled by the Free Exercise Clause nor
prohibited by the Establishment Clause. See, e.g.,  Smith, 494 U.S., at 890, 108
L. Ed. 2d 876, 110 S. Ct. 1595 (""[A] society that believes in the negative
protection accorded to religious belief can be expected to be solicitous of that
value in its legislation . . . ."");  Amos, 483 U.S., at 329-330, 97 L. Ed. 2d
273, 107 S. Ct. 2862 (Federal Government may exempt secular nonprofit activities
of religious organizations from Title VII's prohibition on religious
discrimination in employment);  Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 422, 10 L. Ed.
2d 965, 83 S. Ct. 1790 (1963) (Harlan, J., dissenting) (""The constitutional
obligation of 'neutrality' is not so narrow a channel that the slightest
deviation from an absolutely straight course leads to condemnation."" (citation
omitted)). In accord with the majority of Courts of Appeals that have ruled on
the question, see supra, at 718 and this page,  [*720]  we hold that  [HN4] § 3
of RLUIPA fits within the corridor between the Religion Clauses: On its face,
the Act qualifies as a permissible legislative accommodation of religion that is
not barred by the Establishment Clause.

Foremost, we find  [HN5] RLUIPA's institutionalized-persons provision compatible
with the Establishment Clause because it alleviates exceptional
government-created burdens on private religious exercise. See  Board of Ed. of
Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U.S. 687, 705, 129 L. Ed. 2d
546, 114 S. Ct. 2481 (1994) (government need not ""be oblivious to impositions
that legitimate exercises of state power may place on religious belief and
practice"");  Amos, 483 U.S., at 349, 97 L. Ed. 2d 273, 107 S. Ct. 2862
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment) (removal of government-imposed burdens on
religious exercise is more likely to be perceived ""as an accommodation of the
exercise of religion rather than as a Government endorsement of religion"").
Furthermore, the Act on its face does not founder on shoals our prior decisions
have identified: Properly applying RLUIPA, courts must take adequate account of
the burdens a requested accommodation may impose on nonbeneficiaries, see
Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, Inc., 472 U.S. 703, 86 L. Ed. 2d 557, 105 S. Ct.
2914 (1985); and they must be satisfied that the Act's prescriptions are and
will be administered neutrally among different faiths, see  Bd. of Ed. of Kiryas
Joel School Dist. v. Grumet , 512 U.S. 687, 129 L. Ed. 2d 546, 114 S. Ct. 2481
(1994). 8

8 Directed at obstructions institutional arrangements place on religious
observances, RLUIPA does not require a State to pay for an inmate's devotional
accessories. See, e.g.,  Charles v. Verhagen, 348 F.3d 601, 605 (CA7 2003)
(overturning prohibition on possession of Islamic prayer oil but leaving
inmate-plaintiff with responsibility for purchasing the oil).

  [HN6] ""The 'exercise of religion' often involves not only belief and
profession but the performance of . . . physical acts [such as] assembling with
others for a worship service [or] participating in sacramental use of bread and
wine . . . .""  Smith, 494 U.S., at 877, 108 L. Ed. 2d 876, 110 S. Ct. 1595.
Section 3 covers state-run institutions -- mental hospitals, prisons, and the
like -- in which  [***1034]  the government exerts a degree of control
unparalleled in civilian society  [*721]  and severely disabling to private
religious exercise. 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a); § 1997; see Joint Statement 16699
(""Institutional residents' right to practice their faith is at the mercy
[**2122]  of those running the institution.""). 9 RLUIPA thus protects
institutionalized persons who are unable freely to attend to their religious
needs and are therefore dependent on the government's permission and
accommodation for exercise of their religion. 10

9 See, e.g., ibid. (prison's regulation prohibited Muslim prisoner from
possessing ritual cleansing oil);  Young v. Lane, 922 F.2d 370, 375-376 (CA7
1991) (prison's regulation restricted wearing of yarmulkes);  Hunafa v. Murphy,
907 F.2d 46, 47-48 (CA7 1990) (noting instances in which Jewish and Muslim
prisoners were served pork, with no substitute available).

10 Respondents argue, in line with the Sixth Circuit, that RLUIPA goes beyond
permissible reduction of impediments to free exercise. The Act, they project,
advances religion by encouraging prisoners to ""get religion,"" and thereby gain
accommodations afforded under RLUIPA. Brief for Respondents 15-17; see  349 F.3d
at 266 (""One effect of RLUIPA is to induce prisoners to adopt or feign religious
belief in order to receive the statute's benefits.""). While some accommodations
of religious observance, notably the opportunity to assemble in worship
services, might attract joiners seeking a break in their closely guarded day, we
doubt that all accommodations would be perceived as ""benefits."" For example,
congressional hearings on RLUIPA revealed that one state corrections system
served as its kosher diet ""a fruit, a vegetable, a granola bar, and a liquid
nutritional supplement -- each and every meal."" Protecting Religious Freedom,
pt. 3, at 38 (statement of Jaroslawicz).

The argument, in any event, founders on the fact that Ohio already facilitates
religious services for mainstream faiths. The State provides chaplains, allows
inmates to possess religious items, and permits assembly for worship. See App.
199 (affidavit of David Schwarz, Religious Services Administrator for the South
Region of the Ohio Dept. of Rehabilitation and Correction (Oct. 19, 2000)) (job
duties include ""facilitating the delivery of religious services in 14
correctional institutions of various security levels throughout . . . Ohio"");

  [*722]  We note in this regard the Federal Government's accommodation of
religious practice by members of the military. See, e.g., 10 U.S.C. § 3073
(referring to Army chaplains);  Katcoff v. Marsh, 755 F.2d 223, 225-229 (CA2
1985) (describing the Army chaplaincy program). In  Goldman v. Weinberger, 475
U.S. 503, 89 L. Ed. 2d 478, 106 S. Ct. 1310 (1986), we held that the Free
Exercise Clause did not require the Air Force to exempt an Orthodox Jewish
officer from uniform dress regulations so that he could wear a yarmulke indoors.
In a military community, the Court observed, ""there is simply not the same
[individual] autonomy as there is in the larger civilian community.""  Id., at
507, 89 L. Ed. 2d 478, 106 S. Ct. 1310 (brackets in original; internal quotation
marks omitted). Congress responded to Goldman by prescribing that ""a member of
the armed forces may wear an item of religious apparel while wearing the
uniform,"" unless ""the wearing of the item would interfere with the performance
[of] military duties [or] the item of apparel is not neat and conservative."" 10
U.S.C. § 774(a)-(b).

[HN7] We do not read RLUIPA to elevate  [***1035]  accommodation of religious
observances over an institution's need to maintain order and safety. Our
decisions indicate that an accommodation must be measured so that it does not
override other significant interests. In Caldor, the Court struck down a
Connecticut law that  [**2123]  ""armed Sabbath observers with an absolute and
unqualified right not to work on whatever day they designated as their Sabbath.""
472 U.S., at 709, 86 L. Ed. 2d 557, 105 S. Ct. 2914. We held the law invalid
under the Establishment Clause because it ""unyieldingly weighted"" the interests
of Sabbatarians ""over all other interests.""  Id., at 710, 86 L. Ed. 2d 557, 105
S. Ct. 2914.

[HN8] We have no cause to believe that RLUIPA would not be applied in an
appropriately balanced way, with particular sensitivity to security concerns.
While the Act adopts a  [*723]  ""compelling governmental interest"" standard, see
supra, at 715, ""context matters"" in the application of that standard. See
Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 327, 156 L. Ed. 2d 304, 123 S. Ct. 2325
(2003). 11 Lawmakers supporting RLUIPA were mindful of the urgency of
discipline, order, safety, and security in penal institutions. See, e.g., 139
Cong. Rec. 26190 (1993) (remarks of Sen. Hatch). They anticipated that courts
would apply the Act's standard with ""due deference to the experience and
expertise of prison and jail administrators in establishing necessary
regulations and procedures to maintain good order, security and discipline,
consistent with consideration of costs and limited resources."" Joint Statement
16699 (quoting S. Rep. No. 103-111, at 10). 12

11 The Sixth Circuit posited that an irreligious prisoner and member of the
Aryan Nation who challenges prison officials' confiscation of his white
supremacist literature as a violation of his free association and expression
rights would have his claims evaluated under the deferential
rational-relationship standard described in  Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 96
L. Ed. 2d 64, 107 S. Ct. 2254 (1987). A member of the Church of Jesus Christ
Christian challenging a similar withholding, the Sixth Circuit assumed, would
have a stronger prospect of success because a court would review his claim under
RLUIPA's compelling-interest standard.  349 F.3d at 266 (citing  Madison v.
Riter, 240 F. Supp. 2d 566, 576 (WD Va. 2003)). Courts, however, may be expected
to recognize the government's countervailing compelling interest in not
facilitating inflammatory racist activity that could imperil prison security and
order. Cf.  Reimann v. Murphy, 897 F. Supp. 398, 402-403 (ED Wis. 1995)
(concluding, under RFRA, that excluding racist literature advocating violence
was the least restrictive means of furthering the compelling state interest in
preventing prison violence);  George v. Sullivan, 896 F. Supp. 895, 898 (WD Wis.
1995) (same).

12 State prison officials make the first judgment about whether to provide a
particular accommodation, for a prisoner may not sue under RLUIPA without first
exhausting all available administrative remedies. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-2(e)
(nothing in RLUIPA ""shall be construed to amend or repeal the Prison Litigation
Reform Act of 1995""); § 1997e(a) (requiring exhaustion of administrative
remedies).

Finally,  [HN9] RLUIPA does not differentiate among bona fide faiths. In Kiryas
Joel, we invalidated a state law that carved out a separate school district to
serve exclusively a  [*724]  community of highly religious Jews, the Satmar
Hasidim. We held that the law violated the Establishment Clause,  512 U.S., at
690, 129 L. Ed. 2d 546, 114 S. Ct. 2481, in part because it ""singled out a
particular religious sect for special treatment,""  id., at 706, 129 L. Ed. 2d
546, 114 S. Ct. 2481 (footnote omitted). RLUIPA presents no such defect. It
confers no privileged  [***1036]  status on any particular religious sect, and
singles out no bona fide faith for disadvantageous treatment.

B

The Sixth Circuit misread our precedents to require invalidation of RLUIPA as
""impermissibly advancing religion by giving greater protection to religious
rights than to other constitutionally protected rights.""  349 F.3d at 264. Our
decision in Amos counsels otherwise.  [**2124]  There, we upheld against an
Establishment Clause challenge a provision exemp"

 [*213]  [**2388]   Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A]  This case involves the process by which Ohio classifies prisoners
for placement at its highest security prison, known as a ""Supermax"" facility.
Supermax facilities are maximum-security prisons with highly restrictive
conditions, designed to segregate the most dangerous prisoners from the general
prison population.  We must consider what process the Fourteenth Amendment to
the United States Constitution requires Ohio to afford to inmates before
assigning them to Supermax.  We hold that the procedures Ohio has  [**2389]
adopted provide sufficient procedural protection to comply with due process
requirements.

I

The use of Supermax prisons has increased over the last 20 years, in part as a
response to the rise in prison gangs and prison violence.  See generally U. S.
Dept. of Justice, National Institute of Corrections, C. Riveland, Supermax
Prisons: Overview and General Considerations 1 (1999),
http://www.nicic.org/pubs/1999/014937.pdf (as visited June 29, 2005, and
available in Clerk of Court's case file).  About 30 States now operate Supermax
prisons, in addition to the two operated by the Federal Government.  [*214]
See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 2.  In 1998, Ohio opened its only
Supermax facility, the Ohio State Penitentiary (OSP), after a riot in one of its
maximum-security prisons. OSP has the capacity to house up to 504 inmates in
single-inmate cells and is designed to ""'separate the most predatory and
dangerous prisoners from the rest of the . . . general [prison] population.'""
See  189 F. Supp. 2d 719, 723 (ND Ohio 2002) (Austin I) (quoting deposition of
R. Wilkinson, pp 24-25).

Conditions at OSP are more restrictive than any other form of incarceration in
Ohio, including conditions on its death row or in its administrative control
units.  The latter are themselves a highly restrictive form of solitary
confinement. See  Austin I, supra, 724-725, and n 5 (citing Ohio Admin.  Code §
5120-9-13 (2001) (rescinded 2004)).  In OSP almost every aspect of an inmate's
life is controlled and monitored.  Inmates must remain in their cells, which
measure 7 by 14 feet, for 23 hours per day.  A light remains on in the cell at
all times, though it is sometimes dimmed, and an inmate who attempts to shield
the light to sleep is subject to further discipline.  During the one hour per
day that an inmate may leave his cell, access is limited to one of two indoor
recreation cells.

Incarceration at OSP is synonymous with extreme isolation.  In contrast to any
other Ohio prison, including any segregation unit, OSP cells have solid metal
doors with metal strips along their sides and bottoms which prevent conversation
or communication with other inmates. All meals are taken alone in the inmate's
cell instead of in a common eating area.  Opportunities for visitation are rare
and in all events are conducted through glass walls.  It is fair to say OSP
inmates are deprived of almost any environmental or sensory stimuli and of
almost all human contact.

Aside from the severity of the conditions,  [***185]  placement at OSP is for an
indefinite period of time, limited only by an  [*215]  inmate's sentence. For an
inmate serving a life sentence, there is no indication how long he may be
incarcerated at OSP once assigned there.   Austin I, supra, at 740.  Inmates
otherwise eligible for parole lose their eligibility while incarcerated at OSP.
189 F. Supp. 2d, at 728.

Placement at OSP is determined in the following manner: Upon entering the prison
system, all Ohio inmates are assigned a numerical security classification from
level 1 through level 5, with 1 the lowest security risk and 5 the highest.  See
Brief for Petitioners 7.  The initial security classification is based on
numerous factors (e.g., the nature of the underlying offense, criminal history,
or gang affiliation) but is subject to modification at any time during the
inmate's prison term if, for instance, he engages in misconduct or is deemed a
security risk.  Ibid. Level 5 inmates are placed in OSP, and levels 1 through 4
inmates are placed at lower security facilities throughout the State.  Ibid.

[**2390]  Ohio concedes that when OSP first became operational, the procedures
used to assign inmates to the facility were inconsistent and undefined.  For a
time, no official policy governing placement was in effect.  See  Austin I,
supra, at 726-727.  Haphazard placements were not uncommon, and some individuals
who did not pose high-security risks were designated, nonetheless, for OSP.  In
an effort to establish guidelines for the selection and classification of
inmates suitable for OSP, Ohio issued Department of Rehabilitation and
Correction Policy 111-07 (Aug. 31, 1998).  This policy has been revised at
various points but relevant here are two versions: the ""Old Policy"" and the ""New
Policy."" The Old Policy took effect on January 28, 1999, but problems with
assignment appear to have persisted even under this written set of standards.
189 F. Supp. 2d, at 728-736.  After forming a committee to study the matter and
retaining a national expert in prison security, Ohio promulgated the New Policy
in early 2002.  The New Policy provided more guidance regarding  [*216]  the
factors to be considered in placement decisions and afforded inmates more
procedural protection against erroneous placement at OSP.

[***LEdHR2] [2] Although the record is not altogether clear regarding the
precise manner in which the New Policy operates, we construe it based on the
policy's text, the accompanying forms, and the parties' representations at oral
argument and in their briefs.  The New Policy appears to operate as follows: A
classification review for OSP placement can occur either (1) upon entry into the
prison system if the inmate was convicted of certain offenses, e.g., organized
crime, or (2) during the term of incarceration if an inmate engages in specified
conduct, e.g., leads a prison gang. App. 42-43.  The review process begins when
a prison official prepares a ""Security Designation Long Form"" (Long Form).  Id.,
at 20.  This three-page form details matters such as the inmate's recent
violence, escape attempts, gang affiliation, underlying offense, and other
pertinent details.  Id., at 20, 38-45.

A three-member Classification Committee (Committee) convenes to review the
proposed classification and to hold a hearing.  At least 48 hours before the
hearing, the inmate is provided with written notice summarizing the conduct or
offense triggering  [***186]  the review.  Id., at 22, 58.  At the time of
notice, the inmate also has access to the Long Form, which details why the
review was initiated.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 13-17.  The inmate may attend the
hearing, may ""offer any pertinent information, explanation and/or objections to
[OSP] placement,"" and may submit a written statement.  App. 22.  He may not call
witnesses.

If the Committee does not recommend OSP placement, the process terminates. Id.,
at 62, 65.  See also Brief for Petitioners 9.  If the Committee does recommend
OSP placement, it documents the decision on a ""Classification Committee Report""
(CCR), setting forth ""the nature of the threat the inmate presents and the
committee's reasons for the recommendation,"" App. 64, as well as a summary of
any information  [*217]  presented at the hearing.  Id., at 59-65.  The
Committee sends the completed CCR to the warden of the prison where the inmate
is housed or, in the case of an inmate just entering the prison system, to
another designated official.  Id., at 23.

If, after reviewing the CCR, the warden (or the designated official) disagrees
and concludes that OSP is inappropriate, the process terminates and the inmate
is not placed in OSP.  If the warden agrees, he indicates his approval on the
CCR, provides his reasons, and forwards the annotated [**2391]  CCR to the
Bureau of Classification (Bureau) for a final decision.  Id., at 64.  (The
Bureau is a body of Ohio prison officials vested with final decisionmaking
authority over all Ohio inmate assignments.) The annotated CCR is served upon
the inmate, notifying him of the Classification Committee's and warden's
recommendations and reasons.  Id., at 65.  The inmate has 15 days to file any
objections with the Bureau of Classification. Ibid.

After the 15-day period, the Bureau of Classification reviews the CCR and makes
a final determination.  If it concludes OSP placement is inappropriate, the
process terminates. If the Bureau approves the warden's recommendation, the
inmate is transferred to OSP.  The Bureau's chief notes the reasons for the
decision on the CCR, and the CCR is again provided to the inmate. Ibid.

Inmates assigned to OSP receive another review within 30 days of their arrival.
That review is conducted by a designated OSP staff member, who examines the
inmate's file.  Id., at 25.  If the OSP staff member deems the inmate
inappropriately placed, he prepares a written recommendation to the OSP warden
that the inmate be transferred to a lower security institution.  Brief for
Petitioners 9; App. 25.  If the OSP warden concurs, he forwards that transfer
recommendation to the Bureau of Classification for appropriate action.  If the
inmate is deemed properly placed, he remains in OSP and his placement is
reviewed on at least an annual basis according to the initial three-tier
classification review process outlined above.  Brief for Petitioners 9-10.

[*218]  II

This action began when a class of current and former OSP inmates brought suit
under Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Ohio against various Ohio prison officials.  We
refer to the class of plaintiff inmates, respondents here, collectively as ""the
inmates.""  [***187]  We refer to the prison officials, petitioners here, as
""Ohio.""

The inmates' complaint alleged that Ohio's Old Policy, which was in effect at
the time the suit was brought, violated due process.  In addition the inmates
brought a claim that certain conditions at OSP violated the Eighth Amendment's
ban on cruel and unusual punishments, but that claim was settled in the District
Court.  The extent to which the settlement resolved the practices that were the
subject of the inmates' Eighth Amendment claim is unclear but, in any event,
that issue is not before us.  The inmates' suit sought declaratory and
injunctive relief.  On the eve of trial Ohio promulgated its New Policy and
represented that it contained the procedures to be followed in the future.  The
District Court and Court of Appeals evaluated the adequacy of the New Policy,
and it therefore forms the basis for our determination here.

After an 8-day trial with extensive evidence, including testimony from expert
witnesses, the District Court made findings and conclusions and issued a
detailed remedial order.  First, relying on this Court's decision in  Sandin v.
Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293 (1995), the District
Court found that the inmates have a liberty interest in avoiding assignment to
OSP.   Austin I, 189 F. Supp. 2d, at 738-740.  Second, the District Court found
Ohio had denied the inmates due process by failing to afford a large number of
them notice and an adequate opportunity to be heard before transfer; failing to
give inmates sufficient notice of the grounds serving as the basis for their
retention at OSP; and failing to give the inmates sufficient opportunity to
[**2392]  understand the reasoning and evidence  [*219]  used to retain them at
OSP.   Id., at 749.  Third, the District Court held that, although Ohio's New
Policy provided more procedural safeguards than its Old Policy, it was
nonetheless inadequate to meet procedural due process requirements.   Id., at
736, 750-754.  In a separate order it directed extensive modifications to that
policy.   204 F. Supp. 2d 1024 (ND Ohio 2002).

The modifications the District Court ordered to Ohio's New Policy included both
substantive and procedural reforms.  The former narrowed the grounds that Ohio
could consider in recommending assignment to OSP.  For instance, possession of
drugs in small amounts, according to the District Court, could not serve as the
basis for an OSP assignment.   Id., at 1028.  The following are some of the
procedural modifications the District Court ordered:

(1) Finding that the notice provisions of Ohio's New Policy were inadequate, the
District Court ordered Ohio to provide the inmates with an exhaustive list of
grounds believed to justify placement at OSP and a summary of all evidence upon
which the Classification Committee would rely.  Matters not so identified, the
District Court ordered, could not be considered by the Committee.   Id., at 1026
.

(2) The District Court supplemented the inmate's opportunity to appear before
the Committee and to make an oral or written statement by ordering Ohio to allow
inmates to present documentary evidence and call witnesses before the Committee,
provided that doing so would not be unduly hazardous or burdensome.  The
District Court further ordered that Ohio must attempt to secure the  [***188]
participation of any witness housed within the prison system.  Id., at 1026-1027
.

(3) Finding the New Policy's provision of a brief statement of reasons for a
recommendation of OSP placement inadequate, the District Court ordered the
Classification Committee to summarize all evidence supporting its
recommendation.  Id., at 1027.  Likewise, the District Court ordered the Bureau
of Classification to prepare a ""detailed and specific"" statement ""set[ting]
[*220]  out all grounds"" justifying OSP placement including ""facts relied upon
and reasoning used.""  Id., at 1027.  The statement shall ""not use conclusory,""
""vague,"" or ""boilerplate language,"" and must be delivered to the inmate within
five days.   Id., at 1027-1028.

(4) The District Court supplemented the New Policy's 30-day and annual review
processes, ordering Ohio to notify the inmate twice per year both in writing and
orally of his progress toward a security level reduction.  Specifically, that
notice must ""advise the inmate what specific conduct is necessary for that
prisoner to be reduced from Level 5 and the amount of time it will take before
[Ohio] reduces the inmate's security level classification."" Ibid.

Ohio appealed.  First, it maintained that the inmates lacked a constitutionally
protected liberty interest in avoiding placement at OSP.  Second, it argued
that, even assuming a liberty interest, its New Policy provides constitutionally
adequate procedures and thus the District Court's modifications were
unnecessary.  The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District
Court's conclusion that the inmates had a liberty interest in avoiding placement
at OSP.   372 F.3d 346, 356 (2004).  The Court of Appeals also affirmed the
District Court's procedural modifications in their entirety.   Id., at 359-360.
Finally, it set aside the District Court's far-reaching substantive
modifications, concluding they exceeded the scope of the District Court's
authority.  This last [**2393]  aspect of the Court of Appeals' ruling is not
the subject of review in this Court.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR3A]  We granted certiorari to consider what process an
inmate must be afforded under the Due Process Clause when he is considered for
placement at OSP.   543 U.S. ___, 543 U.S. 1032, 160 L. Ed. 2d 518, 125 S. Ct.
686 (2004).  For reasons discussed below, we conclude that the inmates have a
protected liberty interest in avoiding assignment at OSP.  We further hold that
the procedures set forth in the New Policy are sufficient to satisfy the
Constitution's requirements; it follows, then, that the procedural modifications
[*221]  ordered by the District Court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals were
in error.

III

Withdrawing from the position taken in the Court of Appeals, Ohio in its briefs
to this Court conceded that the inmates have a liberty interest in avoiding
assignment at OSP.  See Pet. for Cert. i; Brief for Petitioners i.  The United
States, supporting Ohio as amicus curiae, disagrees with Ohio's concession and
argues that the inmates have no liberty interest in avoiding assignment to a
prison facility with more restrictive conditions of confinement. See Brief for
United States 10.  At oral argument Ohio initially adhered to its earlier
concession, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 5, but when pressed, the State backtracked.
See id., at 6-7.  We need  [***189]  reach the question of what process is due
only if the inmates establish a constitutionally protected liberty interest, so
it is appropriate to address this threshold question at the outset.

[HN1]  [***LEdHR4] [4] The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause protects
persons against deprivations of life, liberty, or property; and those who seek
to invoke its procedural protection must establish that one of these interests
is at stake.  A liberty interest may arise from the Constitution itself, by
reason of guarantees implicit in the word ""liberty,"" see, e.g.,  Vitek v. Jones,
445 U.S. 480, 493-494, 63 L. Ed. 2d 552, 100 S. Ct. 1254 (1980) (liberty
interest in avoiding involuntary psychiatric treatment and transfer to mental
institution), or it may arise from an expectation or interest created by state
laws or policies, see, e.g.,  Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 556-558, 41 L.
Ed. 2d 935, 94 S. Ct. 2963 (1974) (liberty interest in avoiding withdrawal of
state-created system of good-time credits).

We have held that  [HN2] the Constitution itself does not give rise to a liberty
interest in avoiding transfer to more adverse conditions of confinement.
Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 225, 49 L. Ed. 2d 451, 96 S. Ct. 2532 (1976) (no
liberty interest arising from Due Process Clause itself in transfer from low- to
maximum-security  [*222]  prison because ""[c]onfinement in any of the State's
institutions is within the normal limits or range of custody which the
conviction has authorized the State to impose"").  We have also held, however,
that a liberty interest in avoiding particular conditions of confinement may
arise from state policies or regulations, subject to the important limitations
set forth in  Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293
(1995).

[***LEdHR5] [5] Sandin involved prisoners' claims to procedural due process
protection before placement in segregated confinement for 30 days, imposed as
discipline for disruptive behavior.  Sandin observed that some of our earlier
cases,  Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 74 L. Ed. 2d 675, 103 S. Ct. 864 (1983),
in particular, had employed a methodology for identifying state-created liberty
interests that emphasized ""the language of a particular [prison] regulation""
instead of ""the nature of the deprivation.""  Sandin, 515 U.S., at 481, 132 L.
Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293.  In Sandin, we criticized this methodology as
creating a disincentive for States to promulgate [**2394]  procedures for prison
management, and as involving the federal courts in the day-to-day management of
prisons.  Id., at 482-483, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293.  For these
reasons, we abrogated the methodology of parsing the language of particular
regulations.


     ""[T]he search for a negative implication from mandatory language in
     prisoner regulations has strayed from the real concerns undergirding
     the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.  The time has come to
     return to the due process principles we believe were correctly
     established in and applied in Wolff and Meachum. Following Wolff, we
     recognize that  [HN3] States may under certain circumstances create
     liberty interests which are protected by the Due Process Clause.  But
     these interests will generally be limited to freedom from restraint
     which, while not exceeding the sentence in such an unexpected manner
     as to give rise to protection by the Due Process  [***190]  Clause of
     its own force, nonetheless imposes atypical and significant hardship
     on the inmate in relation  [*223]  to the ordinary incidents of prison
     life.""  Id., at 483-484, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293 (citations
     and footnote omitted).



After Sandin, it is clear that  [HN4] the touchstone of the inquiry into the
existence of a protected, state-created liberty interest in avoiding restrictive
conditions of confinement is not the language of regulations regarding those
conditions but the nature of those conditions themselves ""in relation to the
ordinary incidents of prison life.""  Id., at 484, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct.
2293.

Applying this refined inquiry, Sandin found no liberty interest protecting
against a 30-day assignment to segregated confinement because it did not
""present a dramatic departure from the basic conditions of [the inmate's]
sentence.""  Id., at 485, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293.  We noted, for
example, that inmates in the general population experienced ""significant amounts
of 'lockdown time'"" and that the degree of confinement in disciplinary
segregation was not excessive.   Id., at 486, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293
.  We did not find, moreover, the short duration of segregation to work a major
disruption in the inmate's environment.  Ibid.

[***LEdHR3A]  The Sandin standard requires us to determine if assignment to OSP
""imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the
ordinary incidents of prison life.""  Id., at 484, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct.
2293.  In Sandin's wake the Courts of Appeals have not reached consistent
conclusions for identifying the baseline from which to measure what is atypical
and significant in any particular prison system. Compare e.g.,  Beverati v.
Smith, 120 F.3d 500, 504 (CA4 1997), and  Keenan v. Hall, 83 F.3d 1083, 1089
(CA9 1996), with  Hatch v. District of Columbia, 337 U.S. App. D.C. 266, 184
F.3d 846, 847 (CADC 1999).  See also  Wagner v. Hanks, 128 F.3d 1173, 1177 (CA7
1997).  This divergence indicates the difficulty of locating the appropriate
baseline, an issue that was not explored at length in the briefs.  We need not
resolve the issue here, however, for we are satisfied that assignment to OSP
imposes an atypical and significant hardship under any plausible baseline.

For an inmate placed in OSP, almost all human contact is prohibited, even to the
point that conversation is not permitted  [*224]  from cell to cell; the light,
though it may be dimmed, is on for 24 hours; exercise is for 1 hour per day, but
only in a small indoor room.  Save perhaps for the especially severe limitations
on all human contact, these conditions likely would apply to most solitary
confinement facilities, but here there are two added components.  First is the
duration.  Unlike the 30-day placement in Sandin, placement at OSP is indefinite
and, after an initial 30-day review,  [**2395]  is reviewed just annually.
Second is that placement disqualifies an otherwise eligible inmate for parole
consideration.   Austin I, 189 F. Supp. 2d, at 728.  While any of these
conditions standing alone might not be sufficient to create a liberty interest,
taken together they impose an atypical and significant hardship within the
correctional context.  It follows that respondents have a liberty interest in
avoiding assignment to OSP.   Sandin, supra, at 483, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S.
Ct. 2293.

[***191]  OSP's harsh conditions may well be necessary and appropriate in light
of the danger that high-risk inmates pose both to prison officials and to other
prisoners.  See infra, 545 U.S. 209, 227, 125 S. Ct. 2384, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at
192-193.  That necessity, however, does not diminish our conclusion that the
conditions give rise to a liberty interest in their avoidance.

IV

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR6] [6]  [***LEdHR7] [7] A liberty interest having been
established, we turn to the question of what process is due an inmate whom Ohio
seeks to place in OSP.   [HN5] Because the requirements of due process are
""flexible and cal[l] for such procedural protections as the particular situation
demands,""  Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484, 92 S. Ct.
2593 (1972), we generally have declined to establish rigid rules and instead
have embraced a framework to evaluate the sufficiency of particular procedures.
The framework, established in  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 47 L. Ed. 2d
18, 96 S. Ct. 893 (1976), requires consideration of three distinct factors:


     ""First, the private interest that will be affected by the official
     action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation  [*225]  of such
     interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any,
     of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the
     Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal
     and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute
     procedural requirement would entail.""  Id., at 335, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18,
     96 S. Ct. 893.



The Court of Appeals upheld the District Court's procedural modifications under
the assumption that Sandin altered the first Mathews factor.  It reasoned that,
""[i]n this first factor, Sandin affects the due process balance: because only
those conditions that constitute 'atypical and significant hardships' give rise
to liberty interests, those interests will necessarily be of a weight requiring
greater due process protection.""  372 F.3d at 358-359.  This proposition does
not follow from Sandin.  Sandin concerned only whether a state-created liberty
interest existed so as to trigger Mathews balancing at all.  Having found no
liberty interest to be at stake, Sandin had no occasion to consider whether the
private interest was weighty vis-a-vis the remaining Mathews factors.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR8] [8] Applying the three factors set forth in Mathews,
we find Ohio's New Policy provides a sufficient level of process.  We first
consider the significance of the inmate's interest in avoiding erroneous
placement at OSP.  Prisoners held in lawful confinement have their liberty
curtailed by definition, so the procedural protections to which they are
entitled are more limited than in cases where the right at stake is the right to
be free from confinement at all.  See, e.g.,  Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 43
L. Ed. 2d 54, 95 S. Ct. 854 (1975);  Wolff, 418 U.S. 539, 41 L. Ed. 2d 935, 94
S. Ct. 2963.  The private interest at stake here, while more than minimal, must
be evaluated, nonetheless, within the context of the prison system and its
attendant curtailment of liberties.

[***LEdHR9] [9] The second factor addresses the risk of an erroneous placement
under the procedures in place, and the probable value, if any, of additional or
alternative procedural [**2396]  safeguards.  [***192]  The New Policy provides
that an inmate must receive notice  [*226]  of the factual basis leading to
consideration for OSP placement and a fair opportunity for rebuttal.  Our
procedural due process cases have consistently observed that these are among the
most important procedural mechanisms for purposes of avoiding erroneous
deprivations.  See  Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correctional
Complex, 442 U.S. 1, 15, 60 L. Ed. 2d 668, 99 S. Ct. 2100 (1979);  Cleveland Bd.
of Ed. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 543, 84 L. Ed. 2d 494, 105 S. Ct. 1487
(1985);  Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 80, 32 L. Ed. 2d 556, 92 S. Ct. 1983
(1972) (""For more than a century  [HN6] the central meaning of procedural due
process has been clear: 'Parties whose rights are to be affected are entitled to
be heard; and in order that they may enjoy that right they must first be
notified'"" (quoting  Baldwin v. Hale, 68 U.S. 223, 1 Wall. 223, 233, 17 L. Ed.
531 (1864))).  Requiring officials to provide a brief summary of the factual
basis for the classification review and allowing the inmate a rebuttal
opportunity safeguards against the inmate's being mistaken for another or
singled out for insufficient reason.  In addition to having the opportunity to
be heard at the Classification Committee stage, Ohio also invites the inmate to
submit objections prior to the final level of review.  This second opportunity
further reduces the possibility of an erroneous deprivation.

Although a subsequent reviewer may overturn an affirmative recommendation for
OSP placement, the reverse is not true; if one reviewer declines to recommend
OSP placement, the process terminates. This avoids one of problems apparently
present under the Old Policy, where, even if two levels of reviewers recommended
against placement, a later reviewer could overturn their recommendation without
explanation.

If the recommendation is OSP placement, Ohio requires that the decisionmaker
provide a short statement of reasons.  This requirement guards against arbitrary
decisionmaking while also providing the inmate a basis for objection before the
next decisionmaker or in a subsequent classification review.  The statement also
serves as a guide for future behavior.  See  Greenholtz, supra, at 16, 60 L. Ed.
2d 668, 99 S. Ct. 2100.

[*227]  As we have noted, Ohio provides multiple levels of review for any
decision recommending OSP placement, with power to overturn the recommendation
at each level.  In addition to these safeguards, Ohio further reduces the risk
of erroneous placement by providing for a placement review within 30 days "

 [*195]  [**2376]    Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A]  This case presents the question whether uses of patented
inventions in preclinical research, the results of which are not ultimately
included in a submission to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), are exempted
from infringement by 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(1).

I

[HN1] It is generally an act of patent infringement to ""mak[e], us[e], offe[r]
to sell, or sel[l] any patented invention . . . during [**2377]  the term of the
patent therefor."" § 271(a).  In 1984, Congress enacted an exemption to this
general rule, see Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of
1984, § 202, 98 Stat. 1585, as amended, 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(1), which provides:


      [HN2] ""It shall not be an act of infringement to make, use, offer to
     sell, or sell within the United States or  [***166]  import into the
     United States a patented invention (other than a new animal drug or
     veterinary biological product (as those terms are used in the Federal
     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Act of March 4, 1913)) solely for
     uses reasonably related to the development and submission of
     information under a Federal law which regulates the manufacture, use,
     or sale of drugs . . . .""



 [*196]   [HN3]  The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), ch. 675, 52
Stat. 1040, as amended, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq, is ""a Federal law which
regulates the manufacture, use, or sale of drugs."" See 21 U.S.C. § 355(a);  Eli
Lilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc., 496 U.S. 661, 665-666, 674, 110 L. Ed. 2d 605,
110 S. Ct. 2683 (1990).  Under the FDCA, a drugmaker must submit research data
to the FDA at two general stages of new- drug development. 1 First, a drugmaker
must gain authorization to conduct clinical trials (tests on humans) by
submitting an investigational new drug application (IND).  See 21 U.S.C. §
355(i); 21 CFR § 312.1 et seq. (2005). 2 The IND must describe ""preclinical
tests (including tests on animals) of [the] drug adequate to justify the
proposed clinical testing."" 21 U.S.C. § 355(i)(1)(A); see 21 CFR §§ 312.23(a)(5)
and (a)(8) (specifying necessary information from preclinical tests).  Second,
to obtain authorization to market a new drug, a drugmaker must submit a new drug
application (NDA), containing ""full reports of investigations which have been
made to show whether or not [the] drug is safe for use and whether [the] drug is
effective in use."" 21 U.S.C. § 355(b)(1).  Pursuant to FDA regulations, the NDA
must include all clinical studies, as well as preclinical studies related to a
drug's efficacy, toxicity, and pharmacological properties.  See 21 CFR §§
314.50(d)(2) (preclinical studies) and (d)(5) (clinical studies).

Respondents Integra Lifesciences I, Ltd., and the Burnham Institute, own five
patents related to the tripeptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp, known in single-letter
notation as the ""RGD peptide."" U.S. Patent Nos.  4,988,621, 4,792,525,
5,695,997, 4,879,237, and 4,789,734, Supp. App. SA11-SA19.  The RGD peptide
promotes cell adhesion by attaching to [alpha] [nu] [beta] <3> integrins,
receptors commonly located on the outer surface of certain endothelial cells.
331 F.3d 860, 862-863 (CA Fed. 2003).

Beginning in 1988, petitioner Merck KGaA provided funding for angiogenesis
research conducted by Dr. David Cheresh at the Scripps Research Institute
(Scripps).   [**2378]   Telios Pharms., Inc. v. Merck KGaA, 1997 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 24187, Case No. 96-CV-1307 (SD Cal., Sept. 9, 1997), App. 30a.
Angiogenesis is the process by which  [***167]  new blood vessels sprout from
existing vessels; it plays a critical role in many diseases, including solid
tumor cancers, diabetic retinopathy, and rheumatoid arthritis.   331 F.3d, at
863.  In the course of his research, Dr. Cheresh discovered that it was possible
to inhibit angiogenesis by blocking the [alpha] [nu] [beta] <3> integrins on
proliferating endothelial cells.  Ibid. In 1994, Dr. Cheresh succeeded in
reversing tumor growth in chicken embryos, first using a monoclonal antibody
(LM609) he developed himself and later using a cyclic RGD peptide (EMD 66203)
provided by petitioner. 3 App. 190a.  Dr. Cheresh's discoveries were announced
in leading medical journals and received attention in the general media.  See

3 In the proceedings below, the Court of Appeals held that respondents' patents
covered the cyclic RGD peptides developed by petitioner.   331 F.3d 860, 869 (CA

 With petitioner's agreement to fund research at Scripps due to expire in July
1995, Dr. Cheresh submitted a detailed proposal for expanded collaboration
between Scripps and petitioner on February 1, 1995.  App. 95a-107a.  The
proposal set forth a 3-year timetable in which to develop ""integrin antagonists
as angiogenesis inhibitors,"" id., at 105a, beginning with in vitro and in vivo
testing of RGD peptides at Scripps in year one and culminating with the
submission of an IND to the FDA in year three, id., at 106a-107a.  Petitioner
agreed to the material terms of the proposal on February 20, 1995, id., at
124a-125a, and on April 13, 1995, pledged $6 million over three years to fund
research at Scripps, id., at 126a.  Petitioner's April 13 letter specified that
Scripps would be responsible for testing RGD peptides produced by petitioner as
potential drug candidates but that, once a primary  candidate for clinical
testing was in ""the pipeline,"" petitioner would perform the toxicology tests
necessary for FDA approval to proceed to clinical trials.  Id., at 127a; see 21
CFR § 312.23(a)(8)(iii) (2005) (requirement that ""nonclinical laboratory study""
include a certification that it was performed under good laboratory practices);
see also § 58.3(d) (2004) (defining ""[n]onclinical laboratory study"").  Scripps
and petitioner concluded an agreement of continued collaboration in September
1995.  Case No. 96-CV-1307, App. 31a.

Pursuant to the agreement, Dr. Cheresh directed in vitro and in vivo experiments
on RGD peptides provided by petitioner from 1995 to 1998.  These experiments
focused on EMD 66203 and two closely related derivatives, EMD 85189 and EMD
121974, and were designed to evaluate the suitability of each of the peptides as
potential drug candidates.  331 F.3d, at 863.  Accordingly, the tests measured
the efficacy,  [*199]  specificity, and toxicity of the particular peptides as
angiogenesis inhibitors, and evaluated their mechanism of action and
pharmacokinetics in animals.  Ibid. Based on the test results, Scripps decided
in 1997 that EMD 121974 was the most promising  [***168]  candidate for testing
in humans.  Ibid. Over the same period, Scripps performed similar tests on
LM609, a monoclonal antibody developed by Dr. Cheresh. 4 [**2379]  App. 277a,
285a-298a.  Scripps also conducted more basic research on organic mimetics
designed to block [alpha] [nu] [beta] <3>  integrins in a manner similar to the
RGD peptides, id., at 223a-224a; it appears that Scripps used the RGD peptides
in these tests as ""positive controls"" against which to measure the efficacy of
the mimetics, id., at 188a.

4 Scripps licensed the patent for the monoclonal antibody to Ixsys, a California
biotechnology company.  App. 271a.  Based on research conducted at Scripps and
at Ixsys in consultation with Dr. Cheresh, an IND application for a humanized
version of the antibody called Vitaxin was filed with the FDA on December 30,
1996.  Id., at 271a-274a, 404a.  In addition to toxicology tests, the
application included information from Dr. Cheresh's in vitro and in vivo
experiments related to the antibody's mechanism of action and efficacy as an
inhibitor of angiogenesis. Id., at 399a-404a.  Ixsys began clinical testing of
the antibody as an angiogenesis inhibitor in February 1997.  Id., at 304a.

In November 1996, petitioner initiated a formal project to guide one of its RGD
peptides through the regulatory approval process in the United States and
Europe.  Id., at 129a.  Petitioner originally directed its efforts at EMD 85189,
but switched focus in April 1997 to EMD 121974.  Case No. 96-CV-1307, App. 31a.
Petitioner subsequently discussed EMD 121974 with officials at the FDA.  Id., at
397a.  In October 1998, petitioner shared its research on RGD peptides with the
National Cancer Institute (NCI), which agreed to sponsor clinical trials.  Id.,
at 214a-217a.  Although the fact was excluded from evidence at trial, the lower
court's opinion reflects that NCI filed an IND for EMD 121974 in 1998.   331

On July 18, 1996, respondents filed a patent-infringement suit against
petitioner, Scripps, and Dr. Cheresh in the District Court for the Southern
District of California.  Respondents' complaint alleged that petitioner
willfully infringed and induced others to infringe respondents' patents by
supplying the RGD peptide to Scripps, and that Dr. Cheresh and Scripps infringed
the same patents by using the RGD peptide in experiments related to
angiogenesis. Respondents sought damages from petitioner and a declaratory
judgment against Dr. Cheresh and Scripps.   Id., at 863.  Petitioner answered
that its actions involving the RGD peptides did not infringe respondents'
patents, and that in any event they were protected by the common-law research
exemption and 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(1).   331 F.3d, at 863.

At the conclusion of trial, the District Court held that, with one exception,
petitioner's pre-1995 actions related to the RGD peptides were protected by the
common-law research exemption, but that a question of fact remained as to
whether petitioner's use of the RGD peptides after 1995 fell within the §
271(e)(1) safe harbor. With the consent of the parties, the District Court gave
the following instruction regarding the § 271(e)(1) exemption:


     ""To prevail on this defense, [petitioner] must prove by a
     preponderance of the evidence that it would be objectively reasonable
     for a party in [petitioner's] and Scripps' situation to believe that
     there was a decent prospect that the accused  [***169]  activities
     would contribute, relatively directly, to the  generation of the kinds
     of information that are likely to be relevant in the processes by
     which the FDA would decide whether to approve the product in question.

     ""Each of the accused activities must be evaluated separately to
     determine whether the exemption applies.

     [*201]  ""[Petitioner] does not need to show that the information
     gathered from a particular activity was actually submitted  [**2380]
     to the FDA."" App. 57a.



The jury found that petitioner, Dr. Cheresh, and Scripps infringed respondents'
patents and that petitioner had failed to show that its activities were
protected by § 271(e)(1).  It awarded damages of $15 million.

In response to post-trial motions, the District Court dismissed respondents'
suit against Dr. Cheresh and Scripps, but affirmed the jury's damages award as
supported by substantial evidence, Civ. Action No. 961307 JMF (SD Cal. Mar. 26,
2001), App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a, and denied petitioner's motion for judgment
as a matter of law, Civ. Action No. 96CV-1307 JMF (SD Cal., Mar. 6, 2001), App.
to Pet. for Cert. 50a.  With respect to the last, the District Court explained
that the evidence was sufficient to show that ""any connection between the
infringing Scripps experiments and FDA review was insufficiently direct to
qualify for the [§ 271(e)(1) exemption]. "" Id., at 49a.

A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed in
part, and reversed in part.  The panel majority affirmed the denial of judgment
as a matter of law to petitioner, on the ground that § 271(e)(1)'s safe harbor
did not apply because ""the Scripps work sponsored by [petitioner] was not
clinical testing to supply information to the FDA, but only general biomedical
research to identify new pharmaceutical compounds.""  331 F.3d, at 866.  It
reversed the District Court's refusal to modify the damages award, and remanded
for further proceedings. 5  Id., at 872.  Judge Newman dissented on both points.
See  id., at 874, 877.  The panel unanimously affirmed the District Court's
ruling  [*202]  that respondents' patents covered the cyclic RGD peptides
developed by petitioner.   Id., at 868-869;  id., at 873, n. 7 (Newman, J.,
dissenting).  We granted certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' construction
of § 271(e)(1).   543 U.S. ___, 543 U.S. 1041, 160 L. Ed. 2d 609, 125 S. Ct. 823

As described earlier,  [HN5] 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(1) provides that ""[i]t shall not
be an act of infringement to . . . use . . . or import into the United States a
patented invention . . . solely for uses reasonably related to the development
and submission of information under a Federal law which regulates the . . . use
. . . of drugs."" Though the contours of this provision are not exact in every
respect, the statutory text makes clear that it provides a wide berth for the
use of patented drugs in activities related to the federal regulatory process.

[***LEdHR2] [2] As an initial matter, we think  [HN6] it apparent from the
statutory text  [***170]  that § 271(e)(1)'s exemption from infringement extends
to all uses of patented inventions that are reasonably related to the
development and submission of any information under the FDCA.  Cf.  Eli Lilly,
496 U.S., at 665-669, 110 L. Ed. 2d 605, 110 S. Ct. 2683 (declining to limit §
271(e)(1)'s exemption from infringement to submissions under particular
statutory provisions that regulate drugs).  This necessarily includes
preclinical studies of patented compounds that are appropriate for submission to
the FDA in the regulatory process.  There is simply no room in the statute for
excluding certain information from the exemption on the basis of the phase of
research in which it is developed or the particular submission in which it could
be included. 6

6 Although the Court of Appeals' opinion suggests in places that § 271(e)(1)'s
exemption from infringement is limited to research conducted in clinical trials,
see  331 F.3d at 866, we do not understand it to have adopted that position.
The Court of Appeals recognized that information included in an IND would come
within § 271(e)(1)'s safe harbor. Ibid. Because an IND must be filed before
clinical trials may begin, such information would necessarily be developed in
preclinical studies.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 [*203]  [**2381]    [***LEdHR3] [3] Respondents concede the breadth of §
271(e)(1) in this regard, but argue that the only preclinical data of interest
to the FDA is that which pertains to the safety of the drug in humans.  In
respondents' view, preclinical studies related to a drug's efficacy, mechanism
of action, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacology are not reasonably included in an
IND or  an NDA, and are therefore outside the scope of the exemption.  [HN7] We
do not understand the FDA's interest in information gathered in preclinical
studies to be so constrained.  To be sure, its regulations provide that the
agency's ""primary objectives in reviewing an IND are . . . to assure the safety
and rights of subjects,"" 21 CFR 312.22(a) (2005), but it does not follow that
the FDA is not interested in reviewing information related to other
characteristics of a drug.  To the contrary, the FDA requires that applicants
include in an IND summaries of the pharmacological, toxicological,
pharmacokinetic, and biological qualities of the drug in animals. See §
312.23(a)(5); Department of Health and Human Services, Guidance for Industry,
Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance 45 (Apr. 1996) (""The results of
all relevant nonclinical pharmacology, toxicology, pharmacokinetic, and
investigational product metabolism studies should be provided in summary form.
This summary should address the methodology used, the results, and a discussion
of the relevance of the findings to the investigated therapeutic and the
possible unfavorable and unintended effects in humans"").  The primary (and, in
some cases, only) way in which a drugmaker may obtain such information is
through preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies.

Moreover,  [HN8] the FDA does not evaluate the safety of proposed clinical
experiments in a vacuum; rather, as the statute and regulations reflect, it asks
whether the proposed clinical trial poses an ""unreasonable risk."" 21 U.S.C. §
355(i)(3)(B)(i); see also 21 CFR § 312.23(a)(8) (2005) (requiring applicants to
include pharmacological and toxicological studies that serve as the basis of
their conclusion that clinical  [*204]  testing would be ""reasonably safe""); §
56.111(a)(2) (2004)  [***171]  (providing that the Institutional Review Boards
that oversee clinical trials must consider whether the ""[r]isks to subjects are
reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits"").  This assessment involves a
comparison of the risks and the benefits associated with the proposed clinical
trials.  As the Government's brief, filed on behalf of the FDA, explains, the
""FDA might allow clinical testing of a drug that posed significant safety
concerns if the drug had a sufficiently positive potential to address a serious
disease, although the agency would not accept similar risks for a drug that was
less likely to succeed or that would treat a less serious medical condition.""
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 10.  Accordingly, the FDA directs that
an IND must provide sufficient information for the investigator to ""make his/her
own unbiased risk-benefit assessment of the appropriateness of the proposed
trial."" Guidance for Industry, supra, at 43.  Such information necessarily
includes preclinical studies of a drug's efficacy in achieving particular
results.

[***LEdHR4] [4] Respondents contend that, even accepting that the FDA is
interested in preclinical research concerning drug characteristics other than
safety, the experiments in question here are necessarily [**2382]  disqualified
because they were not conducted in conformity with the FDA's good laboratory
practices regulations. This argument fails for at least two reasons.  First,
[HN9] the FDA's requirement that preclinical studies be conducted under ""good
laboratory practices"" applies only to experiments on drugs ""to determine their
safety,"" 21 CFR § 58.3(d).  See 21 CFR § 58.1(a); § 312.23(a)(8)(iii) (2005)
(only ""nonclinical laboratory study subject to the good laboratory practice
regulations under part 58"" must certify compliance with good laboratory practice
regulations).  The good laboratory practice regulations do not apply to
preclinical studies of a drug's efficacy, mechanism of action, pharmacology, or
pharmacokinetics. Second, FDA regulations do not provide that even
safety-related experiments not conducted in compliance  [*205]  with good
laboratory practices regulations are not suitable for submission in an IND.
Rather, such studies must include ""a brief statement of the reason for the
noncompliance."" Ibid.

The Court of Appeals' conclusion that § 271(e)(1) did not protect petitioner's
provision of the patented RGD peptides for research at Scripps appeared to rest
on two somewhat related propositions.  First, the court credited the fact that
the ""Scripps-Merck experiments did not supply information for submission to the
[FDA], but instead identified the best drug candidate to subject to future
clinical testing under the FDA processes.""  331 F.3d at 865; see also  id., at
866 (similar).  The court explained:


     ""The FDA has no interest in the hunt for drugs that may or may not
     later undergo clinical testing for FDA approval.  For instance, the
     FDA does not require information about drugs other than the compound
     featured in an [IND] application.  Thus, the Scripps work sponsored by
     [petitioner] was not 'solely for uses reasonably related to' clinical
     testing for FDA."" Ibid.



Second, the court concluded that the exemption ""does not globally embrace all
experimental activity that at some point, however attenuated,  [***172]  may
lead to an FDA approval process.""  Id., at 867. 7

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - Footnotes - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

7 The Court of Appeals also suggested that a limited construction of § 271(e)(1)
is necessary to avoid depriving so-called ""research tools"" of the complete value
of their patents. Respondents have never argued the RGD peptides were used at
Scripps as research tools, and it is apparent from the record that they were
not.  See  331 F.3d at 878 (Newman, J., dissenting) (""Use of an existing tool in
one's research is quite different from study of the tool itself"").  We therefore
need not--and do not--express a view about whether, or to what extent, §
271(e)(1) exempts from infringement the use of ""research tools"" in the
development of information for the regulatory process.

  [***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR5] [5]  [***LEdHR6A]  We do not quibble with the
latter statement.   [HN10] Basic scientific research on a particular compound,
performed without  [*206]  the intent to develop a particular drug or a
reasonable belief that the compound will cause the sort of physiological effect
the researcher intends to induce, is surely not ""reasonably related to the
development and submission of information"" to the FDA.  It does not follow from
this, however, that § 271(e)(1)'s exemption from infringement categorically
excludes either (1) experimentation on drugs that are not ultimately the subject
of an FDA submission or (2) use of patented compounds in experiments that are
not ultimately submitted to the FDA.  Under certain conditions, we think the
exemption is sufficiently broad to protect the use of patented compounds in both
situations.

As to the first proposition, it disregards the reality that, even at late stages
in the development of a new drug, scientific testing is a process of trial and
error.  In the [**2383]  vast majority of cases, neither the drugmaker nor its
scientists have any way of knowing whether an initially promising candidate will
prove successful over a battery of experiments. That is the reason they conduct
the experiments.  Thus, to construe § 271(e)(1), as the Court of Appeals did,
not to protect research conducted on patented compounds for which an IND is not
ultimately filed is effectively to limit assurance of exemption to the
activities necessary to seek approval of a generic drug: One can know at the
outset that a particular compound will be the subject of an eventual application
to the FDA only if the active ingredient in the drug being tested is identical
to that in a drug that has already been approved.

[***LEdHR6A]  The statutory text does not require such a result.   [HN11]
Congress did not limit § 271(e)(1)'s safe harbor to the development of
information for inclusion in a submission to the FDA; nor did it create an
exemption applicable only to the research relevant to filing an ANDA for
approval of a generic drug. Rather, it exempted from infringement all uses of
patented compounds ""reasonably related"" to the process of developing information
for submission under any federal law regulating the manufacture, use, or
distribution of drugs.  See  Eli  [*207]  Lilly, 496 U.S., at 674, 110 L. Ed. 2d
605, 110 S. Ct. 2683.  We decline to read the ""reasonable relation"" requirement
so narrowly as to render § 271(e)(1)'s stated protection of activities leading
to FDA approval for all drugs illusory.  Properly construed, § 271(e)(1) leaves
adequate space for experimentation and failure on the road to regulatory
approval: At least where a drugmaker has a reasonable basis for believing that a
patented compound may work, through a particular biological process, to produce
a particular physiological effect, and uses the compound in research that, if
successful,  [***173]  would be appropriate to include in a submission to the
FDA, that use is ""reasonably related"" to the ""development and submission of
information under . . . Federal law."" § 271(e)(1).

[***LEdHR1A]  For similar reasons,  [HN12] the use of a patented compound in
experiments that are not themselves included in a ""submission of information"" to
the FDA does not, standing alone, render the use infringing.  The relationship
of the use of a patented compound in a particular experiment to the ""development
and submission of information"" to the FDA does not become more attenuated (or
less reasonable) simply because the data from that experiment are left out of
the submission that is ultimately passed along to the FDA.  Moreover, many of
the uncertainties that exist with respect to the selection of a specific drug
exist as well with respect to the decision of what research to include in an IND
or NDA.  As a District Court has observed, ""[I]t will not always be clear to
parties setting out to seek FDA approval for their new product exactly which
kinds of information, and in what quantities, it will take  to win that agency's
approval.""  Intermedics, Inc. v. Ventritex, Inc., 775 F. Supp. 1269, 1280 (ND
Cal. 1991), aff'd,  991 F.2d 808 (CA Fed. 1993).  This is especially true at the
preclinical stage of drug approval.  FDA regulations provide only that ""[t]he
amount of information on a particular drug that must be submitted in an IND . .
. depends upon such factors as the novelty of the drug, the extent to which it
has been studied previously, the known or  [*208]  suspected risks, and the
developmental phase of the drug."" 21 CFR § 312.22(b).  We thus agree with the
Government that  [HN13] the use of patented compounds in preclinical studies is
protected under § 271(e)(1) as long as there is a reasonable basis for believing
that the experiments will produce ""the types of information that are  [**2384]
relevant to an IND or NDA."" Brief of United States as Amicus Curiae 23.

 [***LEdHR7] [7] Before the Court of Appeals, petitioner challenged the
sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury's finding that it failed to show
that ""all of the accused activities are covered by [§ 271(e)(1)]."" App. 62a.
That court rejected the challenge on the basis of a construction of § 271(e)(1)
that was not consistent with the text of that provision or the relevant jury
instruction. 8 Thus, the evidence presented at trial has yet to be reviewed
under the standards set forth in the jury instruction, which we believe to be

adopt today.  We decline to undertake a review of the sufficiency of the

"           AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSOCIATIONS, INC. and USF HOLLAND, INC.,             Petitioners v. MICHIGAN PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION et al.",545 U.S. 429,"

 [*431]  [**2421]   Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A] In this case, we consider whether a flat $100 fee that
Michigan charges trucks engaging in intrastate commercial hauling violates the
dormant Commerce Clause.  We hold that it does not.

[**2422]  I

[HN1] A subsection of Michigan's Motor Carrier Act imposes upon each motor
carrier ""for the administration of this act, an annual fee of $100.00 for each
self-propelled motor vehicle operated by or on behalf of the motor carrier.""
Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 478.2(1) (West 2002).  The provision assesses the fee
upon, and only upon, vehicles that engage in intrastate commercial
operations--that is, on trucks that undertake point-to-point hauls between
Michigan cities.  See Westlake Transp., Inc. v. Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 255
Mich. App. 589, 592-594, 662 N.W.2d 784, 789 (2003).  Petitioners, USF Holland,
Inc., a trucking company with trucks that engage in both interstate and
intrastate hauling, and the American Trucking Associations, Inc. (ATA), asked
the Michigan courts to invalidate the provision.  Both petitioners [*432]  told
those courts that trucks that carry both interstate and intrastate loads engage
in intrastate business less than trucks that confine their operations to the
Great Lakes State.   [***412]  Hence, because Michigan's fee is flat, it
discriminates against interstate carriers and imposes an unconstitutional burden
upon interstate trade.

The Michigan Court of Claims rejected the carriers' claim for three reasons.
First, the $100 fee ""is regulatory and intended"" for the Motor Carrier Act's
administration, which includes ""regulation of vehicular size and weight,
insurance requirements and safety standards."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a.  Such
a fee ""is not amenable to a fee structure based on apportionment by usage
rates."" Ibid. Second, the fee reflects a ""legitimate expression of the [S]tate's
concern that the welfare of its citizens be protected,"" and hence an appropriate
exercise of the State's police power. Ibid. Third, the fee does not implicate
the Commerce Clause because it falls only on intrastate, not interstate,
commerce. Id., at 45a.

The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed.  It did not agree that the intrastate
nature of § 478.2(1) sheltered the fee from Commerce Clause scrutiny.  255 Mich.
App. , at 617-619, 662 N. W. 2d, at 802.  Nonetheless, the court rejected the
truckers' claim because the statute ""regulates evenhandedly,"" id., at 621, 662
N. W. 2d, at 804, and because the record lacked any ""evidence that any trucking
firm's route choices [were] affected by the imposition of the fee,"" id., at 621,
662 N. W. 2d, at 803-804.  Rather, the record indicated that any ""effect . . .
on interstate commerce is incidental,"" rendering the truckers' claim of
discrimination ""a matter of pure speculation."" Ibid.

The Michigan Supreme Court denied petitioners leave to appeal. Westlake Transp.,
Inc. v. Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 469 Mich. 976, 673 N.W.2d 752 (2003).  We
granted their petition for certiorari and consolidated the case with Mid-Con
Freight Systems, Inc. v. Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm'n, post, p. 440, a case in
which interstate truckers  [*433]  sought review of a separate state motor
carrier fee.  We now affirm the Michigan court's judgment sustaining § 478.2(1).

II

[HN2]  [***LEdHR2] [2] Our Constitution ""was framed upon the theory that the
peoples of the several states must sink or swim together.""  Baldwin v. G. A. F.
Seelig, Inc., 294 U.S. 511, 523, 79 L. Ed. 1032, 55 S. Ct. 497 (1935).  Thus,
this Court has consistently held that the Constitution's express grant to
Congress of the power to ""regulate Commerce . . . among the several States,""
Art. I, § 8, cl. 3, contains ""a further, negative command, known as the dormant
Commerce Clause,"" Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Jefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U.S. 175,
179, 131 L. Ed. 2d 261, 115 S. Ct. 1331 (1995), that [**2423]  ""create[s] an
area of trade free from interference by the States,"" Boston Stock Exchange v.
State Tax Comm'n, 429 U.S. 318, 328, 50 L. Ed. 2d 514, 97 S. Ct. 599 (1977)
(internal quotation marks omitted).  This negative command prevents a State from
""jeopardizing the welfare of the Nation as a whole"" by ""plac[ing] burdens on the
flow of commerce across its borders that commerce wholly within those borders
would not bear.""  Jefferson Lines, supra, at 180, 131 L. Ed. 2d 261, 115 S. Ct.
1331.

Thus, we have found unconstitutional state regulations that unjustifiably
discriminate on their face against out-of-state entities, see Philadelphia v.
New Jersey, 437 U.S. 617, 57 L. Ed. 2d 475, 98 S. Ct. 2531  [***413]  (1978), or
that impose burdens on interstate trade that are ""clearly excessive in relation
to the putative local benefits,"" Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137, 142,
25 L. Ed. 2d 174, 90 S. Ct. 844 (1970).  We have held that States may not impose
taxes that facially discriminate against interstate business and offer
commercial advantage to local enterprises, see, e.g., Oregon Waste Sys. v.
Department of Envtl. Quality, 511 U.S. 93, 99-100, 128 L. Ed. 2d 13, 114 S. Ct.
1345 (1994), that improperly apportion state assessments on transactions with
out-of-state components, Central Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Mealey, 334 U.S. 653,
92 L. Ed. 1633, 68 S. Ct. 1260 (1948), or that have the ""inevitable effect [of]
threaten[ing] the free movement of commerce by placing a financial barrier
around the State,"" American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U.S. 266,
284, 97 L. Ed. 2d 226, 107 S. Ct. 2829 (1987).

[*434]   [***LEdHR1A] [1B] Applying these principles and precedents, we find
[HN3] nothing in § 478.2(1) that offends the Commerce Clause.  To begin with,
Michigan imposes the flat $100 fee only upon intrastate transactions--that is,
upon activities taking place exclusively within the State's borders. Section
478.2(1) does not facially discriminate against interstate or out-of-state
activities or enterprises.  The statute applies evenhandedly to all carriers
that make domestic journeys.  It does not reflect an effort to tax activity that
takes place, in whole or in part, outside the State.  Nothing in our case law
suggests that such a neutral, locally focused fee or tax is inconsistent with
the dormant Commerce Clause.

This legal vacuum is not surprising.  States impose numerous flat fees upon
local businesses and service providers, including, for example, upon insurers,
auctioneers, ambulance operators, and hosts of others.  See, e.g., Wyo. Stat. §
33-36-104 (Lexis 2003); S. C. Code Ann. § 38-7-10 (West 2002).   [HN4] Although
we have ""long since rejected any suggestion that a state tax . . . affecting
interstate commerce is immune from Commerce Clause scrutiny because it attaches
only to a 'local' or intrastate activity,"" Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana,
453 U.S. 609, 615, 69 L. Ed. 2d 884, 101 S. Ct. 2946 (1981), we have also made
clear that the Constitution neither displaces States' authority ""to shelter
[their] people from menaces to their health or safety,"" D. H. Holmes Co. v.
McNamara, 486 U.S. 24, 29, 100 L. Ed. 2d 21, 108 S. Ct. 1619 (1988) (internal
quotation marks omitted), nor ""unduly curtail[s]"" States' power ""to lay taxes
for the support of state government,"" McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Mining
Co., 309 U.S. 33, 48, 84 L. Ed. 565, 60 S. Ct. 388 (1940).

The record, moreover, shows no special circumstance suggesting that Michigan's
fee operates in practice as anything other than an unobjectionable exercise of
the State's police power. To the contrary, as the Michigan Court of Appeals
pointed out, the record contains little, if any, evidence that the $100 fee
imposes any significant practical burden upon interstate [**2424]  trade. See
255 Mich. App., at 620-622, 662 N. W. 2d [*435]  , at 803-804.  The record does
show, for example,  that some interstate trucks ""top off"" some interstate hauls
with intrastate pickups and deliveries.  See Brief for Intervening
Plaintiffs-Appellants in Nos. 226052, 226122 (Ct. App.  [***414]  Mich.), Exh.
3, Affidavit of James C. Crozier P 7 (licensing and fuel manager of TNT Holland
Motor Express, Inc., describing this practice).  But it does not tell us the
answers to such questions as: How often does ""topping off"" occur across the
industry?  Does the $100 charge make a difference by significantly discouraging
interstate carriers from engaging in ""topping off""?  Does the possibility of
obtaining a 72-hour intrastate permit for $10 alleviate the alleged problem?
See § 478.2(3); see also Brief for Respondents 2, n 3 (4,928 temporary permits
were issued in 2004).  If the fees ($100 and $10) discourage ""topping off,"" does
that local commercial effect make a significant interstate difference?  Would a
variable fee (of the kind the truckers advocate) eliminate such difference?  The
minimal facts in the record tell us little about these matters.  Compare App.
60-61, Supplemental Affidavit of Thomas R. Lonergan P 10(e) (official of the
Michigan Public Service Commission stating that topping off is rare for most
interstate carriers because it disrupts schedules and shipping patterns), with
Reply Brief for Intervening Plaintiffs-Appellants in Nos. 226122, 226137 (Ct.
App. Mich.), Exh. A, Supplemental Affidavit of James C. Crozier P 6 (TNT Holland
frequently tops off interstate loads).  And at oral argument, ATA conceded the
absence of record facts that empirically could show that the $100 fee
significantly deters interstate trade. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5.

Neither does the record show that the flat assessment unfairly discriminates
against interstate truckers. The fee seeks to defray costs such as those of
regulating ""vehicular size and weight,"" of administering ""insurance
requirements,"" and of applying ""safety standards."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a.
The bulk of such costs would seem more likely to vary per truck or per carrier
than to vary per mile traveled. See [*436]  255 Mich. App. , at 612-617, 662 N.
W. 2d, at 799-801.  And that fact means that a per-truck, rather than a
per-mile, assessment is likely fair.  Cf. Jefferson Lines, 514 U.S., at 199, 131
L. Ed. 2d 261, 115 S. Ct. 1331 (rejecting taxpayer's discrimination claim in
part because ""miles traveled within the State simply are not a relevant proxy
for the benefit conferred upon the parties to a sales transaction"").  Nothing in
the record suggests the contrary.

Nor would an effort to switch the manner of fee assessment--from lump sum to,
for example, miles traveled--be burden free.  The record contains an affidavit,
sworn by a Michigan Public Service Commission official, that states that to
obtain the same revenue (about $3.5 million) through a per-mile fee would
require the State to create a ""data accumulation system"" capable of separating
out intrastate hauls and determining their length, and to develop related
liability, billing, and auditing mechanisms.  App. 64, Second Supplemental
Affidavit of Thomas R. Lonergan P 2.  This affidavit, on its face, suggests that
the game is unlikely to be worth the candle.  While petitioners argue the
contrary, they do not provide the details of their preferred alternative
administrative system nor point to record evidence showing its practicality. See
Jefferson Lines, supra, at 195, 131 L. Ed. 2d 261, 115 S. Ct. 1331 (State is not
required to use a particular apportionment formula just because it may be
""possible"" to do so).

Petitioners insist that they do not  [***415]  need empirically to demonstrate
the existence of a burdensome or discriminatory impact upon interstate trucking,
or (presumably)  [**2425]  the unfairness of the assessment in relation to
defrayed costs, or (presumably) the administrative practicality of the
alternatives.  They say that our earlier case, American Trucking Assns., Inc. v.
Scheiner, 483 U.S. 266, 97 L. Ed. 2d 226, 107 S. Ct. 2829 (1987), requires
invalidation of the $100 flat fee, even in the absence of such proof.  We
disagree.

In Scheiner, this Court invalidated a flat $25 ""marker fee"" and a flat ""axle
tax"" that Pennsylvania levied upon all trucks (interstate and intrastate) that
used its roads, including  [*437]  trucks that merely crossed Pennsylvania's
borders to transport, say, Ohio goods to New Jersey customers.  See id., at
273-275, 97 L. Ed. 2d 226, 107 S. Ct. 2829.  Data showed that the fees imposed a
cost per mile on interstate trucks that was approximately ""five times as heavy
as the cost per mile borne by local trucks.""  Id., at 286, 97 L. Ed. 2d 226, 107
S. Ct. 2829.  The assessments largely helped to raise revenue ""to improve and
maintain [the State's] highways and bridges,"" id., at 270, 97 L. Ed. 2d 226, 107
S. Ct. 2829, thereby helping to cover costs likely to vary significantly with
truck-miles traveled, see ibid.  And the assessments did ""not even purport to
approximate fairly the cost or value of the use of Pennsylvania's roads.""  Id.,
at 290, 97 L. Ed. 2d 226, 107 S. Ct. 2829.  In light of these considerations,
Pennsylvania's lump-sum taxes ""threaten[ed] the free movement of commerce by
placing a financial barrier around the State of Pennsylvania.""  Id., at 284, 97
L. Ed. 2d 226, 107 S. Ct. 2829.  We concluded that ""[i]f each State imposed flat
taxes for the privilege of making commercial entrances into its territory, there
[was] no conceivable doubt that commerce among the States would be deterred.""
Ibid.

The present fee, as we have said, taxes purely local activity; it does not tax
an interstate truck's entry into the State nor does it tax transactions spanning
multiple States.  See 255 Mich. App., at 592-594, 662 N. W. 2d, at 789.  We lack
convincing evidence showing that the tax deters, or for that matter
discriminates against, interstate activities.  See supra, at 434-435, 162 L. Ed.
2d, at 413-414.  Nor is the tax one that, on its face, would seem to call for an
assessment measured per mile rather than per truck. See supra, at 435-436, 162
L. Ed. 2d, at 414.  Consequently, we lack any reason to infer that Michigan's
lump-sum levy erects, as in Scheiner, an impermissible discriminatory roadblock.

Petitioners add that Michigan's fee fails the ""internal consistency"" test--a
test that we have typically used where taxation of interstate transactions is at
issue.  Generally speaking, that test asks, ""What would happen if all States did
the same?"" See, e.g.,  Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U.S. 252, 261, 102 L. Ed. 2d 607,
109 S. Ct. 582 (1989); Jefferson Lines, supra, at 185, 131 L. Ed. 2d 261, 115 S.
Ct. 1331 (test looks to the  [*438]  structure of the tax to see whether its
identical application by every State ""would place interstate commerce at a
disadvantage as compared with commerce intrastate"").  We must concede that here,
as petitioners argue, if all States did the same, an interstate truck would have
to pay fees totaling several hundred dollars, or even several thousand dollars,
were  [***416]  it to ""top off"" its business by carrying local loads in many (or
even all) other States.  But it would have to do so only because it engages in
local business in all those States.  An interstate firm with local outlets
normally expects to pay local fees that are uniformly assessed upon all those
who engage in local business, interstate and domestic firms alike.  See, e.g.,
Commonwealth Edison, 453 U.S., at 623-624, 69 L. Ed. 2d 884, 101 S. Ct. 2946
[HN5] (dormant Commerce Clause does not seek ""to relieve those engaged in
interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it
increases the cost of doing business"" (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf.
Jefferson Lines, supra, at 187-188, 131 L. Ed. 2d 261, 115 S. Ct. 1331 (in
context of sales tax, ""the  [**2426] Commerce Clause does not forbid the actual
assessment of a succession of taxes by different States on distinct events as
the same tangible object flows along"").  A motor carrier is not special in this
respect.

In sum, petitioners have failed to show that Michigan's fee, which does not seek
to tax a share of interstate transactions, which focuses upon local activity,
and which is assessed evenhandedly, either burdens or discriminates against
interstate commerce, or violates the Commerce Clause in any other relevant way.
See Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U.S. 274, 279, 51 L. Ed. 2d 326,
97 S. Ct. 1076 (1977) (noting that  [HN6] a tax will be sustained where it is
applied to an activity with a ""substantial nexus"" to the taxing State; where, if
applied to interstate activity, it is ""fairly apportioned""; where it does not
discriminate; and where it is ""fairly related to the services provided"").

For these reasons, the judgment of the Michigan Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

CONCUR BY: SCALIA; THOMAS

CONCUR

 [*439]  Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment.

Michigan imposes a flat fee on trucks that engage in purely intrastate
commercial operations.  I agree with the Court that this fee does not violate
the negative Commerce Clause.  Unlike the Court, ante, at 433, 437-438, 162 L.
Ed. 2d, at 412-413, 415-416, I reach that determination without adverting to
various tests from our wardrobe of ever-changing negative Commerce Clause
fashions: the balancing approach from Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137,
25 L. Ed. 2d 174, 90 S. Ct. 844 (1970), the four-factor test from Complete Auto
Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U.S. 274, 51 L. Ed. 2d 326, 97 S. Ct. 1076 (1977),
and the internal-consistency test from cases such as American Trucking Assns.,
Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U.S. 266, 97 L. Ed. 2d 226, 107 S. Ct. 2829 (1987).
Instead, I ask whether the fee ""facially discriminates against interstate
commerce"" and whether it is ""indistinguishable from a type of law previously
held unconstitutional by this Court.""  West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512
U.S. 186, 210, 129 L. Ed. 2d 157, 114 S. Ct. 2205 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring
in judgment).  As the Court correctly concludes, Michigan's fee meets neither of
those conditions.  It does not facially discriminate against interstate
commerce, [***417]  ante, at 434, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 413, and it is
distinguishable from petitioners' best analogue, the fees invalidated in
Scheiner, which applied to interstate trucks even when they engaged in no
intrastate business, ante, at 436-437, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 415. Justice Thomas,
concurring in the judgment.

I would affirm the judgment of the Michigan Court of Appeals because ""'[t]he
negative Commerce Clause has no basis in the text of the Constitution, makes
little sense, and has proved virtually unworkable in application,' Camps
Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison, 520 U.S. 564, 610, 137 L. Ed. 2d
852, 117 S. Ct. 1590 (1997) (Thomas, J., dissenting), and, consequently, cannot
serve as a basis for striking down a state statute.""  Hillside Dairy Inc. v.
Lyons, 539 U.S. 59, 68, 156 L. Ed. 2d 54, 123 S. Ct. 2142 (2003) (Thomas, J.,
concurring in part and dissenting in part).

 [*429]   [**828]  Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A] The question in these consolidated cases is whether the
portion of a money judgment or settlement paid to a plaintiff's attorney under a
contingent-fee agreement is income to the plaintiff under the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. I [26 USCS §§ 1 et seq.].).  The
issue divides the courts of appeals.  In one of the instant cases,  Banks v.
Comm'r, 345 F.3d 373 (2003), the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held the
contingent-fee portion of a litigation recovery is not included [**829]  in the
plaintiff's gross income. The Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Eleventh
Circuits also adhere to this view, relying on the holding, over Judge Wisdom's
dissent, in  Cotnam v. Commissioner, 263 F.2d 119, 125-126 (CA5 1959).
Srivastava v. Commissioner, 220 F.3d 353, 363-365 (CA5 2000);  Foster v. United
States, 249 F.3d 1275, 1279-1280 (CA11 2001).  In the other case under review,
Banaitis v. Comm'r, 340 F.3d 1074 (2003), the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit held that the portion of the recovery paid to the attorney as a
contingent fee is excluded from the plaintiff's gross income if state law gives
the plaintiff's attorney a special property interest in the fee, but not
otherwise.  Six Courts of Appeals have held the entire litigation recovery,
including the portion paid to an attorney as a contingent fee, is income to the
plaintiff.  Some of these Courts of Appeals discuss state law, but little of
their analysis appears to turn on this factor.   Raymond v. United States, 355
F.3d 107, 113-116 (CA2 2004);  Kenseth v. Comm'r, 259 F.3d 881, 883-884 (CA7
2001);  Baylin v. United States, 43 F.3d 1451, 1454-1455 (CA Fed. 1995).
[*430]  Other Courts of Appeals have been explicit that the fee portion of the
recovery is always income to the plaintiff regardless of the nuances of state
law.  O'Brien v. Commissioner, 38 T. C. 707, 712 (1962), aff'd,  319 F.2d 532
(CA3 1963) (per curiam);  Young v. Comm'r, 240 F.3d 369, 377-379 (CA4 2001);
Hukkanen-Campbell v. Comm'r, 274 F.3d 1312, 1313-1314 (CA10 2001).  We granted
certiorari to resolve the conflict.   541 U.S. 958, 541 U.S. 958, 158 L. Ed. 2d
398, 124 S. Ct. 1712 (2004).

We hold that, as a general rule, when a litigant's recovery constitutes income,
the litigant's income includes the portion of the recovery paid to the attorney
as a contingent fee. We reverse the decisions of the Courts of Appeals for the
Sixth and Ninth Circuits.

I

A. Commissioner v Banks

In 1986, respondent John W. Banks, II, was fired from his job as an educational
consultant with the California Department of Education.  He retained an attorney
on a contingent-fee basis and filed a civil suit against the employer in a
United  [***867]  States District Court.  The complaint alleged employment
discrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983 [42 USCS §§ 1981 and
1983], Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e
et seq.[42 USCS §§ 2000e et seq.], and Cal. Govt. Code Ann. § 12965 (West 1986).
The original complaint asserted various additional claims under state law, but
Banks later abandoned these.  After trial commenced in 1990, the parties settled
for $464,000.  Banks paid $150,000 of this amount to his attorney pursuant to
the fee agreement.

Banks did not include any of the $464,000 in settlement proceeds as gross income
in his 1990 federal income tax return.  In 1997 the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue issued Banks a notice of deficiency for the 1990 tax year.  The Tax
Court upheld the Commissioner's determination, finding that all the settlement
proceeds, including the $150,000 Banks had paid to his attorney, must be
included in Banks' gross income.

[*431]  The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed in part.   345 F.3d
373 (2003).  It agreed the net amount received by Banks was included in gross
income but not the amount paid to the attorney.  Relying on its prior decision
in  Estate of Clarks ex rel. Brisco-Whitter v. United States, 202 F.3d 854
(2000), the court held the contingent-fee agreement was not an anticipatory
assignment of Banks' income because the litigation recovery was not already
earned, vested, or even relatively [**830]  certain to be paid when the
contingent-fee contract was made.  A contingent-fee arrangement, the court
reasoned, is more like a partial assignment of income-producing property than an
assignment of income.  The attorney is not the mere beneficiary of the client's
largess, but rather earns his fee through skill and diligence.   345 F.3d, at
384-385 (quoting  Estate of Clarks, supra, at 857-858).  This reasoning, the
court held, applies whether or not state law grants the attorney any special
property interest (e.g., a superior lien) in part of the judgment or settlement
proceeds.

B. Commissioner v Banaitis

After leaving his job as a vice president and loan officer at the Bank of
California in 1987, Sigitas J. Banaitis retained an attorney on a contingent-fee
basis and brought suit in Oregon state court against the Bank of California and
its successor in ownership, the Mitsubishi Bank.  The complaint alleged that
Mitsubishi Bank willfully interfered with Banaitis' employment contract, and
that the Bank of California attempted to induce Banaitis to breach his fiduciary
duties to customers and discharged him when he refused.  The jury awarded
Banaitis compensatory and punitive damages.  After resolution of all appeals and
post-trial motions, the parties settled.  The defendants paid $4,864,547 to
Banaitis; and, following the formula set forth in the contingent-fee contract,
the defendants paid an additional $3,864,012 directly to Banaitis' attorney.

[*432]  Banaitis did not include the amount paid to his attorney in gross income
on his federal income tax return, and the Commissioner issued a notice of
deficiency. The Tax Court upheld the Commissioner's determination, but the Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.   340 F.3d 1074 (2003).  In contrast
to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the Banaitis court viewed state
law as  [***868]  pivotal.  Where state law confers on the attorney no special
property rights in his fee, the court said, the whole amount of the judgment or
settlement ordinarily is included in the plaintiff's gross income.  Id., at 1081
.  Oregon state law, however, like the law of some other States, grants
attorneys a superior lien in the contingent-fee portion of any recovery.  As a
result, the court held, contingent-fee agreements under Oregon law operate not
as an anticipatory assignment of the client's income but as a partial transfer
to the attorney of some of the client's property in the lawsuit.

II

To clarify why the issue here is of any consequence for tax purposes, two
preliminary observations are useful.  The first concerns the general issue of
deductibility.  For the tax years in question the legal expenses in these cases
could have been taken as miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the
ordinary requirements, 26 U.S.C. §§ 67-68 (2000 ed. and Supp. I) [26 USCS §§
67-68], but doing so would have been of no help to respondents because of the
operation of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).   [HN1] For noncorporate
individual taxpayers, the AMT establishes a tax liability floor equal to 26
percent of the taxpayer's ""alternative minimum taxable income"" (minus specified
exemptions) up to $175,000, plus 28 percent of alternative minimum taxable
income over $175,000.  §§ 55(a), (b) (2000 ed.).  Alternative minimum taxable
income, unlike ordinary gross income, does not allow any miscellaneous itemized
deductions.  § 56(b)(1)(A)(i).

[***LEdHR2] [2]  [*433]  Second, after these cases arose Congress enacted the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, 118 Stat 1418.  Section 703 of the Act
amended the Code by adding § 62(a)(19) Id., at 1546.  .  The amendment allows a
taxpayer, in computing adjusted gross income, to deduct ""attorney fees and court
costs paid by, or on behalf [**831]  of, the taxpayer in connection with any
action involving a claim of unlawful discrimination."" Ibid. The Act defines
""unlawful discrimination"" to include a number of specific federal statutes, §§
62(e)(1) to (16), any federal whistle-blower statute, § 62(e)(17), and any
federal, state, or local law ""providing for the enforcement of civil rights"" or
""regulating any aspect of the employment relationship . . . or prohibiting the
discharge of an employee, the discrimination against an employee, or any other
form of retaliation or reprisal against an employee for asserting rights or
taking other actions permitted by law,"" § 62(e)(18) Id., at 1547-1548.  These
deductions are permissible even when the AMT applies.  Had the Act been in force
for the transactions now under review, these cases likely would not have arisen.
The Act is not retroactive, however, so while it may cover future taxpayers in
respondents' position, it does not pertain here.

III

[***LEdHR3] [3]  [***LEdHR4] [4]  [HN2] The Internal Revenue Code defines ""gross
income"" for federal tax purposes as ""all income from whatever source derived.""
26 U.S.C. § 61(a) [26 USCS § 61(a)].  The definition extends broadly to all
economic gains not otherwise exempted.   Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., 348
U.S. 426, 429-430, 99 L. Ed. 483, 75 S. Ct. 473, 1955-1 C.B. 207 (1955);
Commissioner v. Jacobson, 336 U.S. 28, 49, 69 S. Ct. 358, , 93 L. Ed. 477, 1949
C.B. 40 (1949).  A taxpayer cannot  [***869]  exclude an economic gain from
gross income by assigning the gain in advance to another party.   Lucas v. Earl,
281 U.S. 111, 74 L. Ed. 731, 50 S. Ct. 241 (1930);  Comm'r v. Sunnen, 333 U.S.
591, 604, 92 L. Ed. 898, 68 S. Ct. 715 (1948);  Helvering v. Horst, 311 U.S.
112, 116-117, 85 L. Ed. 75, 61 S. Ct. 144 (1940).  The rationale for the
so-called anticipatory assignment of income doctrine is the principle that gains
should be taxed ""to those who earned them,""  Lucas, supra, at 114, 74 L. Ed. 2d
731, 50 S. Ct. 241,  [*434]  a maxim we have called ""the first principle of
income taxation,""  Comm'r v. Culbertson, 337 U.S. 733, 739-740, 93 L. Ed. 1659,
69 S. Ct. 1210, 1949-2 C.B. 5 (1949).  The anticipatory assignment doctrine is
meant to prevent taxpayers from avoiding taxation through ""arrangements and
contracts however skillfully devised to prevent [income] when paid from vesting
even for a second in the man who earned it.""  Lucas, 281 U.S., at 115, 74 L. Ed.
731, 50 S. Ct. 241.  The rule is preventative and motivated by administrative as
well as substantive concerns, so we do not inquire whether any particular
assignment has a discernible tax avoidance purpose.  As Lucas explained, ""no
distinction can be taken according to the motives leading to the arrangement by
which the fruits are attributed to a different tree from that on which they
grew."" Ibid.

[***LEdHR1A] [1B] Respondents argue that the anticipatory assignment doctrine is
a judge-made antifraud rule with no relevance to contingent-fee contracts of the
sort at issue here.  The Commissioner maintains that a contingent-fee agreement
should be viewed as an anticipatory assignment to the attorney of a portion of
the client's income from any litigation recovery.  We agree with the
Commissioner.

[***LEdHR1A] [1C]  [***LEdHR5] [5]  [HN3] In an ordinary case attribution of
income is resolved by asking whether a taxpayer exercises complete dominion over
the income in question.  Glenshaw Glass Co., supra, at 431, 99 L. Ed. 2d 483, 75
S. Ct. 473; see also  Commissioner v. Indianapolis Power & Light Co., 493 U.S.
203, 209, 107 L. Ed. 2d 591, 110 S. Ct. 589 (1990);  Commissioner v. First
Security Bank of Utah, N. A., 405 U.S. 394, 403, 31 L. Ed. 2d 318, 92 S. Ct.
1085 (1972).  In the context of anticipatory assignments, however, the assignor
often does not have dominion over the income at the moment of receipt.  In that
instance the question becomes whether the assignor [**832]  retains dominion
over the income-generating asset, because the taxpayer ""who owns or controls the
source of the income, also controls the disposition of that which he could have
received himself and diverts the payment from himself to others as the means of
procuring the satisfaction of his wants.""  Horst, supra, at 116-117, 85 L. Ed.
75, 61 S. Ct. 144.  See also  Lucas,  [*435]  supra, at 114-115, 74 L. Ed. 731,
50 S. Ct. 241;  Helvering v. Eubank, 311 U.S. 122, 124-125, 85 L. Ed. 81, 61 S.
Ct. 149, 1940-2 C.B. 209 (1940);  Sunnen, supra, at 604, 92 L. Ed. 898, 68 S.
Ct. 715.  Looking to control over the income-generating asset, then, preserves
the principle that income should be taxed to the party who earns the income and
enjoys the consequent benefits.

[***LEdHR1A] [1D]  [HN4] In the case of a litigation recovery the
income-generating asset is the cause of action that derives from the plaintiff's
legal injury.  The plaintiff retains dominion over this asset throughout the
litigation.  We do not understand respondents to argue otherwise.  Rather,
respondents  [***870]  advance two counterarguments.  First, they say that, in
contrast to the bond coupons assigned in Horst, the value of a legal claim is
speculative at the moment of assignment, and may be worth nothing at all.
Second, respondents insist that the claimant's legal injury is not the only
source of the ultimate recovery.  The attorney, according to respondents, also
contributes income-generating assets--effort and expertise--without which the
claimant likely could not prevail.  On these premises respondents urge us to
treat a contingent-fee agreement as establishing, for tax purposes, something
like a joint venture or partnership in which the client and attorney combine
their respective assets--the client's claim and the attorney's skill--and
apportion any resulting profits.

We reject respondents' arguments.   [HN5] Though the value of the plaintiff's
claim may be speculative at the moment the fee agreement is signed, the
anticipatory assignment doctrine is not limited to instances when the precise
dollar value of the assigned income is known in advance.   Lucas, supra;  United
States v. Basye, 410 U.S. 441, 445, 450-452, 35 L. Ed. 2d 412, 93 S. Ct. 1080
(1973). Though Horst involved an anticipatory assignment of a predetermined sum
to be paid on a specific date, the holding in that case did not depend on
ascertaining a liquidated amount at the time of assignment.  In each of the
cases before us, as in Horst, the taxpayer retained control over the
income-generating asset, diverted some of the income produced to another party,
and realized a benefit by doing so.  As Judge  [*436]  Wesley correctly
concluded in a recent case, the rationale of Horst applies fully to a
contingent-fee contract.   Raymond v. United States, 355 F.3d, at 115-116.  That
the amount of income the asset would produce was uncertain at the moment of
assignment is of no consequence.

[***LEdHR1A] [1E]  [***LEdHR6] [6]  [***LEdHR7] [7] We further reject the
suggestion to treat the attorney-client relationship as a sort of business
partnership or joint venture for tax purposes.   [HN6] The relationship between
client and attorney, regardless of the variations in particular compensation
agreements or the amount of skill and effort the attorney contributes, is a
quintessential principal-agent relationship.  Restatement (Second) of Agency §
1, Comment e (1957) (hereinafter Restatement); ABA Model Rules of Professional
Conduct Rule 1.3, and Comment 1; Rule 1.7, and Comment 1 (2002).  The client may
rely on the attorney's expertise and special skills to achieve a result the
client could not achieve alone.  That, however, is true of most principal-agent
relationships, and it does not alter the fact that the client retains ultimate
dominion and control over the underlying claim.  The control is evident when it
is noted that, although the [**833]  attorney can make tactical decisions
without consulting the client, the plaintiff still must determine whether to
settle or proceed to judgment and make, as well, other critical decisions.  Even
where the attorney exercises independent judgment without supervision by, or
consultation with, the client, the attorney, as an agent, is obligated to act
solely on behalf of, and for the exclusive benefit of, the client-principal,
rather than for the benefit of the attorney or any other party.  Restatement §§
13, 39, 387.

[***LEdHR1A] [1F]  [***LEdHR8] [8]  [HN7] The attorney is an agent who is duty
bound to act only in the interests of the principal, and so it is appropriate
[***871]  to treat the full amount of the recovery as income to the principal.
In this respect Judge Posner's observation is apt: ""[T]he contingent-fee lawyer
[is not] a joint owner of his client's claim in the legal sense any more than
the commission salesman is a joint owner of his employer's accounts receivable.""
[*437]   Kenseth, 259 F.3d, at 883.  In both cases a principal relies on an
agent to realize an economic gain, and the gain realized by the agent's efforts
is income to the principal.  The portion paid to the agent may be deductible,
but absent some other provision of law it is not excludable from the principal's
gross income.

[***LEdHR1A] [1G] This rule applies whether or not the attorney-client contract
or state law confers any special rights or protections on the attorney, so long
as these protections do not alter the fundamental principal-agent character of
the relationship.  Cf. Restatement § 13, Comment b, and § 14G, Comment a (an
agency relationship is created where a principal assigns a chose in action to an
assignee for collection and grants the assignee a security interest in the claim
against the assignor's debtor in order to compensate the assignee for his
collection efforts).  State laws vary with respect to the strength of an
attorney's security interest in a contingent fee and the remedies available to
an attorney should the client discharge or attempt to defraud the attorney.  No
state laws of which we are aware, however, even those that purport to give
attorneys an ""ownership"" interest in their fees, e.g.,  340 F.3d, at 1082-1083
(discussing Oregon law);  Cotnam, 263 F.2d, at 125 (discussing Alabama law),
convert the attorney from an agent to a partner.

[***LEdHR9A] [9A] Respondents and their amici propose other theories to exclude
fees from income or permit deductibility.  These suggestions include: (1) The
contingent-fee agreement establishes a Subchapter K partnership under 26 U.S.C.
§§ 702, 704, and 761 [26 USCS §§ 702, 704, and 761], Brief for Respondent in No.
03-907, pp 5-21; (2) litigation recoveries are proceeds from disposition of
property, so the attorney's fee should be subtracted as a capital expense
pursuant to §§ 1001, 1012, and 1016, Brief for Association of Trial Lawyers of
America as Amicus Curiae 23-28, Brief for Charles Davenport as Amicus Curiae
3-13; and (3) the fees are deductible reimbursed employee business expenses
under § 62(a)(2)(A) (2000 ed. and Supp I), Brief for [*438]  Stephen B. Cohen as
Amicus Curiae. These arguments, it appears, are being presented for the first
time to this Court.  We are especially reluctant to entertain novel propositions
of law with broad implications for the tax system that were not advanced in
earlier stages of the litigation and not examined by the Courts of Appeals.  We
decline comment on these supplementary theories.  In addition, we do not reach
the instance where a relator pursues a claim on behalf of the United States.
Brief for Taxpayers Against Fraud Education Fund as Amicus Curiae 10-20.

IV

[***LEdHR9A] [9B] The foregoing suffices to dispose of Banaitis' case.  Banks'
case, however, involves a further consideration.  Banks [**834]  brought his
claims under federal statutes that authorize fee awards to prevailing
plaintiffs' attorneys.  He contends that application of the anticipatory
assignment  [***872]  principle would be inconsistent with the purpose of
statutory fee-shifting provisions.  See  Venegas v. Mitchell, 495 U.S. 82, 86,
109 L. Ed. 2d 74, 110 S. Ct. 1679 (1990) (observing that statutory fees enable
""plaintiffs to employ reasonably competent lawyers without cost to themselves if
they prevail"").  In the federal system statutory fees are typically awarded by
the court under the lodestar approach,  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433,
76 L. Ed. 2d 40, 103 S. Ct. 1933 (1983), and the plaintiff usually has little
control over the amount awarded.  Sometimes, as when the plaintiff seeks only
injunctive relief, or when the statute caps plaintiffs' recoveries, or when for
other reasons damages are substantially less than attorney's fees, court-awarded
attorney's fees can exceed a plaintiff's monetary recovery.  See, e.g.,
Riverside v. Rivera, 477 U.S. 561, 564-565, 91 L. Ed. 2d 466, 106 S. Ct. 2686
(1986) (compensatory and punitive damages of $33,350; attorney's fee award of
$245,456.25).  Treating the fee award as income to the plaintiff in such cases,
it is argued, can lead to the perverse result that the plaintiff loses money by
winning the suit.  Furthermore, it is urged that treating statutory fee awards
as income to plaintiffs would  [*439]  undermine the effectiveness of
fee-shifting statutes in deputizing plaintiffs and their lawyers to act as
private attorneys general.

We need not address these claims.  After Banks settled his case, the fee paid to
his attorney was calculated solely on the basis of the private contingent-fee
contract.  There was no court-ordered fee award, nor was there any indication in
Banks' contract with his attorney, or in the settlement agreement with the
defendant, that the contingent fee paid to Banks' attorney was in lieu of
statutory fees Banks might otherwise have been entitled to recover.  Also, the
amendment added by the American Jobs Creation Act redresses the concern for
many, perhaps most, claims governed by fee-shifting statutes.


     * * *



For the reasons stated, the judgments of the Courts of Appeals for the Sixth and
Ninth Circuits are reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

The Chief Justice took no part in the decision of these cases.

 [*352]   [**1770]  Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A] At common law, the revenue rule generally barred courts from
enforcing the tax laws of foreign sovereigns. The  [*353]  question presented in
this case is whether a plot to defraud a foreign government of tax revenue
violates the federal wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (2000 ed., Supp. II) [
18 U.S.C.S. § 1343] Because the plain terms of § 1343 criminalize such a scheme,
and because this construction of the wire fraud statute does not derogate from
the common-law revenue rule, we hold that it does.

I

Petitioners Carl J. Pasquantino, David B. Pasquantino, and Arthur Hilts were
indicted for and convicted of federal wire fraud for carrying out a scheme to
smuggle large quantities of liquor into Canada from the United States.
According to the evidence presented at trial, the Pasquantinos, while in New
York, ordered liquor over the telephone from discount package stores in
Maryland.  See  336 F.3d 321, 325 (CA4 2003) (en banc).  They employed Hilts and
others to drive the liquor over the Canadian border, without paying the required
excise taxes.  Ibid. The drivers avoided paying taxes by hiding the liquor in
their vehicles and failing to declare the goods to Canadian customs officials.
Id., at 333.  During the time of petitioners' smuggling operation, between 1996
and 2000, Canada heavily taxed the importation of  [***632]  alcoholic
beverages.  See 1997 S. C., ch.  36, §§ 21.1(1), 21.2(1); Excise Act Schedule
1.(1), R. S. C., ch. E-14 (1985); Excise Act 2001, Schedule 4, ch. 22, 2002 S.
C. 239. Uncontested evidence at trial showed that Canadian taxes then due on
alcohol purchased in the United States and transported to Canada were
approximately double the liquor's purchase price.  App. 65-66.

Before trial, petitioners moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that it
stated no wire fraud offense.  The wire fraud statute prohibits the use of
interstate wires to effect ""any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining
money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or
promises."" 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (2000 ed., Supp II) [18 U.S.C.S. § 1343].
Petitioners contended that the Government lacked a  [*354]  sufficient interest
in enforcing the revenue laws of Canada, and therefore that they had not
committed wire fraud. App. 48-57.  The District Court denied the motion, and the
case went to trial.  The jury convicted petitioners of wire fraud.

Petitioners appealed their convictions to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Fourth Circuit, again urging that the indictment failed to state a wire
fraud offense.  They argued that their prosecution contravened the common-law
revenue rule, because it required the court to take cognizance of the revenue
laws of Canada.  Over Judge Hamilton's dissent, the panel agreed and reversed
the convictions.   305 F.3d 291, 295 (2002).  Petitioners [**1771]  also argued
that Canada's right to collect taxes from them was not ""money or property""
within the meaning of the wire fraud statute, but the panel unanimously rejected
that argument.   Id., at 294-295;  id., at 299 (Hamilton, J., dissenting).

The Court of Appeals granted rehearing en banc, vacated the panel's decision,
and affirmed petitioners' convictions.   336 F.3d 321 (CA4 2003).  It concluded
that the common-law revenue rule, rather than barring any recognition of foreign
revenue law, simply allowed courts to refuse to enforce the tax judgments of
foreign nations, and therefore did not preclude the Government from prosecuting
petitioners.   Id., at 327-329.  The Court of Appeals held as well that Canada's
right to receive tax revenue was ""money or property"" within the meaning of the
wire fraud statute.  Id., at 331-332.

We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict in the Courts of Appeals over
whether a scheme to defraud a foreign government of tax revenue violates the
wire fraud statute.  541 U.S. 972, 158 L. Ed. 2d 466, 124 S. Ct. 1875 (2004).
Compare  United States v. Boots, 80 F.3d 580, 587 (CA1 1996) (holding that a
scheme to defraud a foreign nation of tax revenue does not violate the wire
fraud statute), with  United States v. Trapilo, 130 F.3d 547, 552-553 (CA2 1997)
(holding that a scheme to defraud a foreign nation of tax revenue violates the
wire fraud statute).  We  [*355]  agree with the Court of Appeals that it does
and therefore affirm the judgment below. 1

1 We express no view on the related question whether a foreign government, based
on wire or mail fraud predicate offenses, may bring a civil action under the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) for a scheme to
defraud it of taxes.  See  Attorney General of Canada v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco
Holdings, Inc., 268 F.3d 103, 106 (CA2 2001) (holding that the Government of
Canada cannot bring a civil RICO suit to recover for a scheme to defraud it of

  [***633]  II

[***LEdHR1A] [1B] We first consider whether petitioners' conduct falls within
the literal terms of the wire fraud statute.  [HN1] The statute prohibits using
interstate wires to effect ""any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining
money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or
promises."" 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (2000 ed., Supp II) [18 U.S.C.S. § 1343].  Two
elements of this crime, and the only two that petitioners dispute here, are that
the defendant engage in a ""scheme or artifice to defraud,"" ibid., and that the
""object of the fraud . . . be '[money or] property' in the victim's hands,""
Cleveland v. United States, 531 U.S. 12, 26, 148 L. Ed. 2d 221, 121 S. Ct. 365
(2000). 2 Petitioners' smuggling operation satisfies both elements.

2 Although Cleveland interpreted the term ""property"" in the mail fraud statute,
18 U.S.C. § 1341 (2000 ed., Supp II) [18 U.S.C.S. § 1341], we have construed
identical language in the wire and mail fraud statutes in pari materia. See
Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 20, 144 L. Ed. 2d 35, 119 S. Ct. 1827 (1999)
(""'scheme or artifice to defraud'"");  Carpenter v. United States, 484 U.S. 19,
25, and n. 6, 98 L. Ed. 2d 275, 108 S. Ct. 316 (1987) (""scheme or artifice to
defraud""; ""money or property"").

  [***LEdHR2] [2] Taking the latter element first,  [HN2] Canada's right to
uncollected excise taxes on the liquor petitioners imported into Canada is
""property"" in its hands.  This right is an entitlement to collect money from
petitioners, the possession of which is ""something of value"" to the Government
of Canada.   McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 358, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292, 107
S. Ct. 2875 (1987) (internal  [*356]  quotation marks omitted).  Valuable
entitlements like these [**1772]  are ""property"" as that term ordinarily is
employed.  See  Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 1, 9, 160 L. Ed. 2d 271, 125 S. Ct.
377 (2004)  [HN3] (""When interpreting a statute, we must give words their
ordinary or natural meaning"" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Black's Law
Dictionary 1382 (4th ed. 1951) (defining ""property"" as ""extend[ing] to every
species of valuable right and interest"").  Had petitioners complied with this
legal obligation, they would have paid money to Canada.  Petitioners' tax
evasion deprived Canada of that money, inflicting an economic injury no less
than had they embezzled funds from the Canadian treasury.  The object of
petitioners' scheme was to deprive Canada of money legally due, and their scheme
thereby had as its object the deprivation of Canada's ""property.""

The common law of fraud confirms this characterization of Canada's right to
excise taxes.  The right to be paid money has long been thought to be a species
of property.  See 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 153-155
(1768) (classifying a right to sue on a debt as personal property); 2 J. Kent,
Commentaries on American Law *351 (same).  Consistent with that understanding,
fraud at common law included a scheme to deprive a victim of his entitlement to
money.  For instance, a debtor who concealed his assets when settling debts with
his creditors thereby committed common-law fraud.  1 J. Story, Equity
Jurisprudence § 378 (I. Redfield 10th rev. ed. 1870); Chesterfield v Janssen, 28
Eng. Rep. 82, 2 Ves. Sen. 125 (ch. 1750); 1 S. Rapalje & R. Lawrence, A
Dictionary of American  [***634]  and English Law 546 (1883).  That made sense
given the economic equivalence between money in hand and money legally due.  The
fact that the victim of the fraud happens to be the government, rather than a
private party, does not lessen the injury.

Our conclusion that the right to tax revenue is property in Canada's hands,
contrary to petitioners' contentions, is consistent with  Cleveland, supra. In
that case, the defendant,  [*357]  Cleveland, had obtained a video poker license
by making false statements on his license application.   Id., at 16-17, 148 L.
Ed. 2d 221, 121 S. Ct. 365.  We held that a State's interest in an unissued
video poker license was not ""property,"" because the interest in choosing
particular licensees was ""'purely regulatory'"" and ""[could not] be economic.""
Id., at 22-23, 148 L. Ed. 2d 221, 121 S. Ct. 365.  We also noted that ""the
Government nowhere allege[d] that Cleveland defrauded the State of any money to
which the State was entitled by law."" Ibid.

Cleveland is different from this case.  Unlike a State's interest in allocating
a video poker license to particular applicants, Canada's entitlement to tax
revenue is a straightforward ""economic"" interest.  There was no suggestion in
Cleveland that the defendant aimed at depriving the State of any money due under
the license; quite the opposite, there was ""no dispute that [the defendant's
partnership] paid the State of Louisiana its proper share of revenue"" due.   Id.
, at 22, 148 L. Ed. 2d 221, 121 S. Ct. 365.  Here, by contrast, the Government
alleged and proved that petitioners' scheme aimed at depriving Canada of money
to which it was entitled by law.  Canada could hardly have a more ""economic""
interest than in the receipt of tax revenue. Cleveland is therefore consistent
with our conclusion that Canada's entitlement is ""property"" as that word is used
in the wire fraud statute.

[***LEdHR3A] [3A] Turning to the second element at issue here, petitioners' plot
was a ""scheme or artifice to defraud"" Canada of its valuable entitlement to tax
revenue. The evidence showed that petitioners routinely concealed imported
liquor from Canadian officials and failed to declare those goods on customs
forms.  See  336 F.3d, at 333.  [**1773]  By this conduct, they represented to
Canadian customs officials that their drivers had no goods to declare.  This,
then, was a scheme ""designed to defraud by representations,""  Durland v. United
States, 161 U.S. 306, 313, 40 L. Ed. 709, 16 S. Ct. 508 (1896), and therefore a
""scheme or artifice to defraud"" Canada of taxes due on the smuggled goods.

[***LEdHR3A] [3B]  [***LEdHR4A] [4A]  [***LEdHR5] [5]  [*358]  Neither the
antismuggling statute, 18 U.S.C. § 546 [18 U.S.C.S. § 546], 3 nor U. S. tax
treaties, see  Attorney General of Canada v.  [***635]  R. J. Reynolds Tobacco
Holdings, Inc., 268 F.3d 103, 115-119 (CA2 2001), convince us that petitioners'
scheme falls outside the terms of the wire fraud statute. 4  [HN4] Unlike the
treaties and the antismuggling statute, the wire fraud statute punishes
fraudulent use of domestic wires, whether or not such conduct constitutes
smuggling, occurs aboard a vessel, or evades foreign taxes.  See  post, at 380,
n. 9, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 648 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (noting that the
antismuggling statute does not apply to this prosecution).  Petitioners would be
equally liable if they had used interstate wires to defraud Canada not of taxes
due, but of money from the Canadian treasury.  The wire fraud statute ""applies
without differentiation"" to these two categories of fraud.   Clark v. Martinez,
543 U.S. 371, 378, 543 U.S. 371, 160 L. Ed. 2d 734, 125 S. Ct. 716 (2005).  ""To
give these same words a different meaning  [*359]  for each category would be to
invent a statute rather than interpret one."" Ibid. We therefore decline to
""interpret [this] criminal statute more narrowly than it is written.""  Brogan v.
United States, 522 U.S. 398, 406, 139 L. Ed. 2d 830, 118 S. Ct. 805 (1998).

3 Section 546 provides:


     ""Any person owning in whole or in part any vessel of the United States
     who employs, or participates in, or allows the employment of, such
     vessel for the purpose of smuggling, or attempting to smuggle, or
     assisting in smuggling, any merchandise into the territory of any
     foreign government in violation of the laws there in force, if under
     the laws of such foreign government any penalty or forfeiture is
     provided for violation of the laws of the United States respecting the
     customs revenue, and any citizen of, or person domiciled in, or any
     corporation incorporated in, the United States, controlling or
     substantially participating in the control of any such vessel,
     directly or indirectly, whether through ownership of corporate shares
     or otherwise, and allowing the employment of said vessel for any such
     purpose, and any person found, or discovered to have been, on board of
     any such vessel so employed and participating or assisting in any such
     purpose, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than
     two years, or both.""




4  [***LEdHR4A] [4B] Any overlap between the antismuggling statute and the wire
fraud statute is beside the point.  The Federal Criminal Code is replete with
provisions that criminalize overlapping conduct.  See Stuntz, The Pathological
Politics of Criminal Law,  100 Mich. L. Rev. 505, 518, and n. 62 (2002);  United
States v. Wells, 519 U.S. 482, 505-509, and nn. 8-10, 137 L. Ed. 2d 107, 117 S.
Ct. 921 (1997) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  The mere fact that two federal
criminal statutes criminalize similar conduct says little about the scope of
either.

III

[***LEdHR6A] [6A] We next consider petitioners' revenue rule argument.
Petitioners argue that, to avoid reading § 1343 to derogate from the common-law
revenue rule, we should construe the otherwise-applicable language of the wire
fraud statute to except frauds directed at evading foreign taxes.  Their
argument relies on  [HN5] the canon of construction that ""[s]tatutes which
invade the common law . . . are to be read with a presumption favoring the
retention of long-established and familiar principles, except when a statutory
purpose to the contrary is evident.""  United States v. Texas, 507 U.S. 529, 534,
123 L. Ed. 2d 245, 113 S. Ct. 1631 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted).
This presumption is, however, no bar to a construction that conflicts with a
common-law rule if  [**1774] the statute ""'speak[s] directly' to the question
addressed by the common law."" Ibid.

[***LEdHR6A] [6B]  [***LEdHR7] [7] Whether the wire fraud statute derogates from
the common-law revenue rule depends, in turn, on whether reading § 1343 to reach
this prosecution conflicts with a well-established revenue rule principle.  We
clarified this constraint on the application of the nonderogation canon in
United States v. Craft, 535 U.S. 274, 152 L. Ed. 2d 437, 122 S. Ct. 1414 (2002).
The issue in Craft was whether the property interest of a tenant by the entirety
was exempt from a federal tax lien.   Id., at 276, 152 L. Ed. 2d 437, 122 S. Ct.
1414.  We construed the federal tax lien statute to reach such a property
interest, despite the tension between that construction and the common-law rule
that entireties property enjoys immunity from liens, because this ""common-law
rule was not so well  [***636]  established with respect to the application of a
federal tax lien that we must assume that Congress considered the impact of its
enactment on the question now before us.""  [*360]   Id., at 288, 152 L. Ed. 2d
437, 122 S. Ct. 1414 5  So too here, before we may conclude that Congress
intended to exempt the present prosecution from the broad reach of the wire
fraud statute, we must find that the common-law revenue rule clearly barred such
a prosecution.  We examine the state of the common law as of 1952, the year
Congress enacted the wire fraud statute. See  Neder v. United States, 527 U.S.
1, 22-23, 144 L. Ed. 2d 35, 119 S. Ct. 1827 (1999). 6

according to the common law because the term had ""no accepted common-law
meaning"").

6 These principles convince us that much more than the summary conclusion that
it is ""unavoidably obvious . . . that this prosecution directly implicates the
revenue rule"" and that this prosecution is ""'primarily about enforcing Canadian
law,'""  post, at 377, 382, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 646, 649 (Ginsburg, J.,
dissenting), is required to demonstrate that a revenue rule principle firmly
established as of 1952 bars this prosecution.  That task requires inquiry into
common-law revenue rule jurisprudence--an inquiry the dissent does not
undertake.

  [HN6]  [***LEdHR1A] [1C]  [***LEdHR8A] [8A] The wire fraud statute derogates
from no well-established revenue rule principle.  We are aware of no common-law
revenue rule case decided as of 1952 that held or clearly implied that the
revenue rule barred the United States from prosecuting a fraudulent scheme to
evade foreign taxes.  The traditional rationales for the revenue rule, moreover,
do not plainly suggest that it swept so broadly.  We consider these two points
in turn.

A

We first consider common-law revenue rule jurisprudence as it existed in 1952,
the year Congress enacted § 1343.  Since the late 19th and early 20th century,
courts have treated the common-law revenue rule as a corollary of the  [*361]
rule that, as Chief Justice Marshall put it, ""[t]he Courts of no country execute
the penal laws of another.""  The Antelope, 23 U.S. 66, 123, 10 Wheat. 66, 6 L.
Ed. 268 (1825).  The rule against the enforcement of foreign penal statutes, in
turn, tracked the common-law principle that crimes could only be prosecuted in
the country in which they were committed.  See, e.g., J. Story, Commentaries on
the Conflict of Laws § 620, p 840 (M. Bigelow [**1775]  ed. 8th ed. 1883).  The
basis for inferring the revenue rule from the rule against foreign penal
enforcement was an analogy between foreign revenue laws and penal laws.  See
Wisconsin v. Pelican Ins. Co., 127 U.S. 265, 290, 32 L. Ed. 239, 8 S. Ct. 1370
(1888); Leflar, Extrastate Enforcement of Penal and Governmental Claims,  46
Harv. L. Rev. 193, 219 (1932) (hereinafter Leflar).

Courts first drew that inference in a line of cases prohibiting the enforcement
of tax liabilities of one sovereign in the courts of another sovereign, such as
a suit to enforce a tax judgment. 7 The revenue rule's  [***637]  grounding in
these cases shows that,  [HN7] at its core, it prohibited the collection of tax
obligations of foreign nations.  Unsurprisingly, then, the revenue rule is often
stated as prohibiting the collection of foreign tax claims.  See Brief for
Petitioners 16 (noting that ""[t]he most straightforward application of the
revenue rule arises when a foreign sovereign attempts to sue directly in its own
right to enforce a tax judgment in the courts of another nation""). 8

483 (1986) (stating that the rule does not require, but allows, courts to refuse
enforcement of foreign tax judgments).

  [***LEdHR8A] [8B]  [***LEdHR9A] [9A]  [*362]  The present prosecution is
unlike these classic examples of actions traditionally barred by the revenue
rule.  It is not a suit that recovers a foreign tax liability, like a suit to
enforce a judgment.  This is a criminal prosecution brought by the United States
in its sovereign capacity to punish domestic criminal conduct.  Petitioners
nevertheless argue that common-law revenue rule jurisprudence as of 1952
prohibited such prosecutions.  Revenue rule cases, however, do not establish
that proposition, much less clearly so.

1

Petitioners first analogize the present action to several cases that have
applied the revenue rule to bar indirect enforcement of foreign revenue laws, in
contrast to the direct collection of a tax obligation.  They cite, for example,
a decision of an Irish trial court holding that a private liquidator could not
recover assets unlawfully distributed and moved to Ireland by a corporate
director, because the recovery would go to satisfy the company's Scottish tax
obligations.  Peter Buchanan Ltd. v McVey, 1955 A. C. 516, 529-530 (Ir. H. Ct.
1950), app. dism'd, 1955 A. C. 530 (Ir. Sup. Ct. 1951). 9  [*363]  The court
found that ""the [**1776]  sole object of the  [***638]  liquidation proceedings
in Scotland was to collect a revenue debt,"" because if the liquidator won,
""every penny recovered after paying certain costs . . . could be claimed by the
Scottish Revenue."" Id., at 530.  According to the Buchanan court, ""[i]n every
case the substance of the claim must be scrutinized, and if it then appears that
it is really a suit brought for the purpose of collecting the debts of a foreign
revenue it must be rejected."" Id., at 529.

  [***LEdHR9A] [9B] Buchanan and the other cases on which petitioners rely
cannot bear the weight petitioners place on them.  Many of them were decided
after 1952, too late for the Congress that passed the wire fraud statute to have
relied on them.  Others come from foreign courts.  Drawing sure inferences
regarding Congress' intent from such foreign citations is perilous, as several
of petitioners' cases illustrate. 10

10 For example, in Government of India v Taylor, 1955 A. C. 491 (H. L.), on
which petitioners rely heavily, the court's application of the revenue rule
rested in part on a ground peculiar to English law, namely, that an Act of
Parliament had excluded tax judgments from a statute that provided for the
enforcement of foreign judgments.  That Act thus demonstrated that the revenue
rule ""appear[ed] to have been recognized by Parliament."" Id., at 506; see also
Borax, supra, at 549 (holding that a private debtor was not entitled to deduct
U. S. income tax from its interest payments on a loan, in part because ""there
[was] an express Act of Parliament which permits payment to the English Income
Tax authorities to be a discharge pro tanto of the debt which a person owes in
respect of yearly interest to another"" while ""[t]here [was] no Act of Parliament
which allows payment of income tax to another country to be reckoned as
discharge""); Schulze, supra, at 5 (holding that a foreign state could not
recover court costs incurred in defending the legality of a tax forfeiture, in
part because ""in our [i. e., Scottish] law, the expenses of an action have
always been regarded as a mere accessory or incident of the principal claim"").
In addition, as we explain below, features peculiar to the American system of
separation of powers cast doubt on the notion that the revenue rule bars this
prosecution.  See  infra, at 369-370, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 641-642.

  [***LEdHR9A] [9C]  [***LEdHR10] [10]  [*364]  More important, none of these
cases clearly establishes that the revenue rule barred this prosecution.  None
involved a domestic sovereign acting pursuant to authority conferred by a
criminal statute.  The difference is significant.  An action by a domestic
sovereign enforces the sovereign's own penal law.  A prohibition on the
enforcement of foreign penal law does not plainly prevent the Government from
enforcing a domestic criminal law.  Such an extension, to our knowledge, is
unprecedented in the long history of either the revenue rule or the rule against
enforcement of penal laws.

[***LEdHR9A] [9D] Moreover, none of petitioners' cases (with the arguable
exception of  Banco Do Brasil, S. A. v. A. C. Israel Commodity Co., 12 N.Y.2d
371, 190  [**1777] N.E.2d 235, 239 N.Y.S.2d 872 (App. 1963)) barred an action
that had as its primary object the deterrence and punishment of fraudulent
conduct--a substantial domestic regulatory interest entirely independent of
foreign tax enforcement.  The main object of the action in each of those cases
was the collection of money that would pay foreign tax claims.  The absence of
such an object in this action means that the link between this prosecution and
foreign tax collection is incidental and attenuated at best, making it not
plainly one in which ""the whole object of the suit is to collect tax for
[***639]  a foreign revenue."" Buchanan, supra, at 529.  Even those courts that
as of 1952 had extended the revenue rule beyond its core prohibition had not
faced a case closely  [*365]  analogous to this one--and thus we cannot say with
any reasonable certainty whether Congress in 1952 would have considered this
prosecution within the revenue rule.

object of this suit, because restitution of the lost tax revenue to Canada is

JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting from the denial of
certiorari.

In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that respondent
Derrick Quintero was entitled to federal habeas  [*937]  relief from his
state-court conviction for escaping from prison. Because the Court of Appeals
failed to follow this Court's decision in  Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 152 L.
Ed. 2d 914, 122 S. Ct. 1843 (2002), I would grant the warden's petition for
certiorari and reverse.

Respondent was convicted in Kentucky state court of escaping from prison with
two other inmates. The jury to which the Commonwealth tried him included seven
members who had served on a jury that had convicted one of the other escapees,
Billy Hall. Respondent's trial counsel represented Hall at Hall's trial, which
was held on October 16, 1989. Final Brief for Petitioner/Appellee in No. 99-6724
(CA6), p. 7.

Respondent was tried almost two months later, on December 11, together with the
other escapee, James Blanton. Respondent and Blanton both admitted their factual
guilt; their only defense was that the escape was a necessary ""choice of evils,""
because they were in imminent danger of physical harm while in prison. Pet. for
Cert. 5. The trial judge rejected that defense as a matter of law and declined
to submit it to the jury. Respondent did not object to the composition of the
jury on the ground  [***507]  that it contained jurors who had participated in
Hall's trial and therefore, as a matter of state law, forfeited any claim of
error based on that ground.

Respondent sought federal habeas relief, claiming that the trial had infringed
his constitutional right to an impartial jury. Respondent argued that his
counsel's failure to object to the composition of the jury was ineffective
assistance of counsel, thereby excusing his forfeiture of the jury-bias claim.
The Court of Appeals agreed and excused the procedural default, holding that
counsel's failure to object constituted per se ineffective assistance of counsel
under  United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 80 L. Ed. 2d 657, 104 S. Ct. 2039
(1984).  Quintero v. Bell, 256 F.3d 409, 413-415 (CA6 2001). Cronic established
that certain failings of counsel justify a per se presumption of
ineffectiveness, see  466 U.S., at 658-659, notwithstanding the general rule
that to demonstrate ineffectiveness, a defendant must show that his counsel's
performance was both deficient and prejudicial, see  Strickland v. Washington,
466 U.S. 668, 687, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984).

The Court of Appeals did not claim that counsel's failure to object to the
composition of the jury fell into one of the three categories of error that
Cronic recognized. See  Cone, supra, at 695-696 (discussing Cronic's three
categories). Instead, it reasoned  [*938]  that Cronic applied because the
biased jury was a ""structural error"" exempt from harmless-error analysis,
depriving the trial of ""'its character as a confrontation between adversaries.'""
Quintero, supra, at 415 (quoting  Cronic, supra, at 657). Reaching the merits,
the Court of Appeals held that the state-court trial had violated respondent's
constitutional right to an impartial jury, and affirmed the District Court's
decision to grant respondent a conditional  [**2241]  writ of habeas corpus.
Quintero, supra, at 412-413, 416.

We granted the warden's petition for certiorari, vacated the Court of Appeals'
judgment, and remanded the case in light of  Bell v. Cone, supra.  Bell v.
Quintero, 535 U.S. 1109, 153 L. Ed. 2d 152, 122 S. Ct. 2324 (2002). In Cone, we
reversed a Sixth Circuit decision that had misapplied Cronic. Cone involved a
habeas petitioner who had been convicted of capital murder and sentenced to
death. At the penalty phase of petitioner's trial, petitioner's lawyer called
the jury's attention to mitigating evidence that had been presented to it during
the guilt phase of the trial, showing petitioner's disturbed mental state and
drug addiction.  535 U.S., at 691. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals concluded
that counsel had failed to subject the case to ""'meaningful adversarial
testing'"" at the penalty phase -- one of the three recognized examples of Cronic
error, see  535 U.S., at 695-696 -- because counsel had failed to present
additional mitigating evidence, and because counsel had waived final argument.
Cone v. Bell, 243 F.3d 961, 979 (2001) (quoting  Cronic, supra, at 656). We
reversed, reasoning:




     ""When we spoke in Cronic of the possibility of presuming prejudice
     based on an attorney's failure to test the prosecutor's case, we
     indicated that the attorney's failure must be complete. We said 'if
     counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution's case to meaningful
     adversarial testing.'  Cronic, supra, at 659 (emphasis added). Here,
     respondent's argument is not that his counsel failed to oppose the
     prosecution throughout the sentencing proceeding as a whole, but that
     his counsel failed to do so at specific points. For purposes of
     distinguishing between the rule of Strickland and that of Cronic, this
     difference is not of degree but of kind.""  535 U.S., at 696-697.



 [***508]  After we vacated and remanded its judgment in light of Cone, the
Court of Appeals in the decision below again held that respondent's  [*939]
attorney had committed Cronic error. It reasoned that ""counsel's acquiescence in
allowing seven jurors who had convicted [respondent's] co-conspirators to sit in
judgment of his case surely amounted to an abandonment of 'meaningful
adversarial testing' throughout the proceeding,"" and therefore was per se
ineffective assistance of counsel under Cronic.  368 F.3d 892, 893 (CA6 2004)
(quoting  Cronic, supra, at 659; emphasis in original). For this reason, the
Court of Appeals found the present case distinguishable from Cone, once again
excused respondent's procedural default, and reinstated its previous opinion and
judgment.  368 F.3d at 893 .

The Court of Appeals committed the same error we corrected in Cone. It held that
respondent's counsel failed to subject his case to meaningful adversarial
testing. Yet our decision in Cone makes clear that for a court to ""presume
prejudice based on an attorney's failure to test the prosecutor's case, . . .
the attorney's failure must be complete.  ""  535 U.S., at 697; accord,  Florida
v. Nixon, 543 U.S. 175, 190, 160 L. Ed. 2d 565, 573, 125 S. Ct. 551, 555 (2004)
);  French v. Jones, 332 F.3d 430, 439 (CA6 2003). Here, counsel's failure was
far from complete. Respondent's attorney extensively questioned the veniremen
for prior knowledge and bias, put on a necessity defense, cross-examined the
Commonwealth's witnesses, made numerous motions and objections, and delivered a
closing statement. * As in  [*940]   [**2242]  Cone, ""respondent's argument is
not that his counsel failed to oppose the prosecution throughout the [case] as a
whole, but that his counsel failed to do so at specific points"" -- namely, at
the specific point of jury selection.  535 U.S., at 697. The notion that this
discrete error amounts to a complete failure of meaningful adversarial testing
is flatly inconsistent with Cone's analysis, though it does resemble the
reasoning of the lone Cone dissenter. See  id., at 716-717 (opinion of STEVENS,
J.) (concluding that when an error ""concerns 'points' that encompass all of
counsel's fundamental duties at a capital sentencing proceeding . . . counsel
has failed 'entirely'"" (emphasis in original)).

 The Court of Appeals' holding also rests on a confusion -- the idea that the
presence of a structural error, by itself, is necessarily related to counsel's
deficient performance and warrants a presumption of prejudice. The Cronic
presumption is based on the notion that certain ""circumstances . . . are so
likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a
particular case is unjustified.""  466 U.S., at 658, 80 L. Ed.  [***509]  2d 657,
104 S. Ct. 2039. Those exceptional circumstances encompass instances in which
counsel's poor performance caused the defendant prejudice, not any prejudicial
circumstance whatsoever. See  Cone, supra, at 695-696 (enumerating examples of
Cronic error, all involving circumstances related to whether counsel's
assistance was ineffective). Yet there is no close correlation between counsel's
performance and whether a trial was infected with structural error, much less
one so close as to justify a presumption that counsel was ineffective. For
example, even competent counsel may fail to object to a biased trial judge or to
the exclusion of grand jurors on the basis of the defendant's race. The
structural nature of these defects, see  Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.S. 510, 535, 71 L.
Ed. 749, 47 S. Ct. 437, 5 Ohio Law Abs. 159, 5 Ohio Law Abs. 185, 25 Ohio L.
Rep. 236 (1927);   Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.S. 254, 262, 88 L. Ed. 2d 598, 106
S. Ct. 617 (1986), says only that a serious error infected the trial, not that
the error resulted from counsel's ineffective assistance.

The Court of Appeals' reasoning equally would apply even if counsel's failure to
object to the biased jurors were blameless and the quality of his assistance
high. See  Quintero, 256 F.3d at 415. Even a competent defense lawyer may not
have known that the jurors had served previously, for  [**2243]  example, if the
veniremen  [*941]  were not forthcoming at voir dire. It is no answer to say
that it is obvious that counsel in this case should have objected to the
composition of the jury; the whole point of the Cronic presumption is to presume
ineffectiveness without inquiring on a case-by-case, error-by-error basis into
the wisdom of counsel's actual performance (and any resulting prejudice) under
Strickland. The fact that respondent had a potentially biased jury may well be a
serious trial error. But it is not an error that warrants the per se conclusion
that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective.

It is also far from clear on the present record that counsel's failure to object
to the biased nature of the jury was blameworthy. The Court of Appeals based its
holding that counsel was ineffective on the implicit supposition that he knew
that the seven jurors had previously served, yet failed to object to their
presence.  Quintero, supra, at 415. That assumption is not clearly correct.
Almost two months elapsed between the trial of respondent's coescapee, Billy
Hall, and respondent's trial. Respondent's counsel was a public defender, and in
the shuffle of a heavy caseload may well have forgotten the names and faces of
the seven jurors who had served previously. Moreover, counsel extensively
questioned the veniremen about possible bias, asked that veniremen be
disqualified because they had prior knowledge of the case, and moved for a
mistrial on the ground that the entire jury was tainted by pretrial publicity.
See supra, at 939-940, n. Counsel's concern with these sources of jury bias is
hard to square with the hypothesis that he knew that seven members of
respondent's jury had served on Hall's jury, yet ignored such an obvious source
of jury bias. In any event, counsel's performance may well have been deficient,
but this lingering factual uncertainty illustrates the danger of presuming --
over a decade after the fact and based on nothing more than a federal appellate
court's reading of the cold record -- that counsel's failure to object was per
se constitutionally ineffective.

The Court of Appeals' decision is one of three Sixth Circuit judgments that we
vacated and remanded in light of Cone. See  Quintero, 535 U.S. 1109, 153 L. Ed.
2d 152, 122 S. Ct. 2324;  Mason v. Mitchell, 536 U.S. 901, 153 L. Ed. 2d 177,
122 S. Ct. 2354 (2002);  Jones v. French, 535 U.S. 1109, 153 L. Ed. 2d 153, 122
S. Ct. 2324 (2002). In all three, the Sixth Circuit reinstated its previous
opinion and again ordered the writs granted. See  368 F.3d at 893 (case below);
Mitchell v. Mason, [*942]  325 F.3d 732, 742-744 (2003) (again finding Cronic
error);  French v. Jones, 332 F.3d at 436-439 (same). In Cone itself,  [***510]
the Sixth Circuit reinstated its order affirming the grant of the writ, albeit
on grounds independent of Cronic. See  Cone v. Bell, 359 F.3d 785, 799 (2004).
These decisions were all dubious applications of this Court's precedents. See
Bell v. Cone, 543 U.S. 447, 459-460, 160 L. Ed. 2d 881, 125 S. Ct. 847 (2005)
(per curiam) (summarily reversing);  Mitchell, 325 F.3d at 748-749 (Carr, J.,
dissenting); Pet. for Cert. in Jones v. French, O. T. 2003, No. 03-522. The
Court's decision to deny the warden's petition in the present case, of course,
says nothing about whether the Court of Appeals' reasoning was correct. See,
e.g.,  Foster v. Florida, 537 U.S. 990, 154 L. Ed. 2d 359, 123 S. Ct. 470 (2002)
(opinion of STEVENS, J., respecting denial of certiorari). But in view of this
series of questionable applications of our precedent, especially of our first
Cone opinion, I would correct the Court of Appeals' latest error. I therefore
respectfully dissent.

In 1994 petitioner, Gary Small, was convicted in a Japanese court of having
tried to smuggle several pistols, a rifle, and ammunition into Japan.  Small was
sentenced to five years' imprisonment.  183 F. Supp. 2d 755, 757, n. 3 (WD Pa.
2002).  After his release, Small returned to the United States, where he bought
a gun from a Pennsylvania gun dealer.  Federal authorities subsequently charged
Small under the ""unlawful gun possession"" statute here at issue.   333 F.3d 425,
426 (CA3 2003).  Small pleaded guilty while reserving the right to challenge his
conviction on the ground that his earlier conviction, being a foreign
conviction, fell outside the scope of the illegal gun possession statute.  The
Federal District Court rejected Small's argument, as did the Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit. 183 F. Supp. 2d, at 759;  333 F.3d at 427, n. 2.  Because
the Circuits disagree about the matter, we granted certiorari.  Compare  United
States v. Atkins, 872 F.2d 94, 96 (CA4 1989) (""convicted in any court"" includes
foreign convictions);  United States v. Winson, 793 F.2d 754, 757-759 (CA6 1986)
(same), with  United States v. Gayle, 342 F.3d 89, 95 (CA2 2003) (""convicted in
any court"" does not include foreign convictions);   United States v. Concha, 233
F.3d 1249, 1256 (CA10 2000) (same).

[***656]  [*388]   II

A

[***LEdHR2] [2] The question before us is whether the statutory reference
""convicted in any court"" includes a conviction entered in a foreign court.  The
word ""any"" considered alone cannot answer this question.  In ordinary life, a
speaker who says, ""I'll see any film,"" may or may not mean to include films
shown in another city.  In law, a legislature that uses the statutory phrase
""'any person'"" may or may not mean to include ""'persons'"" outside ""the
jurisdiction of the state."" See, e.g.,  United States v. Palmer, 16 U.S. 610, 3
Wheat. 610, 631, 4 L. Ed. 471 (1818) (Marshall, C. J.) (""[G]eneral words,"" such
as the word ""'any,'"" must ""be limited"" in their application ""to those objects to
which the legislature intended to apply [**1755]  them"");  Nixon v. Missouri
Municipal League, 541 U.S. 125, 132, 158 L. Ed. 2d 291, 124 S. Ct. 1555 (2004)
(""'any'"" means ""different things depending upon the setting"");  United States v.
Alvarez-Sanchez, 511 U.S. 350, 357, 128 L. Ed. 2d 319, 114 S. Ct. 1599 (1994)
(""[R]espondent errs in placing dispositive weight on the broad statutory
reference to 'any' law enforcement officer or agency without considering the
rest of the statute"");  Middlesex County Sewerage Auth. v. National Sea Clammers
Ass'n, 453 U.S. 1, 15-16, 69 L. Ed. 2d 435, 101 S. Ct. 2615 (1981) (it is
doubtful that the phrase ""'any statute'"" includes the very statute in which the
words appear);  Flora v. United States, 362 U.S. 145, 149, 4 L. Ed. 2d 623, 80
S. Ct. 630, 1960-1 C.B. 660 (1960) ('""[A]ny sum,'"" while a ""catchall"" phase,
does not ""define what it catches"").  Thus, even though the word ""any"" demands a
broad interpretation, see, e.g.,  United States v. Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5, 137
L. Ed. 2d 132, 117 S. Ct. 1032 (1997), we must look beyond that word itself.

[***LEdHR1A] [1B]  [***LEdHR3A] [3A] In determining the scope of the statutory
phrase we find help in the ""commonsense notion that Congress generally
legislates with domestic concerns in mind.""  Smith v. United States, 507 U.S.
197, 204, n. 5, 122 L. Ed. 2d 548, 113 S. Ct. 1178 (1993).  This notion has led
[HN2] the Court to adopt the legal presumption that Congress ordinarily intends
its statutes to have domestic, not extraterritorial,  [*389]  application.  See
Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U.S. 281, 285, 93 L. Ed. 680, 69 S. Ct. 575
(1949); see also  Palmer, supra, at 631, 3 Wheat. 610, 631, 4 L. Ed. 471 (""The
words 'any person or persons,' are broad enough to comprehend every human being""
but are ""limited to cases within the jurisdiction of the state"");  EEOC v.
Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 249-251, 113 L. Ed. 2d 274, 111 S. Ct.
1227 (1991).  That presumption would apply, for example, were we to consider
whether this statute prohibits unlawful gun possession abroad as well as
domestically. And, although the presumption against extraterritorial application
does not apply directly to this case, we believe a similar assumption is
appropriate when we consider the scope of the phrase ""convicted in any court""
here.

[***LEdHR1A] [1C] For one thing, the phrase describes one necessary portion of
the ""gun possession"" activity that is prohibited as a matter of domestic law.
For another, considered as a group, foreign convictions differ from domestic
convictions in important ways.  Past foreign convictions for crimes punishable
by more than one year's imprisonment may include a conviction for conduct that
domestic laws would permit, for example, for engaging in economic conduct that
[***657]  our society might encourage.  See, e.g., Art. 153 of the Criminal Code
of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, in Soviet Criminal Law and
Procedure 171 (H. Berman & J. Spindler transls. 2d ed. 1972) (criminalizing
""Private Entrepreneurial Activity""); Art. 153, id., at 172 (criminalizing
""Speculation,"" which is defined as ""the buying up and reselling of goods or any
other articles for the purpose of making a profit""); cf., e.g., Gaceta Oficial
de la Republica de Cuba, ch. II, Art. 103, p 68 (Dec. 30, 1987) (forbidding
propaganda that incites against the social order, international solidarity, or
the Communist state).  They would include a conviction from a legal system that
is inconsistent with an American understanding of fairness.  See, e.g., U. S.
Dept. of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2003, Submitted to
the House Committee on International Relations and the Senate Committee on
Foreign Relations, 108th Cong., 2d Sess., 702-705,  [*390]  1853, 2023 (Joint
Comm. Print 2004) (describing failures of ""due process"" and citing examples in
which ""the testimony of one man equals that of two women"").  [**1756]  And they
would include a conviction for conduct that domestic law punishes far less
severely.  See, e.g., Singapore Vandalism Act, ch 108, §§ 2, 3, III Statutes of
Republic of Singapore, pp. 257-258 (imprisonment for up to three years for an
act of vandalism).  Thus, the key statutory phrase ""convicted in any court of, a
crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year"" somewhat less
reliably identifies dangerous individuals for the purposes of U. S. law where
foreign convictions, rather than domestic convictions, are at issue.

In addition, it is difficult to read the statute as asking judges or prosecutors
to refine its definitional distinctions where foreign convictions are at issue.
To somehow weed out inappropriate foreign convictions that meet the statutory
definition is not consistent with the statute's language; it is not easy for
those not versed in foreign laws to accomplish; and it would leave those
previously convicted in a foreign court (say of economic crimes) uncertain about
their legal obligations.  Cf. 1 United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines
Manual § 4A1.2(h) (Nov. 2004) (""[S]entences resulting from foreign convictions
are not counted"" as a ""prior sentence"" for criminal history purposes).

[***LEdHR1A] [1D]  [***LEdHR3A] [3B] These considerations, suggesting
significant differences between foreign and domestic convictions, do not dictate
our ultimate conclusion.  Nor do they create a ""clear statement"" rule, imposing
upon Congress a special burden of specificity.  See post, at 399, 161 L. Ed. 2d,
at 663 (Thomas,  J., dissenting).  They simply convince us that we should apply
an ordinary assumption about the reach of domestically oriented statutes
here--an assumption that helps us determine Congress' intent where Congress
likely did not consider the matter and where other indicia of intent are in
approximate balance.  Cf. ibid. We consequently assume a congressional intent
that the phrase  [*391]  ""convicted in any court"" applies domestically, not
extraterritorially. But, at the same time, we stand ready to revise this
assumption should statutory language, context, history, or purpose show the
contrary.

B

[***LEdHR1A] [1E] We have found no convincing  [***658]  indication to the
contrary here.  The statute's language does not suggest any intent to reach
beyond domestic convictions.  Neither does it mention foreign convictions nor is
its subject matter special, say, immigration or terrorism, where one could argue
that foreign convictions would seem especially relevant.  To the contrary, if
read to include foreign convictions, the statute's language creates anomalies.

For example, the statute creates an exception that allows gun possession despite
a prior conviction for an antitrust or business regulatory crime.  18 U.S.C. §
921(a)(20)(A) [18 USCS § 921 (a)(20)(A).  In doing so, the exception speaks of
""Federal or State"" antitrust or regulatory offenses.  Ibid. If the phrase
""convicted in any court"" generally refers only to domestic convictions, this
language causes no problem.  But if ""convicted in any court"" includes foreign
convictions, the words ""Federal or State"" prevent the exception from applying
where a foreign antitrust or regulatory conviction is at issue.  An individual
convicted of, say, a Canadian antitrust offense could not lawfully possess a
gun, Combines Investigation Act, 2 R. S. C. 1985, ch. C-34, §§ 61(6), (9), but a
similar individual convicted of, say, a New York antitrust offense, could
lawfully possess a gun.

For example, the statute specifies that predicate crimes include ""a misdemeanor
crime of domestic violence."" 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9) [18 USCS § 922(g)(9)].
Again, the language specifies that these predicate crimes include only crimes
that are ""misdemeanor[s] under [**1757]  Federal or State law."" § 921(a)(33)(A).
If ""convicted in any court"" refers only to domestic convictions, this language
creates no problem.  If the phrase also refers to  [*392]  foreign convictions,
the language creates an apparently senseless distinction between (covered)
domestic relations misdemeanors committed within the United States and
(uncovered) domestic relations misdemeanors committed abroad.

For example, the statute provides an enhanced penalty where unlawful gun
possession rests upon three predicate convictions for a ""serious drug offense.""
§ 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp II).  Again the statute defines the relevant drug
crimes through reference to specific federal crimes and with the words ""offense
under State law."" §§ 924(e)(2)(A)(i), (ii) (2000 ed.).  If ""convicted in any
court"" refers only to domestic convictions, this language creates no problem.
But if the phrase also refers to foreign convictions, the language creates an
apparently senseless distinction between drug offenses committed within the
United States (potentially producing enhanced punishments) and similar offenses
committed abroad (not producing enhanced punishments).

For example, the statute provides that offenses that are punishable by a term of
imprisonment of up to two years, and characterized under state law as
misdemeanors, are not predicate crimes.  § 921(a)(20).  This exception is
presumably based on the determination that such state crimes are not
sufficiently serious or dangerous so as to preclude an individual from
possessing a firearm. If ""convicted in any court"" refers only to domestic
convictions, this language creates no problem.  But if the phrase also refers to
foreign convictions, the language creates another apparently senseless
distinction between less serious crimes (misdemeanors punishable by  [***659]
more than one year's imprisonment) committed within the United States (not
predicate crimes) and similar offenses committed abroad (predicate crimes).
These illustrative examples taken together suggest that Congress did not
consider whether the generic phrase ""convicted in any court"" applies to domestic
as well as foreign convictions.

[*393]  The statute's lengthy legislative history confirms the fact that
Congress did not consider whether foreign convictions should or should not serve
as a predicate to liability under the provision here at issue.  Congress did
consider a Senate bill containing language that would have restricted predicate
offenses to domestic offenses.  See S. Rep. No. 1501, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 31
(1968) (defining predicate crimes in terms of ""Federal"" crimes ""punishable by a
term of imprisonment exceeding one year"" and crimes ""determined by the laws of
the State to be a felony"").  And the Conference Committee ultimately rejected
this version in favor of language that speaks of those ""convicted in any court
of, a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year."" H. R.
Conf. Rep. No. 1956, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 28-29 (1968).  But the history does
not suggest that this language change reflected a congressional view on the
matter before us.  Rather, the enacted version is simpler and it avoids
potential difficulties arising out of the fact that States may define the term
""felony"" differently.  And as far as the legislative history is concerned, these
latter virtues of the new language fully explain the change.  Thus, those who
use legislative history to help discern congressional intent will see the
history here as silent, hence a neutral factor, that simply confirms the
obvious, namely, that Congress did not consider the issue.  Others will not be
tempted to use or to discuss the [**1758]  history at all.  But cf. post, at
406, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 667 (Thomas, J., dissenting).

The statute's purpose does offer some support for a reading of the phrase that
includes foreign convictions.  As the Government points out, Congress sought to
""'keep guns out of the hands of those who have demonstrated that they may not be
trusted to possess a firearm without becoming a threat to society.'"" Brief for
United States 16 (quoting  Dickerson v. New Banner Institute, Inc., 460 U.S.
103, 112, 74 L. Ed. 2d 845, 103 S. Ct. 986 (1983)); see also  Lewis v. United
States, 445 U.S. 55, 60-62, 66, 63 L. Ed. 2d 198, 100 S. Ct. 915 (1980);
Huddleston v. United States, 415 U.S. 814, 824, 39 L. Ed. 2d 782, 94 S. Ct. 1262
[*394]  (1974).  And, as the dissent properly notes, post, at 402-403, 161 L.
Ed. 2d, at 667, one convicted of a serious crime abroad may well be as dangerous
as one convicted of a similar crime in the United States.

The force of this argument is weakened significantly, however, by the empirical
fact that, according to the Government, since 1968, there have probably been no
more than ""10 to a dozen"" instances in which such a foreign conviction has
served as a predicate for a felon-in-possession prosecution.  Tr. of Oral Arg.
32.  This empirical fact reinforces the likelihood that Congress, at best, paid
no attention to the matter.

C

In sum, we have no reason to believe that Congress considered the added
enforcement advantages flowing from inclusion of foreign crimes,  weighing them
against, say, the potential  [***660]  unfairness of preventing those with inapt
foreign convictions from possessing guns. See supra, at 389, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at
657.  The statute itself and its history offer only congressional silence.
Given the reasons for disfavoring an inference of extraterritorial coverage from
a statute's total silence and our initial assumption against such coverage, see
supra, at 390-391, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 657, we conclude that  [HN3] the phrase
""convicted in any court"" refers only to domestic courts, not to foreign courts.
Congress, of course, remains free to change this conclusion through statutory
amendment.

For these reasons, the judgment of the Third Circuit is reversed, and the case
is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

The Chief Justice took no part in the decision of this case.

DISSENT

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.

Gary Small, having recently emerged from three years in Japanese prison for
illegally importing weapons into that  [*395]  country, bought a gun in the
United States.  This violated 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) [18 USCS § 922(g)(1)], which
makes it unlawful for any person ""who has been convicted in any court of, a
crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year"" to possess a
firearm in or affecting commerce.  Yet the majority decides that Small's gun
possession did not violate the statute, because his prior convictions occurred
in a Japanese court rather than an American court.  In concluding that ""any""
means not what it says, but rather ""a subset of any,"" the Court distorts the
plain meaning of the statute and departs from established principles of
statutory construction.  I respectfully dissent.

I

In December 1992, Small shipped a 19-gallon electric water heater from the
United States to Okinawa, Japan, ostensibly as a present for someone in Okinawa.
App. to Brief for Appellant in No. 02-2785 (CA3), pp 507a-510a, 530a-531a, 534a,
598a (hereinafter Appellant's App.).  Small [**1759]  had sent two other water
heaters to Japan that same year.  Id., at 523a-527a.  Thinking it unusual for a
person to ship a water tank from overseas as a present, id., at 599a, Japanese
customs officials searched the heater and discovered 2 rifles, 8 semiautomatic
pistols, and 410 rounds of ammunition, id., at 603a-604a; id., at 262a, 267a,
277a.

The Japanese Government indicted Small on multiple counts of violating Japan's
weapons-control and customs laws.  Id., at 261a-262a.  Each offense was
punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.   333 F.3d 425, 426
(CA3 2003).  Small was tried before a three-judge court in Naha, Japan,
Appellant's App. 554a, convicted on all counts on April 14, 1994,  333 F.3d at
426, and sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment with credit for 320 days served,  id
., at 426, n. 1; Government's Brief in Support of Detention in Crim. No. 00-160
(WD Pa.), pp 3-4.  He was paroled on November 22, 1996, and  [***661]  his
parole terminated on May 26, 1998.   333 F.3d at 426, n. 1.

[*396]  A week after completing parole for his Japanese convictions, on June 2,
1998, Small purchased a 9-millimeter SWD Cobray pistol from a firearms dealer in
Pennsylvania.  Appellant's App. 48a, 98a.  Some time later, a search of his
residence, business premises, and automobile revealed a .380-caliber Browning
pistol and more than 300 rounds of ammunition. Id., at 47a-51a, 98a-99a.  This
prosecution ensued.

The plain terms of § 922(g)(1) prohibit Small--a person ""convicted in any court
of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year""--from
possessing a firearm in the United States.  ""Read naturally, the word 'any' has
an expansive meaning, that is, 'one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.'""

statute; ""[n]o modifier is present,  and nothing suggests any restriction,""
Lewis v. United States, 445 U.S. 55, 60, 63 L. Ed. 2d 198, 100 S. Ct. 915 (1980)
, on the scope of the term ""court."" See  Gonzales, supra, at 5, 137 L. Ed. 2d
132, 117 S. Ct. 1032, (statute referring to ""'any other term of imprisonment'""
includes no ""language limiting the breadth of that word, and so we must read
[the statute] as referring to all 'term[s] of  [*397]  imprisonment'"").  The
broad phrase ""any court"" unambiguously includes all judicial bodies 1 with
jurisdiction to impose [**1760]  the requisite conviction--a conviction for a
crime punishable by imprisonment for a term of more than a year.  Indisputably,
Small was convicted in a Japanese court of crimes punishable by a prison term
exceeding one year.  The clear terms of the statute prohibit him from possessing
a gun in the United States.

 Of course, the phrase ""any court,"" like all other statutory language, must be
read in context.  E.g.,  Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129, 132, 124 L. Ed. 2d
44, 113 S. Ct. 1993 (1993).   [***662]  The context of § 922(g)(1), however,
suggests that there is no geographic limit on the scope of ""any court."" 2 By
contrast to other parts of the firearms-control law that expressly mention only
state or federal law, ""any court"" is not qualified by jurisdiction.  See 18
U.S.C. § 921(a)(20) [18 USCS § 921(a)(20)] (excluding certain ""Federal or State
offenses"" from the definition of ""crime punishable by imprisonment for a term
exceeding one year""); § 921(a)(33)(A)(i) (defining a ""misdemeanor crime of
domestic violence"" by  [*398]  reference to ""Federal or State law""). 3 Congress'
explicit use of ""Federal"" and ""State"" in other provisions shows that it
specifies such restrictions when it wants to do so.

may not mean to include films shown in another city,"" ante, at 388, 161 L. Ed.
2d, at 656, therefore adds nothing to the analysis.  The context of that
statement implies that such a speaker, despite saying ""any,"" often means only
the subset of films within an accessible distance.  Unlike the context of the
film remark, the context of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) [18 USCS § 922(g)(1)] implies
no geographic restriction.

3 See also § 921(a)(15) (defining a ""fugitive from justice,"" who is banned from

sentence, by reference to particular federal laws or ""State law"").

Counting foreign convictions, moreover, implicates no special federalism
concerns or other clear statement rules that have justified construing ""any""
narrowly in the past. 4 And it is eminently practical to put foreign convictions
to the same use as domestic ones; foreign convictions indicate dangerousness
just as reliably as domestic convictions.  See Part III-B, infra. The expansive
phrase ""convicted in any court"" straightforwardly encompasses Small's Japanese
convictions.

provide the clear statement required for the Federal Government to limit the
States' ability to restrict delivery of such services by their own political

 III

Faced with the inescapably broad text, the Court narrows the statute by assuming
that the text applies only to domestic convictions, ante, at 388-389, 161 L. Ed.
2d, at 657-658; criticizing the accuracy of foreign convictions as a proxy for
dangerousness, ante, at 389-390, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 656-657; finding [**1761]
that the broad, natural reading of the statute ""creates anomalies,"" ante, at
391, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 658; and suggesting that Congress did not consider
whether foreign convictions counted, ante, at 393, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 658-659.
None of these arguments is persuasive.

[*399]  A

The Court first invents a canon of statutory interpretation--what it terms ""an
ordinary assumption about the reach of domestically oriented statutes,"" ante, at
390, 161 L. Ed. 2d,  [***663]  at 657--to cabin the statute's reach.  This new
""assumption"" imposes a clear statement rule on Congress: Absent a clear
statement, a statute refers to nothing outside the United States.  The Court's
denial that it has created a clear statement rule is implausible.  Ibid. After
today's ruling, the only way for Congress to ensure that courts will construe a
law to refer to foreign facts or entities is to describe those facts or entities
specifically as foreign.  If this is not a ""special burden of specificity,""
ibid., I am not sure what is.

The Court's innovation is baseless.  The Court derives its assumption from the
entirely different, and well-recognized, canon against extraterritorial
application of federal statutes: ""It is a longstanding principle of American law
that legislation of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears, is meant to
apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.""  EEOC v.
Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 248, 113 L. Ed. 2d 274, 111 S. Ct. 1227
(1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But the majority rightly concedes
that the canon against extraterritoriality itself ""does not apply directly to
this case.""  Ante, at 389, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 656.  Though foreign as well as
domestic convictions trigger § 922(g)(1)'s prohibition, the statute criminalizes
gun possession in this country, not abroad. In prosecuting Small, the Government
is enforcing a domestic criminal statute to punish domestic criminal conduct.
Pasquantino v United States, ante, at 544 U.S. 349, 371-372, 161 L. Ed. 2d 619,

defrauding a foreign government of tax revenue).

The extraterritoriality cases cited by the Court,  ante, at 389, 161 L. Ed. 2d,
at 656, do not support its new assumption.  They restrict federal statutes from
applying outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.  See  Smith

 [*410]  [**1810]   Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.

[HN1]  [***LEdHR1A]  The federal Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act
of 1996 (AEDPA) establishes a 1-year statute of limitations for filing a federal
habeas corpus petition.  28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1) [28 USCS § 2244(d)(1)].  That
limitations period is tolled, however, while ""a properly filed application for
State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent
judgment or claim is pending."" § 2244(d)(2).  This case requires us to decide
whether a state postconviction petition rejected by the state court as untimely
nonetheless is ""properly filed"" within the meaning of § 2244(d)(2).  We conclude
that it is not, and hold that petitioner John Pace's federal petition is time
barred.

In February 1986, petitioner pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and
possession of an instrument of crime in a Pennsylvania state court.  He was
sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.  Petitioner did
not file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and he did not file a direct
appeal.  In August 1986, he filed a petition under the Pennsylvania Post
Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 9541 et seq (1988) (amended
and renamed by Act No. 1988-47, §§ 3, 6, 1988 Pa. Laws pp 337-342).  These
proceedings concluded in September 1992, when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
denied petitioner's untimely request for discretionary review.

Over four years later, on November 27, 1996, petitioner filed another state
postconviction petition, this time under the Pennsylvania Post Conviction Relief
Act (PCRA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 9541 et seq (1998).  The PCRA had replaced the
PCHA in 1988 and was amended in 1995 to include, for the first time, a statute
of limitations for state postconviction  [*411]  petitions, with three
exceptions. 1 Although petitioner's PCRA petition was filed after the date upon
which the new time limits became effective, the petition said nothing about
timeliness.

1 The amended statute states that ""[a]ny"" postconviction petition, ""including a
second or subsequent petition, shall be filed within one year"" from the date the
petitioner's conviction becomes final.  42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 9545(b)(1) (1998).
However, three exceptions are provided: if governmental interference prevented
filing; if a new constitutional rule is made retroactive; or if new facts arise
that could not have been discovered through due diligence. §§
9545(b)(1)(i)-(iii).  A statutory note provides that the 1995 amendments ""shall
apply to petitions filed after [January 16, 1996]; however, a petitioner whose
judgment has become final on or before [January 16, 1996] shall be deemed to
have filed a timely petition . . . if the petitioner's first petition is filed
within one year of [January 16, 1996]."" Statutory Note on § 9545(b).

After reviewing petitioner's PCRA petition,  appointed counsel submitted a
""no-merit"" letter.  On July 23, 1997, the Court of Common Pleas dismissed the
petition, without calling for a response from the Commonwealth.  The court noted
that petitioner's claims previously had been litigated and were meritless.
Petitioner appealed.  On May 6, 1998, the Commonwealth filed a brief in
response, asserting that petitioner's  [***675]  PCRA petition was untimely
under the PCRA's time bar, § 9545(b), and citing as support  Commonwealth v.
Alcorn, 703 A.2d 1054 (Pa. Super. 1997).  On May 28, 1998, petitioner responded
by arguing that the time limit was inapplicable to him.  The Superior Court
dismissed his petition as untimely on December 3, 1998.  The Superior Court
reasoned that petitioner's PCRA petition did not come within the statutory
[**1811]  note following § 9545(b), see ibid., and that petitioner had ""neither
alleged nor proven"" that he fell within any statutory exception, see §§
9545(b)(1)(i)-(iii).  App. 316-317.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied
review on July 29, 1999.  Id., at 372.

On December 24, 1999, petitioner filed a federal habeas petition under 28 U.S.C.
§ 2254 [28 USCS § 2254] in the District Court for the  [*412]  Eastern District
of Pennsylvania.  The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal of the petition
under AEDPA's statute of limitations, § 2244(d)(1), but the District Court
rejected that recommendation, App. 447-466 (June 7, 2001, memorandum and order),
503-533 (Mar. 29, 2002, memorandum and order).  The District Court recognized
that, without tolling, petitioner's petition was time barred. 2 But it held that
petitioner was entitled to both statutory and equitable tolling for the time
during which his PCRA petition was pending--November 27, 1996 to July 29, 1999.
Beginning with statutory tolling, the District Court held that, even though the
state court rejected his PCRA petition as untimely, that did not prevent the
petition from being ""properly filed"" within the meaning of § 2244(d)(2).  It
reasoned that because the PCRA set up judicially reviewable exceptions to the
time limit, the PCRA time limit was not a ""condition to filing"" but a ""condition
to obtaining relief"" as we described those distinct concepts in  Artuz v.
Bennett, 531 U.S. 4, 11, 148 L. Ed. 2d 213, 121 S. Ct. 361 (2000).  The District
Court alternatively found extraordinary circumstances justifying equitable
tolling.

2 The District Court noted that, [HN2]  under Third Circuit precedent,
""petitioners whose convictions became final before the enactment of AEDPA's
statute of limitations on April 24, 1996 have until one year from the enactment
of the habeas statute of limitations to file their petitions."" App. 453, 503.
Without tolling, therefore, petitioner's federal habeas petition was filed well
after the April 1997 deadline.

 The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed.   Pace v. Vaughn, 71 Fed.
Appx. 127 (2003) (not precedential).  With regard to statutory tolling, it
relied on a line of Third Circuit cases to conclude that the PCRA time limit
constitutes a ""condition to filing"" and that, when a state court deems a
petition untimely, it is not ""properly filed.""  Id., at 128.  With regard to
equitable tolling, it held that there were not extraordinary circumstances
justifying that remedy.   Id., at 129.  Because Circuits have divided over
whether a state postconviction petition that the state court  [*413]  has
rejected as untimely nonetheless may be ""properly filed,"" we granted certiorari.
3 542 U.S. 965, 159 L. Ed. 2d 856, 125 S. Ct. 26 (2004).  We now affirm.

In  Artuz v. Bennett, supra, we held that time limits on postconviction
petitions are ""condition[s] to filing,"" such that an untimely petition would
[***676]  not be deemed ""properly filed.""  Id., at 8, 11, 148 L. Ed. 2d 213, 121
S. Ct. 361 (""[A]n application is 'properly filed' when its delivery and
acceptance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing
filings"" including ""time limits upon its delivery"").  However, we reserved the
question we face here: ""whether the existence of certain exceptions to a timely
filing requirement can prevent a late application from being considered
improperly filed.""  Id., at 8, n. 2, 148 L. Ed. 2d 213, 121 S. Ct. 361.  Having
now considered the question, we see no grounds for treating the two differently.

As in Artuz, we are guided by the ""common usage"" and ""commo[n] underst[anding]""
of the phrase ""properly filed.""  Id., at 8, 9, 148 L. Ed. 2d 213, 121 S. Ct. 361
.  In common understanding,  [**1812]  a petition filed after a time limit, and
which does not fit within any exceptions to that limit, is no more ""properly
filed"" than a petition filed after a time limit that permits no exception.  The
purpose of AEDPA's statute of limitations confirms this commonsense reading.  On
petitioner's theory, a state prisoner could toll the statute of limitations at
will simply by filing untimely state postconviction petitions.  This would turn
§ 2244(d)(2) into a de facto extension mechanism, quite contrary to the purpose
of AEDPA, and open the door to abusive delay.

Carey v. Saffold, 536 U.S. 214, 153 L. Ed. 2d 260, 122 S. Ct. 2134 (2002),
points to the same conclusion.  In Saffold, we considered whether § 2244(d)(2)
required tolling during the 412 months between the California appellate court's
denial of Saffold's postconviction petition and his further petition in the
California Supreme Court.  The California Supreme Court denied the petition ""on
the merits and for lack of diligence,"" which raised the  [*414]  question
whether that court had dismissed for lack of merit, for untimeliness, or for
both.   Id., at 225, 153 L. Ed. 2d 260, 122 S. Ct. 2134 (internal quotation
marks omitted).  Although we ultimately remanded, we explained that, ""[i]f the
California Supreme Court had clearly ruled that Saffold's 412-month delay was
'unreasonable,'"" i.e., untimely, ""that would be the end of the matter,
regardless of whether it also addressed the merits of the claim, or whether its
timeliness ruling was 'entangled' with the merits.""  Id., at 226, 153 L. Ed. 2d
260, 122 S. Ct. 2134 (emphasis added);  see also  id., at 236, 153 L. Ed. 2d
260, 122 S. Ct. 2134 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (""If the California court held
that all of [Saffold's] state habeas petitions were years overdue, then they
were not 'properly filed' at all, and there would be no tolling of the federal
limitations period"").  What we intimated in Saffold we now hold:  [HN3] When a
postconviction petition is untimely under state law, ""that [is] the end of the
matter"" for purposes of § 2244(d)(2).

Petitioner makes three principal arguments against this reading.  First, he
asserts that ""condition[s] to filing"" are merely those conditions necessary to
get a clerk to accept the petition, as opposed to conditions that require some
judicial consideration.  Respondent David DiGuglielmo (hereinafter respondent)
characterizes petitioner's position, which the dissent also appears to embrace,
see  post, at 462, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 683-684, as a juridical game of ""hot
potato,"" in which a petition will be ""properly filed"" so long as a petitioner is
able to hand it to the clerk  [***677]  without the clerk tossing it back.
Brief for Respondent 16.  Be that as it may, petitioner's theory is inconsistent
with Artuz, where we explained that jurisdictional matters and fee payments,
both of which often necessitate judicial scrutiny, are ""condition[s] to filing.""
4 See  531 U.S., at 9, 148 L. Ed. 2d 213, 121 S. Ct. 361.  We  [*415]  fail to
see how timeliness is any less a ""filing"" requirement than the mechanical rules
that are enforceable by clerks, if such rules exist. 5 [**1813]  For example,
Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 901 (2005), which is entitled
""Initiation of Post-Conviction Collateral Proceedings,"" lists two mandatory
conditions: (A) the petition ""shall"" be filed within the time limit, and (B) the
proceedings ""shall be initiated by filing"" a verified petition and ""3 copies
with the clerk of the court in which the defendant was convicted and sentenced.""
The natural reading is that (A) is every bit as much of a ""condition to filing""
as (B).

4 With regard to jurisdiction, see, e.g., Commonwealth v. Judge, 568 Pa. 377,
387-389, 797 A.2d 250, 257 (2002) (Pennsylvania court had jurisdiction over PCRA
petition, despite the fact the petitioner was not in Pennsylvania custody).
With regard to filing fees, see, e.g., Pa. Rule Crim. Proc. 904(F) (2005) (""When
a defendant satisfies the judge that the defendant is unable to pay the costs of
the post-conviction collateral proceedings, the judge shall order that the
defendant be permitted to proceed in forma pauperis"").

5 Perhaps not unintentionally, petitioner fails to provide us any guidance on
exactly which Pennsylvania Rules are subject to a clerk's striking for
noncompliance.  We doubt there are many such rules, both because few truly
mechanical rules exist and because the role of the clerk in refusing petitions
in most courts is quite limited.  See, e.g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 5(e) (""The
clerk shall not refuse to accept for filing any paper presented for that purpose
solely because it is not presented in proper form as required by these rules or
any local rules or practices""); 28 U.S.C. § 2254 Rule 3(b) (2000 ed., Supp. IV)
[USCS Court Rules, § 2254 Rules, Rule 3(b)], (""The clerk must file the petition
and enter it on the docket""); see also Advisory Committee's Note on Habeas
Corpus Rule 3(b), 28 U.S.C. p 42 (2000 ed., Supp. IV) [USCS Court Rules, § 2254
Rules, Notes following Rule 3] (""Rule 3(b) requires the clerk to file a
petition, even though it may otherwise fail to comply with Rule 2.  This rule .
. . is not limited to those instances where the petition is defective only in
form; the clerk would also be required, for example, to file the petition even
though it lacked the requisite filing fee or an in forma pauperis form"").
Indeed, not even filing in the right court would be a ""condition to filing""
under petitioner's limited theory.  See 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5103(a) (2004)
(instructing that, when a petition is filed in the wrong court, it is not to be
stricken but transferred to the proper court).  Under this theory, ""filing""
conditions may be an empty set.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 Petitioner also argues that, because § 2244(d)(2) refers to a ""properly filed
application,"" then any condition that must be applied on a claim-by-claim basis,
such as Pennsylvania's time limit, cannot be a ""condition to filing."" (Emphasis
added.) Section 2244, however, refutes this position.  Section 2244(b)(3)(C),
for example, states that the court of appeals  [*416]  ""may authorize the filing
of a second or successive application only if it determines that the application
makes a prima facie showing that the application satisfies the requirements of
this subsection."" (Emphases added.) Yet the ""requirements"" of the subsection are
not applicable to the application as a whole; instead, they require inquiry into
specific ""claim[s]."" See § 2244(b)(2)(A) (""claim"" relies on a new rule made
retroactive); § 2244(b)(2)(B) (""claim"" with new factual predicate). 6 In fact,
petitioner's argument is inconsistent with  [HN4] § 2244(d)(2) itself, which
refers not  [***678]  just to a ""properly filed application,"" but to a ""properly
filed application . . . with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim.""
(Emphasis added.)

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - Footnotes - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

6 Similarly,  [HN5] § 2244(d)(1) provides that a ""1-year period of limitation
shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus."" (Emphasis added.)
The subsection then provides one means of calculating the limitation with regard
to the ""application"" as a whole, § 2244(d)(1)(A) (date of final judgment), but
three others that require claim-by-claim consideration, § 2244(d)(1)(B)
(governmental interference); § 2244(d)(1)(C) (new right made retroactive); §
2244(d)(1)(D) (new factual predicate).

 Finally, petitioner challenges the fairness of our interpretation.  He claims
that a ""petitioner trying in good faith to exhaust state remedies may litigate
in state court for years only to find out at the end that he was never 'properly
filed,'"" and thus that his federal habeas petition is time barred. Brief for
Petitioner 30.  A prisoner seeking state postconviction relief might avoid this
predicament, however, by filing a ""protective"" petition in federal court and
asking the federal court to stay and abey the federal habeas proceedings until
state remedies are exhausted.  See  Rhines v Weber, ante, at 278, 544 U.S. 269,
161 L. Ed. 2d 440, 125 S. Ct. 1528.   [HN6] A petitioner's reasonable confusion
about whether a state filing would be timely will ordinarily constitute ""good
cause"" for him to file in federal court.  Ibid. (""[I]f the petitioner had good
cause for his failure [**1814]  to exhaust, his unexhausted claims are
potentially meritorious, and there is no indication that the petitioner engaged
in intentionally  [*417]  dilatory tactics,"" then the district court likely
""should stay, rather than dismiss, the mixed petition"").

The dissent suggests that our conclusion in Artuz, that state procedural bars
""prescrib[ing] a rule of decision for a court"" confronted with certain claims
previously adjudicated or not properly presented are not ""filing"" conditions,
requires the conclusion that the time limit at issue here also is not a ""filing""
condition.   Post, at 425-426, 161 L. Ed. 2d at 683-684; see  Artuz v. Bennett,
531 U.S., at 10-11, 148 L. Ed. 2d 213, 121 S. Ct. 361 (discussing N. Y. Crim.
Proc. Law §§ 440.10(2)(a) and (c) (McKinney 1994)).  The dissent ignores the
fact that Artuz itself distinguished between time limits and procedural bars.
531 U.S., at 8-10, 148 L. Ed. 2d 213, 121 S. Ct. 361.  For purposes of
determining what are ""filing"" conditions, there is an obvious distinction
between time limits, which go to the very initiation of a petition and a court's
ability to consider that petition, and the type of ""rule of decision"" procedural
bars at issue in Artuz, which go to the ability to obtain relief. 7 Far from
requiring ""verbal gymnastics,"" it must be the case that a petition that cannot
even be initiated or considered due to the failure to include a timely claim is
not ""properly filed.""  Id., at 10, 148 L. Ed. 2d 213, 121 S. Ct. 361.

Post-Conviction Collateral Proceedings"" and listing compliance with the time
limit as one mandatory condition); 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 9545(b) (2002) (titled
""Jurisdiction and proceedings"" and listing the time limit);  Commonwealth v.
Fahy, 558 Pa. 313, 328, 737 A.2d 214, 222 (1999) (describing the time limit as
""jurisdictional""); 2 Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (2004-2005) (stating that a
court ""shall not entertain"" a time-barred petition), with 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. §

like those at issue in Artuz); 2 Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(a) (2004-2005)

bars, like those at issue in Artuz, are present).

 For these reasons, we hold that  [HN7] time limits, no matter their form, are
[***679]  ""filing"" conditions.  Because the state court rejected petitioner's
PCRA petition as untimely, it was not ""properly filed,"" and he is not entitled
to statutory tolling under § 2244(d)(2).

[***LEdHR2A]   [***LEdHR3] [3]  [***LEdHR4A]   [*418]  We now turn to
petitioner's argument that he is entitled to equitable tolling for the time
during which his untimely PCRA petition was pending in the state courts. 8
[HN8] Generally, a litigant seeking equitable tolling bears the burden of
establishing two elements: (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently,
and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.  See, e.g.,
Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 96, 112 L. Ed. 2d 435, 111
S. Ct. 453 (1990).  Petitioner argues that he has satisfied the extraordinary
circumstance test.  He reasons that Third Circuit law at the time he sought
relief required him to exhaust his state remedies and thus seek PCRA relief,
even if it was unlikely the state court would reach the merits of his claims,
and that state law made it appear as though he might gain relief, despite the
petition's untimeliness. Thus, he claims, ""state law and Third Circuit
exhaustion law created a trap"" on which he detrimentally relied as [**1815]  his
federal time limit slipped away.  Brief for Petitioner 34.  Even if we were to
accept petitioner's theory, he would not be entitled to relief because he has
not established the requisite diligence.

8  [***LEdHR2A]  We have never squarely addressed the question whether equitable
tolling is applicable to AEDPA's statute of limitations. Cf.  Pliler v. Ford,
542 U.S. 225, 159 L. Ed. 2d 338, 124 S. Ct. 2441 (2004).  Because respondent
assumes that equitable tolling applies and because petitioner is not entitled to
equitable tolling under any standard, we assume without deciding its application
for purposes of this case.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 [***LEdHR4A]  Petitioner's PCRA petition set forth three claims: that his
sentence was ""illegal""; that his plea was invalid because he did not understand
his life sentence was without the possibility of parole; and that he received
ineffective assistance of counsel at ""all levels of representation."" App. 202,
220.  The first two of these claims were available to petitioner as early as
1986.  Indeed,  petitioner asserted a version of his invalid plea claim in his
August 21, 1986, PCHA petition.  See id., at 144.  The third claim--ineffective
assistance of  [*419]  counsel--related only to events occurring in or before
1991.  See id., at 191.

Yet petitioner waited years, without any valid justification, to assert these
claims in his November 27, 1996, PCRA petition. 9 Had petitioner advanced his
claims within a reasonable time of their availability, he would not now be
facing any time problem, state or federal. 10 And not only did petitioner sit on
his rights for years before he filed his PCRA petition, but he also sat on them
for five more months after his PCRA proceedings became final before deciding to
seek relief in federal court.  See id., at 372, 373.  Under long-established
principles, petitioner's lack of diligence precludes equity's  [***680]
operation.  See  Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, supra, at 96, 112 L.
Ed. 2d 435, 111 S. Ct. 453;  McQuiddy v. Ware, 87 U.S. 14, 20 Wall. 14, 19, 22
L. Ed. 311 (1874)  [HN9] (""Equity always refuses to interfere where there has
been gross laches in the prosecution of rights"").

9 Petitioner's PCRA petition did cite allegedly ""new"" evidence to support his
claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that his plea was
invalid because he did not understand his life sentence was without the
possibility of parole.  However, this new evidence was not new at all: It
consisted of affidavits from petitioner's parents and brother regarding a
meeting they attended with petitioner's counsel and petitioner in 1985 or 1986.
App. 195-199.

10 As noted previously, the PCRA time limit only came into effect in January
1996, see n 1, supra, and petitioner's federal habeas petition was due in April
1997, see n 2, supra.

Because petitioner filed his federal habeas petition beyond the deadline, and
because he was not entitled to statutory or equitable tolling for any of that
period, his federal petition is barred by the statute of limitations. The
judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer
join, dissenting.

Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA),
prisoners in state custody have a 1-year  [*420]  window in which they may file
a federal habeas corpus petition.  28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1) [28 USCS § 2244(d)(1)
].  The statute provides, however, for tolling of the statute of limitations
during the pendency of any ""properly filed application for State post-conviction
or other collateral review."" § 2244(d)(2).  Under the interpretation of that
statutory provision adopted by the Court today, a petition for state
postconviction relief does not constitute a ""properly filed application for . .
. collateral review,"" even if the application has been accepted, filed, and
reviewed in full by the state court.  The Court's chosen rule means that a state
application will not be deemed properly filed--no matter how long the state
court has held the petition, how carefully it has reviewed the merits of the
petition's claims, or how it has justified its decision--if the court ultimately
[**1816]  determines that particular claims contained in the application fail to
comply with the applicable state statute of limitations.  The Court's
interpretation of § 2244(d)(2) is not compelled by the text of that provision
and will most assuredly frustrate its purpose. 1

I

The words ""properly filed application for . . .  collateral review"" are not
defined in AEDPA.  We did, however, interpret those words in  Artuz v. Bennett,
531 U.S. 4, 148 L. Ed. 2d 213, 121 S. Ct. 361 (2000), by considering their
ordinary meaning in the context of the statutory scheme in which they appear.
This Court has long understood that a ""paper is filed when it is delivered to
the proper official and by him received and filed.""  United States v. Lombardo,
241 U.S. 73, 76, 60 L. Ed. 897, 36 S. Ct. 508 (1916).  In Artuz, we expanded
upon that understanding, explaining that an ""application is 'filed,' as that
term is commonly understood, when it is delivered to, and accepted by, the
appropriate court officer for placement into the official record.  And an
[*421]  application is 'properly filed' when its delivery and acceptance are in
compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings.""  531 U.S., at
8, 148 L. Ed. 2d 213, 121 S. Ct. 361 (citations omitted).  Because applications
and claims are distinct, we held that a petitioner's application for  [***681]
postconviction review is ""properly filed"" even when his legal claims are
procedurally barred under state law.

Artuz left open the question presented here--whether a state statute of
limitations that allows certain categories of petitioners to file otherwise late
applications is comparable to a general precondition to filing (such as the
payment of a filing fee) or is instead more akin to a procedural bar that
prevents a court from considering particular claims.   Id., at 8-9, n. 2, 148 L.
Ed. 2d 213, 121 S. Ct. 361.  If the state time bar at issue here is more like
the former, Pace's failure to comply with it would make his application
improperly filed under AEDPA.  If, however, the state time bar is more like the
procedural bar in Artuz, Pace's failure to comply with it would not change the
fact that his application was ""properly filed."" Before answering that question,
it is useful to explain why the state court ultimately found Pace's application
to be untimely.

II

Pace filed the application in question--his second request for state
postconviction review--pro se on November 27, 1996, under the Pennsylvania Post
Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 9541 et seq (1998). 2 Pace's
[*422]  PCRA petition raised two claims that he alleged had not been presented
during his first round of postconviction review: first, that his
life-without-parole sentence was unconstitutional under state and federal law;
and second, that his guilty plea colloquy violated due process.  Pace provided
new evidence that he had not presented during his [**1817]  first round of
postconviction review, see App. 191, 195-201, and explained to the court that
his two new claims should not be procedurally barred because they had not been
""fully litigated or waived"" under state law, id., at 191. Pace's justifications
for raising these two new claims make plain that he was attempting to fit his
application within the commonly recognized judicial exceptions to Pennsylvania's
then-applicable state procedural bars. 3

2 Pace's conviction became final in 1986, long before the Pennsylvania
Legislature adopted the PCRA's current statute of limitations.  Pace's original
petition for postconviction relief was filed under the Pennsylvania Post
Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 9541 et seq. (1988) (amended
and renamed by Act No. 1988-47, §§ 3, 6, 1988 Pa. Laws pp 337-342), which did
not include a statute of limitations. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied
Pace's request for review on September 3, 1992.  The PCRA time bar did not
become effective until January 16, 1996.  See Act No. 1995-32, § 9579, 1995 Pa.
Laws pp. 1125-1126 (Spec. Sess. 1).

"             Linda Lingle, Governor of Hawaii, et al., Petitioners v.                               Chevron U.S.A. Inc.",544 U.S. 528,"

 [*531]  [**2077]  [***883]    JUSTICE O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the
Court.

On occasion, a would-be doctrinal rule or test finds its way into our case law
through simple repetition of a phrase -- however fortuitously coined. A quarter
century ago, in  Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255, 65 L. Ed. 2d 106, 100
S. Ct. 2138 (1980), the Court declared that government regulation of private
property ""effects a taking if [such regulation] does not substantially advance
legitimate state interests . . . .""  447 U.S., at 260, 65 L. Ed. 2d 106, 100 S.
Ct. 2138. Through reiteration in a half dozen or so  [**2078] decisions since
Agins, this  [*532]  language has been ensconced in our Fifth Amendment takings
jurisprudence. See  Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687,
704, 143 L. Ed. 2d 882, 119 S. Ct. 1624 (1999) (citing cases).

In the case before us, the lower courts applied Agins'""substantially advances""
formula to strike down a Hawaii statute that limits the rent that oil companies
may charge to dealers who lease service stations owned by the companies. The
lower courts held that the rent cap effects an uncompensated taking of private
[***884]  property in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments because
it does not substantially advance Hawaii's asserted interest in controlling
retail gasoline prices. This case requires us to decide whether the
""substantially advances"" formula announced in Agins is an appropriate test for
determining whether a regulation effects a Fifth Amendment taking. We conclude
that it is not.

I

The State of Hawaii, whose territory comprises an archipelago of 132 islands
clustered in the midst of the Pacific Ocean, is located over 1,600 miles from
the U.S. mainland and ranks among the least populous of the 50 States. Because
of Hawaii's small size and geographic isolation, its wholesale market for oil
products is highly concentrated. When this lawsuit began in 1997, only two
refineries and six gasoline wholesalers were doing business in the State. As of
that time, respondent Chevron U.S.A. Inc. was the largest refiner and marketer
of gasoline in Hawaii: It controlled 60 percent of the market for gasoline
produced or refined in-state and 30 percent of the wholesale market on the
State's most populous island, Oahu.

Gasoline is sold at retail in Hawaii from about 300 different service stations.
About half of these stations are leased from oil companies by independent
lessee-dealers, another 75 or so are owned and operated by ""open"" dealers, and
the remainder are owned and operated by the oil companies. Chevron sells most of
its product through 64 independent [*533]  lessee-dealer stations. In a typical
lessee-dealer arrangement, Chevron buys or leases land from a third party,
builds a service station, and then leases the station to a dealer on a turnkey
basis. Chevron charges the lessee-dealer a monthly rent, defined as a percentage
of the dealer's margin on retail sales of gasoline and other goods. In addition,
Chevron requires the lessee-dealer to enter into a supply contract, under which
the dealer agrees to purchase from Chevron whatever is necessary to satisfy
demand at the station for Chevron's product. Chevron unilaterally sets the
wholesale price of its product.

The Hawaii Legislature enacted Act 257 in June 1997, apparently in response to
concerns about the effects of market concentration on retail gasoline prices.
See 1997 Haw. Sess. Laws no. 257, § 1.  [HN1] The statute seeks to protect
independent dealers by imposing certain restrictions on the ownership and
leasing of service stations by oil companies. It prohibits oil companies from
converting existing lessee-dealer stations to company-operated stations and from
locating new company-operated stations in close proximity to existing
dealer-operated stations. Haw. Rev. Stat. §§ 486H-10.4(a), (b) (1998 Cum.
Supp.). More importantly for present purposes, Act 257 limits the amount of rent
that an oil company may charge a lessee-dealer to 15 percent of the dealer's
gross profits from gasoline sales plus 15 percent of gross sales of products
other than gasoline. § 486H-10.4(c).

Thirty days after Act 257's enactment, Chevron sued the Governor and Attorney
[**2079]  General of Hawaii in their official capacities (collectively Hawaii)
in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii, raising several
federal constitutional challenges to the statute. As pertinent here, Chevron
claimed that the  [***885]  statute's rent cap provision, on its face, effected
a taking of Chevron's property in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendments. Chevron sought a declaration to this effect as well as an injunction
against the application of the rent cap to its stations. Chevron swiftly  [*534]
moved for summary judgment on its takings claim, arguing that the rent cap does
not substantially advance any legitimate government interest. Hawaii filed a
cross-motion for summary judgment on all of Chevron's claims.

To facilitate resolution of the summary judgment motions, the parties jointly
stipulated to certain relevant facts. They agreed that Act 257 reduces by about
$ 207,000 per year the aggregate rent that Chevron would otherwise charge on 11
of its 64 lessee-dealer stations. On the other hand, the statute allows Chevron
to collect more rent than it would otherwise charge at its remaining 53
lessee-dealer stations, such that Chevron could increase its overall rental
income from all 64 stations by nearly $ 1.1 million per year. The parties
further stipulated that, over the past 20 years, Chevron has not fully recovered
the costs of maintaining lessee-dealer stations in any State through rent alone.
Rather, the company recoups its expenses through a combination of rent and
product sales. Finally, the joint stipulation states that Chevron has earned in
the past, and anticipates that it will continue to earn under Act 257, a return
on its investment in lessee-dealer stations in Hawaii that satisfies any
constitutional standard.

The District Court granted summary judgment to Chevron, holding that ""Act 257
fails to substantially advance a legitimate state interest, and as such, effects
an unconstitutional taking in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.""
Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Cayetano, 57 F. Supp. 2d 1003, 1014 (1998). The District
Court accepted Hawaii's argument that the rent cap was intended to prevent
concentration of the retail gasoline market -- and, more importantly, resultant
high prices for consumers -- by maintaining the viability of independent
lessee-dealers.  Id., at 1009-1010. The court concluded that the statute would
not substantially advance this interest, however, because it would not actually
reduce lessee-dealers' costs or retail prices. It found that the rent cap would
allow incumbent [*535]  lessee-dealers, upon transferring occupancy rights to a
new lessee, to charge the incoming lessee a premium reflecting the value of the
rent reduction. Accordingly, the District Court reasoned, the incoming lessee's
overall expenses would be the same as in the absence of the rent cap, so there
would be no savings to pass along to consumers.  Id., at 1010-1012. Nor would
incumbent lessees benefit from the rent cap, the court found, because the oil
company lessors would unilaterally raise wholesale fuel prices in order to
offset the reduction in their rental income.  Id., at 1012-1014.

On appeal, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held
that the District Court had applied the correct legal standard to Chevron's
takings claim.  Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Cayetano, 224 F.3d 1030, 1033-1037 (2000)
. The Court of Appeals vacated the grant of summary judgment, however, on the
ground that a genuine issue of material fact remained as to whether the Act
would benefit consumers.  Id., at 1037-1042. Judge William Fletcher  [***886]
concurred in the judgment, maintaining that the ""reasonableness"" standard
applicable to ""ordinary rent and price control  [**2080]  laws"" should instead
govern Chevron's claim.  Id., at 1048.

On remand, the District Court entered judgment for Chevron after a 1-day bench
trial in which Chevron and Hawaii called competing expert witnesses (both
economists) to testify.  198 F. Supp. 2d 1182 (2002). Finding Chevron's expert
witness to be ""more persuasive"" than the State's expert, the District Court once
again concluded that oil companies would raise wholesale gasoline prices to
offset any rent reduction required by Act 257, and that the result would be an
increase in retail gasoline prices.  Id., at 1187-1189. Even if the rent cap did
reduce lessee-dealers' costs, the court found, they would not pass on any
savings to consumers.  Id., at 1189. The court went on to reiterate its
determination that Act 257 would enable incumbent lessee-dealers to sell their
leaseholds at a premium, such that incoming lessees would not  [*536]  obtain
any of the benefits of the rent cap.  Id., at 1189-1190. And while it
acknowledged that the rent cap could preclude oil companies from constructively
evicting dealers through excessive rents, the court found no evidence that
Chevron or any other oil company would attempt to charge such rents in the
absence of the cap.  Id., at 1191. Finally, the court concluded that Act 257
would in fact decrease the number of lessee-dealer stations because the rent cap
would discourage oil companies from building such stations.  Id., at 1191-1192.
Based on these findings, the District Court held that ""Act 257 effected an
unconstitutional regulatory taking given its failure to substantially advance
any legitimate state interest.""  Id., at 1193.

The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that its decision in the prior appeal barred
Hawaii from challenging the application of the ""substantially advances"" test to
Chevron's takings claim or from arguing for a more deferential standard of
review.  363 F.3d 846, 849-855 (2004). The panel majority went on to reject
Hawaii's challenge to the application of the standard to the facts of the case.
Id., at 855-858. Judge Fletcher dissented, renewing his contention that Act 257
should not be reviewed under the ""substantially advances"" standard.  Id., at
859-861. We granted certiorari, 543 U.S. 924, 125 S. Ct. 314, 160 L. Ed. 2d 221
(2004), and now reverse.

[HN2] The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, made applicable to the States
through the Fourteenth, see  Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U.S. 226,
41 L. Ed. 979, 17 S. Ct. 581 (1897), provides that private property shall not
""be taken for public use, without just compensation."" As its text makes plain,
the Takings Clause ""does not prohibit the taking of private property, but
instead places a condition on the exercise of that power.""  First English
Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U.S. 304,
314, 96 L. Ed. 2d 250, 107 S. Ct. 2378 (1987). In other  [*537]  words, it ""is
designed not to limit the governmental interference with property rights per se,
but rather to secure compensation in the event of otherwise proper interference
amounting to a taking.""  482 U.S., at 315, 96 L. Ed. 2d  [***887]  250, 107 S.
Ct. 2378 (emphasis in original). While scholars have offered various
justifications for this regime, we have emphasized its role in ""barring
Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all
fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.""  Armstrong v.
United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1554, 80 S. Ct. 1563 (1960); see
also  Monongahela Nav. Co. v. United States, 148 U.S. 312, 325, 37 L. Ed. 463,
13 S. Ct. 622 (1893).

[**2081]  The paradigmatic taking requiring just compensation is a direct
government appropriation or physical invasion of private property.  See, e.g.,
United States v. Pewee Coal Co., 341 U.S. 114, 95 L. Ed. 809, 71 S. Ct. 670, 119
Ct. Cl. 851 (1951) (Government's seizure and operation of a coal mine to prevent
a national strike of coal miners effected a taking);  United States v. General
Motors Corp., 323 U.S. 373, 89 L. Ed. 311, 65 S. Ct. 357 (1945) (Government's
occupation of private warehouse effected a taking). Indeed, until the Court's
watershed decision in  Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 67 L. Ed.
322, 43 S. Ct. 158 (1922), ""it was generally thought that the Takings Clause
reached only a 'direct appropriation' of property, or the functional equivalent
of a 'practical ouster of [the owner's] possession.'""  Lucas v. South Carolina
Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1014, 120 L. Ed. 2d 798, 112 S. Ct. 2886 (1992)
(citations omitted and emphasis added; brackets in original); see also  505 U.S.
, at 1028, n. 15, 120 L. Ed. 2d 798, 112 S. Ct. 2886 (""Early constitutional
theorists did not believe the Takings Clause embraced regulations of property at
all"").

Beginning with Mahon, however, the Court recognized that government regulation
of private property may, in some instances, be so onerous that its effect is
tantamount to a direct appropriation or ouster -- and that such ""regulatory
takings"" may be compensable under the Fifth Amendment. In Justice Holmes'
storied but cryptic formulation, ""while property may be regulated to a certain
extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.""  260
U.S.,  [*538]  at 415, 67 L. Ed. 2d 322, 43 S. Ct. 158. The rub, of course, has
been -- and remains -- how to discern how far is ""too far."" In answering that
question, we must remain cognizant that ""government regulation -- by definition
-- involves the adjustment of rights for the public good,""  Andrus v. Allard,
444 U.S. 51, 65, 62 L. Ed. 2d 210, 100 S. Ct. 318 (1979), and that ""Government
hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be
diminished without paying for every such change in the general law,""  Mahon,
supra, 260 U.S., at 413, 67 L. Ed. 322, 43 S. Ct. 158.

Our precedents stake out two categories of regulatory action that generally will
be deemed per se takings for Fifth Amendment purposes. First, where government
requires an owner to suffer a permanent physical invasion of her property --
however minor -- it must provide just compensation. See  Loretto v. Teleprompter
Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 73 L. Ed. 2d 868, 102 S. Ct. 3164 (1982)
(state law requiring landlords to permit cable companies to install cable
facilities in apartment buildings effected a taking). A second categorical rule
applies to regulations that completely deprive an owner of ""all economically
beneficial us[e]"" of her property.  Lucas, 505 U.S., at 1019, 120 L. Ed. 2d 798,
112 S.  [***888]  Ct. 2886 (emphasis in original). We held in Lucas that the
government must pay just compensation for such ""total regulatory takings,""
except to the extent that ""background principles of nuisance and property law""
independently restrict the owner's intended use of the property.  505 U.S., at
1026-1032, 120 L. Ed. 2d 798, 112 S. Ct. 2886.

Outside these two relatively narrow categories (and the special context of
land-use exactions discussed below, see infra, at 546-548), regulatory takings
challenges are governed by the standards set forth in  Penn Central Transp. Co.
v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 57 L. Ed. 2d 631, 98 S. Ct. 2646 (1978). The
Court in Penn Central acknowledged that it had hitherto been ""unable to develop
any 'set formula'"" for evaluating regulatory takings claims, but identified
""several factors that have particular significance.""  Id., 438 U.S., at 124, 57
L. Ed. 2d 631, 98 S. Ct. 2646. Primary among those factors are ""the economic
impact of the regulation  [**2082] on the  [*539]  claimant and, particularly,
the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct
investment-backed expectations."" Ibid. In addition, the ""character of the
governmental action"" -- for instance whether it amounts to a physical invasion
or instead merely affects property interests through ""some public program
adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good""
-- may be relevant in discerning whether a taking has occurred. Ibid. The Penn
Central factors -- though each has given rise to vexing subsidiary questions --
have served as the principal guidelines for resolving regulatory takings claims
that do not fall within the physical takings or Lucas rules. See, e.g.,
Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, 533 U.S. 606, 617-618, 150 L. Ed. 2d 592, 121 S. Ct.
2448 (2001);  533 U.S., at 632-634, 150 L. Ed. 2d 592, 121 S. Ct. 2448
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring).

Although our regulatory takings jurisprudence cannot be characterized as
unified, these three inquiries (reflected in Loretto, Lucas, and Penn Central)
share a common touchstone.  [HN3] Each aims to identify regulatory actions that
are functionally equivalent to the classic taking in which government directly
appropriates private property or ousts the owner from his domain. Accordingly,
each of these tests focuses directly upon the severity of the burden that
government imposes upon private property rights. The Court has held that
physical takings require compensation because of the unique burden they impose:
A permanent physical invasion, however minimal the economic cost it entails,
eviscerates the owner's right to exclude others from entering and using her
property -- perhaps the most fundamental of all property interests. See  Dolan
v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374, 384, 129 L. Ed. 2d 304, 114 S. Ct. 2309 (1994);
Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U.S. 825, 831-832, 97 L. Ed. 2d 677,
107 S. Ct. 3141 (1987);  Loretto, supra, 458 U.S., at 433, 73 L. Ed. 2d 868, 102
S. Ct. 3164;  Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U.S. 164, 176, 62 L. Ed. 2d
332, 100 S. Ct. 383 (1979). In the Lucas context, of course, the complete
elimination of a property's value is the determinative factor. See  Lucas, supra
, 505 U.S., at 1017, 120 L. Ed. 2d 798, 112 S. Ct. 2886 (positing that ""total
deprivation of beneficial use is, from the landowner's point of view, the
equivalent of a physical [*540]  appropriation""). And the  [***889]  Penn
Central inquiry turns in large part, albeit not exclusively, upon the magnitude
of a regulation's economic impact and the degree to which it interferes with
legitimate property interests.

B

In Agins v. City of Tiburon, a case involving a facial takings challenge to
certain municipal zoning ordinances, the Court declared that ""the application of
a general zoning law to particular property effects a taking if the ordinance
does not substantially advance legitimate state interests, see  Nectow v.
Cambridge, 277 U.S. 183, 188, 72 L. Ed. 842, 48 S. Ct. 447 (1928), or denies an
owner economically viable use of his land, see  Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New
York City, 438 U.S. 104, 138, n. 36, 57 L. Ed. 2d 631, 98 S. Ct. 2646 (1978).""
447 U.S., at 260, 65 L. Ed. 2d 106, 100 S. Ct. 2138. Because this statement is
phrased in the disjunctive, Agins'""substantially advances"" language has been
read to announce a stand-alone regulatory takings test that is wholly
independent of Penn Central or any other test. Indeed, the lower courts in this
case struck down Hawaii's rent control statute based solely upon their findings
that it does not substantially advance a legitimate state interest. See supra,
at 534, 536. Although a number of our takings precedents have recited the
""substantially advances""  [**2083] formula minted in Agins, this is our first
opportunity to consider its validity as a freestanding takings test. We conclude
that this formula prescribes an inquiry in the nature of a due process, not a
takings, test, and that it has no proper place in our takings jurisprudence.

There is no question that the ""substantially advances"" formula was derived from
due process, not takings, precedents. In support of this new language, Agins
cited  Nectow v. Cambridge, 277 U.S. 183, 72 L. Ed. 842, 48 S. Ct. 447, a 1928
case in which the plaintiff claimed that a city zoning ordinance ""deprived him
of his property without due process of law in contravention of the Fourteenth
Amendment,""  277 U.S., at 185, 72 L. Ed. 842, 48 S. Ct. 447. Agins then went on
to discuss  Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365,  [*541]  71 L.
Ed. 303, 47 S. Ct. 114, 4 Ohio Law Abs. 816 (1926), a historic decision holding
that a municipal zoning ordinance would survive a substantive due process
challenge so long as it was not ""clearly arbitrary and unreasonable, having no
substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare.""
272 U.S., at 395, 71 L. Ed. 303, 47 S. Ct. 114 (emphasis added); see also
Nectow, supra, 277 U.S., at 187-188, 72 L. Ed. 842, 48 S. Ct. 447 (quoting the
same ""substantial relation"" language from Euclid).

When viewed in historical context, the Court's reliance on Nectow and Euclid is
understandable. Agins was the Court's first case involving a challenge to zoning
regulations in many decades, so it was natural to turn to these seminal zoning
precedents for guidance. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Agins
v. City of Tiburon, O. T. 79-602, pp. 12-13 (arguing that Euclid ""set out the
principles applicable to a determination of the facial validity of a zoning
ordinance attacked as a violation of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment
""). Moreover,  [***890]  Agins' apparent commingling of due process and takings
inquiries had some precedent in the Court's then-recent decision in Penn Central
. See  438 U.S., at 127, 57 L. Ed. 2d 631, 98 S. Ct. 2646 (stating in dicta that
""it is . . . implicit in  Goldblatt [v. Hempstead, 369 U.S. 590, 8 L. Ed. 2d
130, 82 S. Ct. 987 (1962),] that a use restriction on real property may
constitute a 'taking' if not reasonably necessary to the effectuation of a
substantial public purpose, see  Nectow v. Cambridge, supra ""). But see
Goldblatt, supra, 369 U.S., at 594-595, 8 L. Ed. 2d 130, 82 S. Ct. 987 (quoting
""'reasonably necessary'"" language from  Lawton v. Steele, 152 U.S. 133, 137, 38
L. Ed. 385, 14 S. Ct. 499 (1894), a due process case, and applying a deferential
""'reasonableness'"" standard to determine whether a challenged regulation was a
""valid exercise of the . . . police power"" under the Due Process Clause).
Finally, when Agins was decided, there had been some history of referring to
deprivations of property without due process of law as ""takings,"" see, e.g.,
Rowan v. United States Post Office Dep't, 397 U.S. 728, 740, 25 L. Ed. 2d 736,
90 S. Ct. 1484 (1970), and the Court had yet to clarify whether ""regulatory
takings"" claims were properly cognizable under the Takings Clause or the Due
Process Clause,  [*542]  see  Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v.
Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.S. 172, 197-199, 87 L. Ed. 2d 126, 105 S.
Ct. 3108 (1985).

Although Agins' reliance on due process precedents is understandable, the
language the Court selected was regrettably imprecise. The ""substantially
advances"" formula suggests a means-ends test: It asks, in essence, whether a
regulation of private property is effective in achieving some legitimate public
purpose. An inquiry of this nature has some logic in the context of a due
process challenge, for a regulation that fails to serve any legitimate
governmental objective may be so arbitrary or irrational that it runs afoul of
the Due Process Clause. See, e.g.,  County of  [**2084]  Sacramento v. Lewis,
523 U.S. 833, 846, 140 L. Ed. 2d 1043, 118 S. Ct. 1708 (1998) (stating that the
Due Process Clause is intended, in part, to protect the individual against ""the
exercise of power without any reasonable justification in the service of a
legitimate governmental objective""). But such a test is not a valid method of
discerning whether private property has been ""taken"" for purposes of the Fifth
Amendment.

In stark contrast to the three regulatory takings tests discussed above, the
""substantially advances"" inquiry reveals nothing about the magnitude or
character of the burden a particular regulation imposes upon private property
rights. Nor does it provide any information about how any regulatory burden is
distributed among property owners. In consequence, this test does not help to
identify those regulations whose effects are functionally comparable to
government appropriation or invasion of private property;  it is tethered
neither to the text of the Takings Clause nor to the basic justification for
allowing regulatory actions to be challenged under the Clause.

Chevron appeals to the general principle that the Takings Clause is meant ""'to
bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in
all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.'"" Brief
[*543]  for Respondent 17-21 (quoting  Armstrong,  [***891]  364 U.S., at 49, 4
L. Ed. 2d 1554, 80 S. Ct. 1563). But that appeal is clearly misplaced, for the
reasons just indicated. A test that tells us nothing about the actual burden
imposed on property rights, or how that burden is allocated, cannot tell us when
justice might require that the burden be spread among taxpayers through the
payment of compensation. The owner of a property subject to a regulation that
effectively serves a legitimate state interest may be just as singled out and
just as burdened as the owner of a property subject to an ineffective
regulation. It would make little sense to say that the second owner has suffered
a taking while the first has not. Likewise, an ineffective regulation may not
significantly burden property rights at all, and it may distribute any burden
broadly and evenly among property owners. The notion that such a regulation
nevertheless ""takes"" private property for public use merely by virtue of its
ineffectiveness or foolishness is untenable.

Instead of addressing a challenged regulation's effect on private property, the
""substantially advances"" inquiry probes the regulation's underlying validity.
But such an inquiry is logically prior to and distinct from the question whether
a regulation effects a taking, for the Takings Clause presupposes that the
government has acted in pursuit of a valid public purpose.  [HN4] The Clause
expressly requires compensation where government takes private property ""for
public use."" It does not bar government from interfering with property rights,
but rather requires compensation ""in the event of otherwise proper interference
amounting to a taking.""  First English Evangelical Lutheran Church, 482 U.S., at
315, 96 L. Ed. 2d 250, 107 S. Ct. 2378 (emphasis added). Conversely, if a
government action is found to be impermissible -- for instance because it fails
to meet the ""public use"" requirement or is so arbitrary as to violate due
process -- that is the end of the inquiry. No amount of compensation can
authorize such action.

Chevron's challenge to the Hawaii statute in this case illustrates the flaws in
the ""substantially advances"" theory. To  [*544]  begin with, it is unclear how
significantly Hawaii's rent cap actually burdens Chevron's property rights. The
parties stipulated below that the cap would reduce Chevron's aggregate rental
income on 11  [**2085]  of its 64 lessee-dealer stations by about $ 207,000 per
year, but that Chevron nevertheless expects to receive a return on its
investment in these stations that satisfies any constitutional standard. See
supra, at 534. Moreover, Chevron asserted below, and the District Court found,
that Chevron would recoup any reductions in its rental income by raising
wholesale gasoline prices. See supra, at 535. In short, Chevron has not clearly
argued -- let alone established -- that it has been singled out to bear any
particularly severe regulatory burden. Rather, the gravamen of Chevron's claim
is simply that Hawaii's rent cap will not actually serve the State's legitimate
interest in protecting consumers against high gasoline prices. Whatever the
merits of that claim, it does not sound under the Takings Clause. Chevron
plainly does not seek compensation for a taking of its property for a legitimate
public use, but rather an injunction against the enforcement of a regulation
[***892]  that it alleges to be fundamentally arbitrary and irrational.

Finally, the ""substantially advances"" formula is not only doctrinally untenable
as a takings test -- its application as such would also present serious
practical difficulties. The Agins formula can be read to demand heightened
means-ends review of virtually any regulation of private property. If so
interpreted, it would require courts to scrutinize the efficacy of a vast array
of state and federal regulations -- a task for which courts are not well suited.
Moreover, it would empower -- and might often require -- courts to substitute
their predictive judgments for those of elected legislatures and expert
agencies.

Although the instant case is only the tip of the proverbial iceberg, it
foreshadows the hazards of placing courts in this role. To resolve Chevron's
takings claim, the District Court was required to choose between the views of
two opposing  [*545]  economists as to whether Hawaii's rent control statute
would help to prevent concentration and supracompetitive prices in the State's
retail gasoline market. Finding one expert to be ""more persuasive"" than the
other, the court concluded that the Hawaii Legislature's chosen regulatory
strategy would not actually achieve its objectives. See  198 F. Supp. 2d, at
1187-1193. The court determined that there was no evidence that oil companies
had "

 [***LEdHR1A] [1A]  [***LEdHR2A] [2A] [**403]   [HN1] Federal Rule of Criminal
Procedure 33(a) allows a district court to ""vacate any judgment and grant a new
trial if the interest of justice so requires."" But ""[a]ny motion for a new trial
grounded on any reason other than newly discovered evidence must be filed within
7 days after the verdict or finding of guilty, or within such further time as
the court sets during the 7-day period."" Rule 33(b)(2).  This deadline is rigid.
[***17]  The Rules provide that courts ""may not extend the time to take any
action under [Rule 33], except as stated"" in Rule 33 itself.  Rule 45(b)(2).
The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has construed Rule 33's time
limitations as ""jurisdictional,"" permitting the Government to raise
noncompliance with those limitations for the first time on appeal.   388 F.3d
1043, 1049 (2004).  However, there is ""a critical difference between a rule
governing subject-matter jurisdiction and an inflexible claim-processing rule.""
Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S. 443, 456, 124 S. Ct. 906, 157 L. Ed. 2d 867 (2004).

[***LEdHR1A] [1B] Petitioner Ivan Eberhart was convicted of one count of
conspiring to distribute cocaine.  On the last day available for post-trial
motions, he moved for judgment of acquittal or, in the alternative, for a new
trial. That motion raised a single ground for relief--an alleged flaw in a
transcript that had been published to the jury.  Nearly six months later,
petitioner filed a ""supplemental memorandum"" supporting his motion.  Two
additional grounds appeared in that filing--admission of potential hearsay
testimony into evidence, and the District Court's failure to give a so-called
""buyer-seller instruction"" to the jury.   388 F.3d at 1047-1048.  Rather than
arguing,  however, that the untimeliness of the supplemental memorandum barred
the District Court from  [*14]  considering the issues it raised, the Government
opposed it on the merits.

The District Court granted the motion for a new trial, citing all three grounds
raised by petitioner.  The judge concluded that ""'none of these concerns
standing alone or in pairing would cause me to grant a new trial,'"" but that
taken together, they ""'persuade me that the interests of justice require a new
trial.'""  Id., at 1048.  The judge also predicted that ""'a new trial will quite
likely lead to another conviction.'"" Ibid.

On appeal, the Government pointed to the untimeliness of petitioner's
supplemental memorandum, and argued that the District Court had abused its
discretion in granting a new trial based on the arguments that the memorandum
had raised.  The Court of Appeals reversed the grant of a new trial, finding
that the District Court had lacked jurisdiction to grant one.  The Seventh
Circuit observed: ""The Supreme Court has held that Rule 45(b)'s prohibition on
extensions of time is 'mandatory and jurisdictional.'""  Id., at 1049 (quoting
United States v. Robinson, 361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S. Ct. 282, 4 L. Ed. 2d 259
(1960), and citing  United States v. Smith, 331 U.S. 469, 474, n. 2, 67 S. Ct.
1330, 91 L. Ed. 1610 (1947)).  Based on Robinson and Smith, the Seventh Circuit
explained, ""'[w]e have previously emphasized that [Rule 33's] 7-day period is
jurisdictional, and that the court is without jurisdiction to consider even an
amendment to a timely new trial motion if it is filed outside the seven day
period, absent a timely extension by the court or new evidence.'""  388 F.3d at
1049 (quoting  United States v. Washington, 184 F.3d 653, 659 (CA7 1999)).

The Court of Appeals did, however, express some misgiving.  After describing the
holding of Kontrick, it  [***18]  commented that ""[t]he reasoning of Kontrick
may suggest that Rule 33's time limits are merely inflexible claim-processing
rules that could be forfeited if not timely asserted.""  388 F.3d at 1049.  It
concluded, however, that even if Kontrick had undermined Robinson and Smith, ""we
are bound to follow  [*15]  them until expressly overruled by the Supreme
Court.""  388 F.3d at 1049 (citing  Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237, 117 S.
Ct. 1997, 138 L. Ed. 2d 391 (1997)).

II

[***LEdHR2A] [2B] In Kontrick, we determined that defenses made available by the
time limitations of Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure 4004 and 9006 may be
forfeited.  540 U.S., at 458-460, 124 S. Ct. 906, 157 L. Ed. 2d 867.  They are
not ""jurisdiction[al],"" but are instead ""claim-processing rules,"" that may be
""unalterable on a party's application"" but ""can nonetheless be forfeited if the
party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.""  Id., at 456, 124
S. Ct. 906, 157 L. Ed.2d 867.  In Kontrick, the [**405]  debtor responded on the
merits to a creditor's untimely objection to his discharge.  He did not raise
the untimeliness issue, and the court resolved the merits in favor of the
creditor.  On motion for reconsideration and on appeal, the debtor raised the
argument that Rules 4004 and 9006 ""have the same import as provisions governing
subject-matter jurisdiction.""  Id., at 455, 124 S. Ct. 906, 157 L. Ed. 2d 867.
We rejected this assertion and found that the debtor had forfeited the
timeliness argument.

The Rules we construed in Kontrick closely parallel those at issue here.  Like a
defendant wishing to move for a new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal
Procedure 33, a creditor wishing to object to a debtor's discharge in Chapter 7
liquidation proceedings has a set period of time to file with the court
(measured, in the latter context, from ""the first date set for the meeting of
creditors"").  Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4004(a).  If a creditor so moves, ""the
court may for cause extend the time to file a complaint objecting to discharge.""
Rule 4004(b).  And using language almost identical to Federal Rule of Criminal
Procedure 45(b)(2)'s admonition that ""[t]he court may not extend the time to
take any action under Rules 29, 33, 34, and 35, except as stated in those
rules,"" Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b)(3) states that ""[t]he court may enlarge the time
for taking action under Rules 1006(b)(2),  [*16]  1017(e), 3002(c), 4003(b),
4004(a), 4007(c), 8002, and 9033, only to the extent and under the conditions
stated in those rules.""

It is implausible that the Rules considered in Kontrick can be nonjurisdictional
claim-processing rules, while virtually identical provisions of the Rules of
Criminal Procedure can deprive federal courts of subject-matter jurisdiction.
Nothing in Rules 33 or 45 or our cases requires such a dissonance.  Moreover,
our most recent decisions have attempted to brush away confusion introduced by
our earlier opinions.  ""Clarity would be facilitated,"" we have said, ""if courts
and litigants used the label 'jurisdictional' not for claim-processing rules,
but only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject-matter
jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction) falling within a court's
adjudicatory authority.""  Kontrick, 540 U.S., at 455, 124 S. Ct. 906, 157 L. Ed.
2d 867.  We break no new ground in  [***19]  firmly classifying Rules 33 and 45
as claim-processing rules, despite the confusion generated by the ""less than
meticulous"" uses of the term ""jurisdictional"" in our earlier cases.   Id., at
454, 124 S. Ct. 906, 157 L. Ed. 2d 867.

The Seventh Circuit correctly identified our decisions in Smith and Robinson as
the source of the confusion.   388 F.3d at 1049.  Since we have not ""expressly
overruled"" them, it held, petitioner's appeal had to be dismissed.  Ibid. Those
cases, however, do not hold the limits of the Rules to be jurisdictional in the
proper sense that Kontrick describes.  See  540 U.S., at 455, 124 S. Ct. 906,
157 L. Ed. 2d 867.  We need not overrule Robinson or Smith to characterize Rules
33 and 45 as claim-processing rules.

In Smith, the District Judge rejected a Rule 33 motion for a new trial, and the
conviction was affirmed on appeal.   331 U.S., at 470, 67 S. Ct. 1330, 91 L. Ed.
1610. After the defendant was taken into custody, the District Judge changed his
mind.  Purporting to act under the authority of Rule 33, he issued an order
vacating his earlier judgment and granting a new trial.  Id., at 471, 67 S. Ct.
1330, 91 L. Ed. 1610.  Although we observed in a footnote that ""[t]he policy of
the Rules was not to extend power indefinitely but to confine  [*17]  it within
constant time periods,""  id., at 473-474, n. 2, 67 S. Ct. 1330, 91 L. Ed. 1610,
that observation hardly transforms the Rules into the keys to the kingdom of
subject-matter jurisdiction.  Rather, as we [**406]  emphasized in the text, the
District Judge could not use Rule 33 to sidestep a pre-existing basic principle
of judicial process--that once a final judgment is issued and the court of
appeals considers a case, a district court has no power to act on it further.
This was a consequence, however, not of the Rule, but of the Rule's failure to
alter prior law. Smith does not address the effect of untimely arguments in
support of a motion for new trial when, as here, the district court is still
considering post-trial motions and the case has not yet been appealed.

Nor does Robinson address that circumstance.  Defendants were 11 days late in
filing their notices of appeal under (what was then) Rule 37.  The Government
responded not by contesting the merits of the appeal, but by moving to dismiss
on the basis of untimeliness.  361 U.S., at 221, 80 S. Ct. 4 L. Ed. 2d 259.  The
Court of Appeals determined that if the District Court found that the untimely
notices of appeal sprang from ""excusable neglect,"" it could allow the appeals.
On remand, the District Court so found.   Id., at 222, 80 S. Ct. 282, 4 L. Ed.
2d 259.  We held that the Court of Appeals was wrong in having failed to dismiss
under Rule 45(b).   Id., at 229-230, 80 S. Ct. 282, 4 L. Ed. 2d 259.  Robinson
is correct not because the District Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction,
but because district courts must observe the clear limits of the Rules of
Criminal Procedure when they are properly invoked. This does not mean that
limits like those in Rule 33 are not forfeitable when they are not properly
invoked. Despite its narrow and unremarkable holding, Robinson has created some
confusion because of its observation that ""courts have uniformly held that the
taking of an appeal within the prescribed time is mandatory and jurisdictional.""
Id., at 229, 80 S. Ct. 282, 4 L. Ed. 2d 259 (emphasis added).  Indeed, we used
[***20]  the phrase ""mandatory and jurisdictional"" four times in the opinion.
And subsequent opinions have repeated this phrase,  [*18]  attributing it
directly or indirectly to Robinson. See, e.g.,  Hohn v. United States, 524 U.S.
236, 247, 118 S. Ct. 1969, 141 L. Ed. 2d 242 (1998);  Budinich v. Becton
Dickinson & Co., 486 U.S. 196, 203, 108 S. Ct. 1717, 100 L. Ed. 2d 178 (1988);
Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U.S. 56, 61, 103 S. Ct. 400, 74
L. Ed. 2d 225 (1982) (per curiam);  Browder v. Director, Dep't of Corrections,
434 U.S. 257, 264, 271-272, 98 S. Ct. 556, 54 L. Ed. 2d 521 (1978).  But see
Houston v. Lack, 487 U.S. 266, 269, 108 S. Ct. 2379, 101 L. Ed. 2d 245 (1988)
(reversing an order dismissing an appeal as jurisdictionally out of time when
""[n]either the District Court nor respondent suggested that the notice of appeal
might be untimely"");  Thompson v. INS, 375 U.S. 384, 386, 84 S. Ct. 397, 11 L.
Ed. 2d 404 (1964) (per curiam) (permitting appeal, when petitioner conceded that
post-trial motions were served late, in part because petitioner ""relied on the
Government's failure to raise a claim of untimeliness when the motions were
filed"").

As we recognized in Kontrick, courts ""have more than occasionally used the term
'jurisdictional' to describe emphatic time prescriptions in rules of court.""
540 U.S., at 454, 124 S. Ct. 906, 157 L. Ed. 2d 867.  See also ibid. (citing
Robinson as an example of when we have been ""less than meticulous"" in our use of
the word ""jurisdictional"").  The resulting imprecision has obscured the central
point of the Robinson case--that when the Government objected to a filing
untimely under Rule 37, the court's duty to dismiss the appeal was mandatory.
The net effect of Robinson, viewed through the clarifying lens of Kontrick, is
to admonish the Government that failure to object to untimely submissions
entails forfeiture of the objection, and to admonish defendants that timeliness
is of the essence, since the [**407]  Government is unlikely to miss timeliness
defects very often.

Our more recent cases have done much to clarify this point.  For instance, in
Carlisle v. United States, 517 U.S. 416, 116 S. Ct. 1460, 134 L. Ed. 2d 613
(1996), we held that a court may not grant a postverdict motion for a judgment
of acquittal that is untimely under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(c)
when the prosecutor objects. As we pointedly noted in Kontrick, our holding in
Carlisle did not ""characterize [Rule 29] as 'jurisdictional. '""  [*19]   540 U.
S., at 454-455, 124 S. Ct. 906, 157 L. Ed. 2d 867.  See also  Scarborough v.
Principi, 541 U.S. 401, 413-414, 124 S. Ct. 1856, 158 L. Ed. 2d 674 (2004)
(relying on Kontrick to hold that time limitations on applications for
attorney's fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C.  § 2412(d)(1),
did not implicate subject-matter jurisdiction).

[***LEdHR1A] [1C]  [***LEdHR2A] [2C] After Kontrick, it is difficult to escape
the conclusion that Rule 33 motions are similarly nonjurisdictional. By its
terms, Rule 45(b)(2) has precisely the same effect on extensions of time under
Rule 29 as it does under Rule 33, and as we noted in Kontrick, Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 45(b) and Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b) are both ""modeled on
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b).""  540 U.S., at 456, n. 10, 124 S. Ct. 906,
157 L. Ed. 2d 867.   [HN3] Rule 33, like Rule 29 and Bankruptcy Rule 4004, is a
claim-processing rule--one that  [***21]  is admittedly inflexible because of
Rule 45(b)'s insistent demand for a definite end to proceedings.  These
claim-processing rules thus assure relief to a party properly raising them, but
do not compel the same result if the party forfeits them.  Here, where the
Government failed to raise a defense of untimeliness until after the District
Court had reached the merits, it forfeited that defense.  The Court of Appeals
should therefore have proceeded to the merits.

We finally add a word about the approach taken by the Court of Appeals. Although
we find its disposition to have been in error, we fully appreciate that it is an
error shared among the circuits, and that it was caused in large part by
imprecision in our prior cases.  Our repetition of the phrase ""mandatory and
jurisdictional"" has understandably led the lower courts to err on the side of
caution by giving the limitations in Rules 33 and 45 the force of subject-matter
jurisdiction.  Convinced, therefore, that Robinson and Smith governed this case,
the Seventh Circuit felt bound to apply them, even though it expressed grave
doubts in light of Kontrick. This was a prudent course.  It neither forced the
issue by upsetting what the Court of Appeals took to be our settled precedents,
nor buried the issue by proceeding  [*20]  in a summary fashion.  By adhering to
its understanding of precedent, yet plainly expressing its doubts, it
facilitated our review.

The judgment of the Seventh Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

 [*322]  Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.

[**1564]   [***LEdHR1A] [1A] The Bankruptcy Code permits debtors to exempt
certain property from the bankruptcy estate, allowing them to retain those
assets rather than divide them among their creditors.  11 U.S.C. § 522 [11 USCS
§ 522]. The question in this case is whether debtors can exempt assets in their
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) from the bankruptcy estate pursuant to §
522(d)(10)(E).  We hold that IRAs can be so exempted.

I

Petitioners Richard and Betty Jo Rousey were formerly employed at Northrup
Grumman Corp.  At the termination of their employment, Northrup Grumman required
them to take lump-sum distributions from their employer-sponsored pension plans.
In re Rousey, 283 B. R. 265, 268 [***569]  (Bkrtcy. App. Panel CA8 2002); Brief
for Petitioners 2.  The Rouseys deposited the lump sums into two IRAs, one in
each of their names.   283 B. R., at 268.

The Rouseys' accounts qualify as IRAs under a number of requirements imposed by
the Internal [*323]  Revenue Code.  Each account is ""a trust created or
organized in the United States for the exclusive benefit of an individual or his
beneficiaries."" 26 U.S.C. § 408(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. II) [26 USCS § 408(a)].
The Internal Revenue Code limits the types of assets in which IRA-holders may
invest their accounts, §§ 408(a)(3), (a)(5), and provides that the balance in
IRAs is nonforfeitable, § 408(a)(4).  It also caps yearly contributions to IRAs.
§ 408(o)(2).  Withdrawals made before the accountholder turns 59 1/2 are, with
limited exceptions, subject to a 10-percent tax penalty.  § 72(t).

IRA contributions receive favorable tax treatment.  In particular, the Internal
Revenue Code generally defers taxation of the money placed in IRAs and the
income earned from those sums until the assets are withdrawn. See § 219(a)
(contributions to IRAs are tax deductible); § 408(e)(1) (IRA is tax exempt).
Moreover, within a certain timeframe accountholders can, as the Rouseys did
here, roll over distributions received from other retirement plans.  § 408(a)(1)
.  The Internal Revenue Code encourages such rollovers by making them
nontaxable.  §§ 408(d)(3), 402(c)(1), 403(b)(8), and 457(e)(16).

The Rouseys' IRA agreements, as well as relevant regulations, provide that their
""entire interest in the custodial account must be, or begin to be, distributed
by"" April 1 following the calendar yearend in which they reach age 70 1/2.   In
re Rousey, 275 B. R. 307, 310 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Ark. 2002).  The IRA agreements
permit withdrawal prior to age 59 1/2, but note the federal tax penalties
applicable to such distributions.   Id., at 311.

[**1565]  Several years after establishing their IRAs, the Rouseys filed a joint
Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
Western District of Arkansas.  In the schedules and statements accompanying
their petition, the Rouseys sought to shield portions of their IRAs from their
creditors by claiming them as exempt from the bankruptcy estate pursuant to 11
U.S.C. § 522(d)(10)(E) [11 USCS § 522(d)(10)(E)].   [HN1] This exemption
provides that a debtor may withdraw from the bankruptcy estate his ""right to
receive--


      [*324]  ""(E) a payment under a stock bonus, pension, profitsharing,
     annuity, or similar plan or contract on account of illness,
     disability, death, age, or length of service, to the extent reasonably
     necessary for the support of the debtor and any dependent of the
     debtor . . . .""



The Bankruptcy Court appointed respondent Jill R. Jacoway as the Chapter 7
Trustee.  As Trustee, Jacoway is responsible for overseeing the liquidation of
the bankruptcy estate and the distribution of the proceeds.  She objected to the
Rouseys' claim for the exemption of their IRAs and moved for turnover of those
sums to her.  The Bankruptcy Court sustained Jacoway's objection and granted her
motion.   275 B. R., at 309.

The Rouseys appealed.  The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (BAP) agreed  [***570]
with the Bankruptcy Court that the Rouseys could not exempt their IRAs under §
522(d)(10)(E).  It concluded that the IRAs were not ""'similar plan[s] or
contract[s]'"" to stock bonus, pension, profitsharing, or annuity plans, because,
by contrast to the limited access permitted in such plans, the Rouseys had
""unlimited access"" to the funds held in their IRAs.   283 B. R., at 272.  That
access also meant, the BAP reasoned, that the Rouseys had complete control over
the funds in their IRAs, ""subject only to a ten percent tax penalty.""  Id., at
273.  Because they had such control,  the payments from the IRAs were not ""on
account of any factor listed in 11 U.S.C. § 522(d)(10)(E) [11 USCS §
522(d)(10)(E)]."" Ibid.

The Rouseys again appealed, and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit
affirmed.  The Court of Appeals concluded that, even if the Rouseys' IRAs were
""'similar plans or contracts'"" to stock bonus, pension, profitsharing, or
annuity plans, their IRAs gave them no right to receive payment ""'on account of
age.'""  In re Rousey, 347 F.3d 689, 693 (2003).  Like the BAP, the Court of
Appeals reasoned that [*325]  the Rouseys' right to payment was conditioned
neither on age nor on any of the other statutory factors.  Their IRAs were
instead ""readily accessible savings accounts of which the debtors may easily
avail themselves (albeit with some discouraging tax consequences) at any time
for any purpose."" Ibid. The Court of Appeals recognized that several of its
sister Circuits had reached a contrary result.  Ibid. See  In re Brucher, 243
F.3d 242, 243-244 (CA6 2001);  In re McKown, 203 F.3d 1188, 1190 (CA9 2000);  In
re Dubroff, 119 F.3d 75, 78 (CA2 1997);  In re Carmichael, 100 F.3d 375, 378
(CA5 1996).

We granted certiorari to resolve this division among the Courts of Appeals
regarding whether debtors can exempt IRAs from the bankruptcy estate under 11
U.S.C. § 522(d)(10)(E) [11 USCS § 522(d)(10)(E)].   541 U.S. 1085, 159 L. Ed. 2d

[HN2]  [***LEdHR1A] [1B] As a general matter, upon the filing of a petition for
bankruptcy, ""all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property"" become
the property of the bankruptcy estate and will be distributed to the debtor's
creditors.  § 541(a)(1).  To help the debtor obtain a fresh start, the
Bankruptcy [**1566]  Code permits him to withdraw from the estate certain
interests in property, such as his car or home, up to certain values.  See, e.g.
, § 522(d);  United States v. Security Industrial Bank, 459 U.S. 70, 72, n. 1,
74 L. Ed. 2d 235, 103 S. Ct. 407 (1982).  In this case, the Rouseys claimed
their IRAs as exempt under § 522(d)(10)(E).   [HN3] Under the terms of the
statute, see  supra, at 323-324, 161 L. Ed. 2d at 569, 125 S. Ct. 1561, 544 U.S.
320, the Rouseys' right to receive payment under their IRAs must meet three
requirements to be exempted under this provision: (1) The right to receive
payment must be from ""a stock bonus, pension, profitsharing, annuity, or similar
plan or contract""; (2) the right to receive payment must be ""on account of
illness, disability, death, age, or length of service""; and (3) even then, the
right to receive payment may be exempted only  [*326]  ""to the extent"" that it
is ""reasonably necessary [to] support"" the accountholder or his dependents.  §
522(d)(10)(E).

The dispute in this case is whether  [***571]  the Rouseys' IRAs fulfill the
first and second requirements.  This Court implied that IRAs like the Rouseys'
satisfy both elements in  Patterson v. Shumate, 504 U.S. 753, 119 L. Ed. 2d 519,
112 S. Ct. 2242 (1992).  There, in construing another section of the Bankruptcy
Code, this Court stated that IRAs could be exempted pursuant to § 522(d)(10)(E).
Id., at 762-763, 119 L. Ed. 2d 519, 112 S. Ct. 2242  [HN4] (""Although a debtor's
interest [in an IRA] could not be excluded under § 541(c)(2) . . ., that
interest nevertheless could be exempted under § 522(d)(10)(E)"" (footnote
omitted)).  We now reaffirm that statement and conclude that IRAs can be
exempted from the bankruptcy estate pursuant to § 522(d)(10)(E).

A

[***LEdHR2A] [2A] We turn first to the requirement that the payment be ""on
account of illness, disability, death, age, or length of service."" Ibid.  [HN5]
We have interpreted the phrase ""on account of"" elsewhere within the Bankruptcy
Code to mean ""because of,"" thereby requiring a causal connection between the
term that the phrase ""on account of"" modifies and the factor specified in the
statute at issue.   Bank of America Nat. Trust and Sav. Assn. v. 203 North
LaSalle Street Partnership, 526 U.S. 434, 450-451, 143 L. Ed. 2d 607, 119 S. Ct.
1411 (1999).  In reaching that conclusion, we noted that ""because of"" was
""certainly the usage meant for the phrase at other places in the [bankruptcy]
statute,"" including the provision at issue here--§ 522(d)(10)(E).  Ibid. This
meaning comports with the common understanding of ""on account of."" See, e.g.,
Random House Dictionary of the English Language 13 (2d ed. 1987) (listing as
definitions ""by reason of,"" ""because of""); Webster's Third New International
Dictionary 13 (1981) (hereinafter Webster's 3d) (same).  The context of this
provision does not suggest that Congress deviated from the term's ordinary
meaning.  Thus, ""on account of"" in § 522(d)(10)(E) requires that the right to
receive  [*327]  payment be ""because of"" illness, disability, death, age, or
length of service.

Jacoway argues that the Rouseys' right to receive payment from their IRAs is not
""because of"" these listed factors.  In particular, she asserts that the Rouseys
can withdraw funds from their IRAs for any reason at all, so long as they are
willing to pay a 10-percent penalty. Thus, Jacoway maintains that there is no
causal connection between the Rouseys' right to payment and age (or any other
factor), because their IRAs provide a right to payment on demand.

[***LEdHR2A] [2B]  [***LEdHR3A] [3A] We disagree.  The statutes governing IRAs
persuade us that the Rouseys' right to payment from IRAs is causally connected
to their age.  Their right to receive payment of the entire balance is not in
[**1567]  dispute.  Because their accounts qualify as IRAs under 26 U.S.C. §
408(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. II) [26 USCS § 408(a)], the Rouseys have a
nonforfeitable right to the balance held in those accounts, § 408(a)(4).  That
right is restricted by a 10-percent tax penalty that applies to withdrawals from
IRAs made before the accountholder turns 59 1/2.  Contrary to Jacoway's
contention, this tax penalty is substantial.  The deterrent to early withdrawal
it creates suggests that Congress designed it to preclude early access to IRAs.
The low rates of early withdrawals are consistent with the notion that this
penalty substantially deters  [***572]  early withdrawals from such accounts. 1
[HN6] Because the 10-percent penalty applies proportionally  [*328]  to any
amounts withdrawn, it prevents access to the 10-percent that the Rouseys would
forfeit should they withdraw early, and thus it effectively prevents access to
the entire balance in their IRAs. 2 It therefore limits the Rouseys' right to
""payment"" of the balance of their IRAs.  And because this condition is removed
when the accountholder turns age 59 1/2, the Rouseys' right to the balance of
their IRAs is a right to payment ""on account of"" age. 3 The Rouseys no more have
an unrestricted right to payment of the balance in their IRAs than a contracting
party has an unrestricted right to breach a contract simply because the price of
doing so is the payment of damages. 4 Accordingly,  [*329]  we [**1568]
conclude that the Rouseys' IRAs provide a right to payment on account of age.

Evidence From a Panel of Taxpayers,  56 Nat. Tax J. 595, 602 (Sept. 2003) (Table

1988""); see also Sabelhaus, Projecting IRA Balances and Withdrawals, 20 Employee
Benefit Research Institute Notes 1, 3 (May 1999) (finding that ""[t]he pattern in

""has a big impact on withdrawal behavior"").

2 We need not and do not reach the question whether penalties of less than
10-percent or of a fixed amount would also be a sufficient barrier to early
withdrawal.

3  [***LEdHR3A] [3B] The Rouseys are entitled to penalty-free distributions
because of factors apart from age in certain circumstances.  See 26 U.S.C. §
72(t)(2)(A)(ii)-(iv) [26 USCS § 72(t)(2)(A)(ii)-(iv)] (permitting penalty-free
distributions due to the death of or disability of the IRA-holder, or as
substantially equal periodic payments for the life expectancy of the
accountholder); § 72(t)(2)(B) (medical expenses); §§ 72(t)(2)(D)-(F) (health
insurance premiums, certain higher education expenses, and first-time home
purchase).  But these circumstances are confined to specific and narrow uses.
See  infra, at 332-334, 161 L. Ed. 2d, at 575.  Thus, that there are other
circumstances in which the Rouseys can receive payment does not change our
conclusion that they have a right to payment on account of age, for these
exceptions do not undermine the fact that they cannot obtain unrestricted use of
their funds until age 59 1/2.  Moreover, § 522(d)(10)(E) requires that the right
to payment be on account of age--not that it be solely on account of this
factor.

Ct. 2159 (1995), upon which Jacoway relies, Brief for Respondent 17-19, are
consistent with our conclusion that petitioners' IRAs satisfy the statute's ""on
account of"" requirement.  Those cases involved the meaning of the phrase ""on
account of"" in a tax provision that permitted the exclusion from income of
damages received ""'on account' of personal injuries.""  O'Gilvie, supra, at 81,

132 L. Ed. 2d 294, 115 S. Ct. 2159.  In both cases, we rejected the claim that
damages that were punitive in nature were on account of personal injuries, since
such damages did not compensate for the personal injuries.  O'Gilvie, supra, at

[***LEdHR4A] [4A] In addition to requiring that the IRAs provide a right to
payment ""on account of"" age or one of the other factors listed in the statute,
11 U.S.C. § 522(d)(10)(E)[11 USCS  [***573]  § 522(d)(10)(E)] also requires the
Rouseys' IRAs to be ""stock bonus, pension, profitsharing, annuity, or similar
plan[s] or contract[s]."" No party contends that the Rouseys' IRAs are stock
bonus, pension, profitsharing, or annuity plans or contracts.  The issue, then,
is whether the Rouseys' IRAs are ""similar plan[s] or contract[s]"" within the
meaning of § 522(d)(10)(E).  To be ""similar,"" an IRA must be like, though not
identical to, the specific plans or contracts listed in § 522(d)(10)(E), and
consequently must share characteristics common to the listed plans or contracts.
See American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1206 (1981)
(hereinafter Am. Hert.); Webster's 3d 2120.

The Rouseys contend that IRAs are ""similar"" to stock bonus, pension,
profitsharing, or annuity plans or contracts, in that they have the same
""primary purpose,"" namely, ""enabl[ing] Americans to save for their retirement.""
Reply Brief for Petitioners 13.  Jacoway counters that IRAs are unlike the
listed plans because those plans provide ""deferred compensation,"" Brief for
Respondent 22, whereas IRAs allow complete access to deposited funds and are
therefore not deferred at all, id., at 22-24.  We agree with the Rouseys that
[HN7] IRAs are similar to the plans specified in the statute.  Those plans, like
the Rouseys' IRAs, provide a substitute for wages (by wages, for present
purposes, we mean compensation earned as hourly or salary income), and are not
mere savings accounts.  The Rouseys' IRAs are therefore  [*330]  ""similar
plan[s] or contract[s]"" within the meaning of § 522(d)(10)(E).

[***LEdHR4A] [4B]  [***LEdHR5] [5] We turn first to the characteristics the
specific plans and contracts listed in § 522(d)(10)(E) share.   [HN8] The
Bankruptcy Code does not define the terms ""profitsharing,"" ""stock bonus,""
""pension,"" or ""annuity."" Accordingly, we look to the ordinary meaning of these
terms.   United States v. LaBonte, 520 U.S. 751, 757, 137 L. Ed. 2d 1001, 117 S.
Ct. 1673 (1997);  Perrin v. United States, 444 U.S. 37, 42, 62 L. Ed. 2d 199,
100 S. Ct. 311 (1979).  A ""profitsharing"" plan, of course, is ""[a] system by
which employees receive a share of the profits of a business enterprise."" Am.
Hert. 1045. 5 Profitsharing plans may provide deferred compensation, but they
may also be ""cash plans"" in which a predetermined percentage of the profits is
distributed to employees at set intervals.  J. Langbein & B. Wolk, Pension and
Employee Benefit Law 48 (3d ed. 2000).  A stock bonus plan is like a
profitsharing plan, except that it distributes company stock rather than cash
from profits.  Id., at 49. 6 A pension is defined as ""a fixed sum . . . paid
under given conditions to a person following his retirement from service (as due
to age or disability) or to the surviving dependents of a person entitled
[**1569]  to such a pension."" Webster's 3d 1671. 7 Finally, an annuity is ""an
amount payable yearly or at other regular intervals . . .  [***574]  for a
certain or uncertain period (as for years, for life, or in perpetuity)."" Id., at
88. 8

system or process under which employees receive a part of the profits of an
industrial or commercial enterprise"").

 [*331]   [***LEdHR4A] [4C] The common feature of all of these plans is that
they provide income that substitutes for wages earned as salary or hourly
compensation.  This understanding of the plans' similarities comports with the
other types of payments that a debtor may exempt under § 522(d)(10) --all of
which concern income that substitutes for wages. See, e.g., § 522(d)(10)(A)
(""social security benefit, unemployment compensation, or a local public
assistance benefit""); § 522(d)(10)(B) (""a veterans' benefit""); § 522(d)(10)(C)
(""disability, illness, or unemployment benefit""); § 522(d)(10)(D)  (""alimony,
support, or separate maintenance"").  But the plans are dissimilar in other
respects: Employers establish and contribute to stock bonus, profitsharing, and
pension plans or contracts, whereas an individual can establish and contribute
to an annuity on terms and conditions he selects.  Moreover, pension plans and
annuities provide deferred payment, whereas profitsharing or stock bonus plans
may or may not provide deferred payment.  And while a pension provides
retirement income, none of these other plans necessarily provides retirement
income.  What all of these plans have in common is that they provide income that
substitutes for wages.

Several considerations convince us that the income the Rouseys will derive from
their IRAs is likewise income that substitutes for wages. First, the minimum
distribution requirements, as discussed above, require distribution to begin at
the latest in the calendar year after the year in which the accountholder turns
70 1/2.  Thus, accountholders must begin to withdraw funds when they are likely
to be retired and lack wage income.  Second, the Internal Revenue Code defers
taxation of money held in accounts qualifying as IRAs under 26 U.S.C. § 408(a)
(2000 ed. and Supp. II) [26 USCS § 408(a)]  until the year in which it is
distributed, treating it as income only in such years.  §§ 219, 408(e) (2000 ed.
and Supp. II).  This tax treatment further encourages accountholders to wait
until  [*332]  retirement to withdraw the funds: The later withdrawal occurs,
the longer the taxes on the amounts are deferred. Third, absent the
applicability of other exceptions discussed above, withdrawals before age 59 1/2
are subject to a tax penalty, restricting preretirement access to the funds.
Finally, to ensure that the beneficiary uses the IRA in his retirement years, an
accountholder's failure to take the requisite minimum distributions results in a
50-percent tax penalty on funds improperly remaining in the account.  § 4974(a).
All of these features show that IRA income substitutes for wages lost upon
retirement and distinguish IRAs from typical savings accounts.

We find unpersuasive Jacoway's contention that the IRAs cannot be similar plans
or contracts because the Rouseys have complete access to them.  At bottom, this
contention rests, as did her ""on account of""  [***575]  argument, on the premise
that the tax penalty imposed for early withdrawal is modest and hence not a true
limit on the withdrawal of funds.  As explained above,  [**1570]  however, that
penalty erects a substantial barrier to early withdrawal.  Supra, at 327-328,
161 L. Ed. 2d, at 571-572.  Funds in a typical savings account, by contrast, can
be withdrawn without age-based penalty.

We also reject Jacoway's argument that the availability of IRA withdrawals
exempt from the 10-percent penalty renders the Rouseys' IRAs more like savings
accounts.  While Jacoway is correct that the Internal Revenue Code permits
penalty-free early withdrawals in certain limited circumstances, 26 U.S.C. §
72(t)(2) [26 USCS § 72(t)(2)], these exceptions do not reduce the IRAs to
savings accounts.

The exceptions are narrow.  For example, penalty-free early distributions for
health insurance premiums are limited to unemployed individuals who have
received unemployment compensation for at least 12 consecutive weeks and have
taken those distributions during the same year in which the unemployment
compensation is made.  § 72(t)(2)(D).  These payments are further limited to the
actual amount paid for  [*333]  insurance for the accountholder, his spouse, and
his dependents.  § 72(t)(2)(D)(iii).  The Internal Revenue Code likewise caps
the amount of, and sets qualifications for, both the higher education expenses
and first-time home purchases for which penalty-free early distributions can be
taken.  §§ 72(t)(2)(E), 72(t)(7) (higher education expenses); §§ 72(t)(2)(F),
72(t)(8) (home purchases).  The Internal Revenue Code also permits penalty-free
distributions to a beneficiary on the death of the accountholder or in the event
that the accountholder becomes disabled.  §§ 72(t)(2)(A)(ii)-(iii). 9

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - Footnotes - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

9 The statute also permits penalty-free early withdrawal in the form of
substantially equal periodic payments made for the life expectancy of the
accountholder. 26 U.S.C. § 72(t)(2)(A)(iv) [26 USCS § 72(t)(2)].  This exception
is likewise limited.  If these payments are modified before the accountholder
turns 59 1/2 or within five years of the start of those payments, the
accountholder must pay not only the taxes that would have been imposed on those
previous payments, including the 10-percent penalty, but also interest for the
period in which the tax payment was deferred. § 72(q)(3).  As a result, if an
accountholder uses this exception, he must use only this form of early
withdrawal, lest he pay the penalty, taxes, and interest.  The statute permits
penalty-free withdrawals for medical expenses, which is likewise limited.  §
72(t)(2)(B).  The amount that can be withdrawn is capped by the amount that can
be deducted in a given year.  Ibid.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 These exceptions are limited in amount and scope.  Even with these carveouts,
an early withdrawal without penalty remains the exception, rather than the rule.
And as we explained in discussing the ""on account of"" requirement, withdrawals
from other retirement plans receive similar tax treatment.

Our conclusion that the Rouseys' IRAs can be exempt under 11 U.S.C. §
522(d)(10)(E) [11 USCS § 522(d)(10)(E)] finds support in clauses (i)-(iii) of §
522(d)(10)(E).  These clauses bring into the estate certain rights to payment
that otherwise would be exempt under § 522(d)(10)(E).  They provide that a right
to receive payment cannot be exempt if:


      [HN9] ""(i) such plan or contract was established by or under the
     auspices of an insider that employed the  [***576]  debtor at  [*334]

     ""(ii) such payment is on account of age or length of service; and

     ""(iii) such plan or contract does not qualify under section 401(a),
     403(a), 403(b) or 408 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.""



Thus, clauses (i)-(iii) preclude the debtor from using this exemption if an
insider established his plan or contract; the right to receive payment is on
account of age or length of service; and the plan does not qualify under the
specified Internal Revenue [**1571]  Code sections, including the section that
governs IRAs, 26 U.S.C. § 408 (2000 ed. and Supp. II) [26 USCS § 408].

As a general matter, it makes little sense to exclude from the exemption plans
that fail to qualify under § 408, unless all plans that do qualify under § 408,
including IRAs, are generally within the exemption. If IRAs were not within 11
U.S.C. § 522(d)(10)(E) [11 USCS § 522(d)(10)(E)], Congress would not have
referred to them in its exception.   McKown, 203 F.3d, at 1190.  More
specifically, clause (iii) suggests that plans qualifying under 26 U.S.C. § 408
(2000 ed. and Supp. II) [26 USCS § 408], including IRAs, are similar plans or
contracts.  The other sections of the Internal Revenue Code cited in clause
(iii) --§§ 401(a), 403(a), and 403(b) --all establish requirements for
tax-qualified retirement plans that take the form of, among other things,
annuities, profitsharing plans, and stock bonus plans.  By grouping § 408 with
these other plans that are of the specific types listed in subparagraph (E),
clause (iii) suggests that IRAs are similar to them.  Thus, the text of these
clauses not only suggests generally that the Rouseys' IRAs are exempt, but also
supports our conclusion that they are ""similar plan[s] or contract[s]"" under 11
U.S.C. § 522(d)(10)(E) [11 USCS § 522(d)(10)(E)].


     * * *



 [***LEdHR1A] [1C] In sum, the Rouseys' IRAs fulfill both of § 522(d)(10)(E)'s
requirements at issue here--they confer a right to receive  [*335]  payment on
account of age and they are similar plans or contracts to those enumerated in §
522(d)(10)(E).  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

 [*83]   [**610]  Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A] This case concerns  [HN1] 28 U.S.C. § 1441, which authorizes
the removal of civil actions from state court to federal court when the action
initiated in state court is one that could have been brought, originally, in a
federal district court.  § 1441(a).   [HN2] When federal-court jurisdiction is
predicated on the parties' diversity of citizenship, see § 1332, removal is
permissible ""only if none of the parties in interest properly  [*84]  joined and
served as defendants is a citizen of the State in which [the] action [was]
brought."" § 1441(b).

Christophe and Juanita Roche, plaintiffs below, respondents here, are citizens
of Virginia.  They commenced suit in state court against diverse defendants,
including Lincoln Property Company (Lincoln), a corporation chartered and having
its principal place of business in Texas.  The defendants removed the litigation
to a Federal District Court where, after discovery proceedings, they
successfully moved for summary judgment. Holding the removal improper, the Court
of Appeals instructed remand of the action to state court.   373 F.3d 610,
620-622 (CA4 2004).  The appellate court so ruled on the ground that the Texas
defendant failed to show the nonexistence of an affiliated Virginia entity that
was the ""real party in interest.""  Id., at 622.

[***LEdHR2A] [2A]  [***LEdHR3A] [3A] We reverse the judgment of the Court of
Appeals.   [HN3] Defendants may remove an action on the basis of diversity of
citizenship if there is complete diversity between all named plaintiffs and all
named defendants, and no defendant is a citizen of the forum State.  It is not
incumbent on the named defendants to negate the existence of a potential
defendant whose presence in the action would destroy diversity. 1

1  [***LEdHR3A] [3B] Defendants below, petitioners here, presented a second
question in their petition for certiorari: Can a limited partnership be deemed a
citizen of a State on the sole ground that the partnership's business activities
bear a ""very close nexus"" with the State?  Because no partnership is or need be
a party to this action, that question is not live for adjudication.  We note,
however, that our prior decisions do not regard as relevant to subject-matter
jurisdiction the locations at which partnerships conduct business.  See  Carden

Christophe and Juanita Roche  [***422]  leased an apartment in the Westfield
Village complex in Fairfax County, Virginia.   [*85]  About a year after moving
in, they discovered evidence of toxic mold in their apartment. Expert inspection
confirmed the presence of mold, which the inspection report linked to hair loss,
headaches, irritation of the respiratory tract, fatigue, and dermatitis.  App.
184-190.  The report stated that spores from toxigenic mold species were
airborne in the apartment and had likely contaminated the carpeting and fabric
surfaces throughout the dwelling.  Id., at 188.  The Roches moved out of their
apartment for the remediation process, leaving their personal belongings in the
care of Lincoln, the designated property manager of Westfield Village, and the
mold treatment firm.   373 F.3d, at 612.

Some months later, the Roches commenced suit, filing two substantially similar
complaints in the Circuit Court for Fairfax County, Virginia.  App. 27-50,
53-75.  Both complaints asserted serious [**611]  medical ailments from the
Roches' year-long exposure to toxic mold, and sought damages under multiple
headings, including negligence, breach of contract, actual fraud, constructive
fraud, and violations of Virginia housing regulations.  Id., at 38-48, 64-74.
In addition, the Roches alleged loss, theft, or destruction of their personal
property (including irreplaceable family keepsakes) during the remediation
process.  Regarding these losses, they sought damages for conversion and
infliction of emotional distress.  Id., at 49-50, 74-75.

In state court, the Roches' complaints named three defendants: Lincoln; INVESCO
Institutional, an investment management group; and State of Wisconsin Investment
Board, the alleged owner of Westfield Village.  Id., at 26-28, 52-54.  The
complaints described Lincoln as ""a developer and manager of residential
communities, including . . . Westfield Village."" Id., at 27, 53.  ""[A]cting by
and through [its] agents,"" the Roches alleged, Lincoln caused the personal
injuries of which they complained.  Id., at 30, 56.

Defendants timely removed the twin cases to the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Virginia,  [*86]  invoking that court's
diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction.  See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332(a)(1), 1441(a).
The notice of removal described Lincoln as a Texas corporation with its
principal place of business in Texas, INVESCO as a Delaware corporation with its
principal place of business in Georgia, and State of Wisconsin Investment Board
as an independent agency of Wisconsin.  App. 81.  In their consolidated
federal-court complaint, the Roches identified themselves as citizens of
Virginia and Lincoln as a corporation headquartered in Texas, just as they did
in their state-court complaints.  Id., at 27, 53, 114-115. 2 Further, they
stated affirmatively that the federal court ""has jurisdiction of this matter.""
Id., at 114.  Lincoln, in its answer to the complaint, admitted that, through
its  [***423]  regional offices, ""it manages Westfield Village."" Id., at 137,
138.  Lincoln did not seek to avoid liability by asserting that some other
entity was responsible for managing the property.

2 Some weeks after the removal, the District Court dismissed INVESCO as a
defendant.  App. 112.  Nothing turns on the presence or absence of INVESCO as a
defending party.  State of Wisconsin Investment Board, alleged owner of
Westfield Village, remains a defendant-petitioner.  Its status as a Wisconsin
citizen for diversity purposes is not currently contested.

 In both their state- and federal-court complaints, the Roches stated that,
""[u]pon further discovery in this case,"" they would ""determine if additional
defendant or defendants will be named."" Id., at 28, 54, 116.  Although they
engaged in some discovery concerning Lincoln's affiliates, their efforts in this
regard were not extensive, Tr. of Oral Arg. 9, 14, 38-39, 48-49, 53, and at no
point did they seek to join any additional defendant.

After discovery, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment. The District
Court granted defendants' motion and denied plaintiffs' motion, noting that it
would set forth its reasons in a forthcoming memorandum order.  App. to Pet. for
Cert. 20a-21a.  The promised memorandum order  [*87]  issued a few months later,
id., at 22a-40a, and the District Court entered final judgment for the
defendants the same day, id., at 41a.

Six days after the District Court granted defendants' motion for summary
judgment, but before final judgment was entered, the Roches moved to remand the
case to the state court, alleging for the first time the absence of federal
subject-matter [**612]  jurisdiction. 3 Specifically, the Roches alleged that
Lincoln ""is not a Texas Corporation,  but a Partnership with one of its partners
residing in the Commonwealth of Virginia."" App. 226. 4 The District Court denied
the remand motion, concluding that Lincoln is a Texas corporation and that
removal was proper because the requisite complete diversity existed between all
plaintiffs and all defendants.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 84a-93a.

3 The Roches state that they preferred to litigate in state court for two
principal reasons: Virginia does not permit summary judgment based on affidavits
or deposition testimony, and Virginia has not adopted the rule of  Daubert v.
Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d
469 (1993), to assess expert evidence.  Brief for Respondents 3, and n 1.

4 Confusion about Lincoln's structure is understandable.  Real estate businesses
typically operate through a web of affiliated entities, see Brief for Real
Estate Roundtable et al. as Amici Curiae 6-13, and certain Lincoln-affiliated
responders to the Roches' discovery inquiries stated that Lincoln was a
partnership, e.g., App. 175, 176, 179.  In response to the Roches' motion to
remand, Lincoln proffered its 1979 Texas incorporation papers and an affidavit
attesting to its status as a Texas corporation.  Id., at 238-246.  That matter
is no longer debated; at oral argument, counsel for the Roches acknowledged that
Lincoln is a Texas corporation.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 40-41.

 The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and instructed the
District Court to remand the case to the state court.   373 F.3d, at 622.
Although recognizing that Lincoln is a Texas citizen and a proper party to the
action,  id., at 620-621, the Court of Appeals observed that ""Lincoln operates
under many different structures,""  id., at 617.  Describing Lincoln as ""the
nominal party and ultimate parent company,"" the appellate court suspected that
an unidentified [*88]  ""Virginia subsidiary, be it a partnership, corporation or
otherwise, rather than the Texas parent"" was ""the real and substantial party in
interest.""  Id., at 620-621.  Lincoln, the party invoking federal-court
jurisdiction, had not demonstrated the nonexistence of ""the Virginia
sub-'partnership,'"" the Court  [***424]  of Appeals reasoned,  id., at 621, and
therefore had not met its burden of establishing diversity,  id., at 621-622.

We granted certiorari,  543 U.S. 1186, 543 U.S. 1186, 125 S. Ct. 1398, 161 L.
Ed. 2d 189 (2005), to resolve a division among the Circuits on the question
whether an entity not named or joined as a defendant can nonetheless be deemed a
real party in interest whose presence would destroy diversity. Compare  373
F.3d, at 620-622, with  Plains Growers, Inc. by Florists' Mut. Ins. Co. v.
Ickes-Braun Glasshouses, Inc., 474 F.2d 250, 252 (CA5 1973) (""The citizenship of
one who has an interest in the lawsuit but who has not been made a party . . .
by plaintiff cannot be used by plaintiff on a motion to remand to defeat
diversity jurisdiction.""), and  Simpson v. Alaska State Com. for Human Rights,
608 F.2d 1171, 1173-1175 (CA9 1979) (Kennedy, J.) (upholding removal where
Alaska plaintiff sued Rhode Island parent company without joining as well
potentially liable Alaska subsidiary, and the parties did not act collusively to
create diversity jurisdiction).

II

[***LEdHR1A] [1B] The Court of Appeals correctly identified Lincoln as a proper
party to the action, but it erred in insisting that some other entity affiliated
with Lincoln should have been joined as a codefendant, and that it was Lincoln's
obligation to name that entity and show that its joinder would not destroy
diversity.

[***LEdHR4A] [4A] We stress, first, that, at this stage of the case, the
existence of complete diversity between the Roches and Lincoln is [**613]  not
in doubt.  The Roches, both citizens of Virginia, acknowledge that Lincoln is
indeed a corporation, not a partnership, and that Lincoln is chartered in and
has its principal place of business in Texas.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 40-41; see App.
[*89]  114 (""Upon information and belief, Lincoln Property Company is a
corporation with corporate headquarters [in] Texas."");  373 F.3d, at 620.
Accordingly, for jurisdictional purposes, Lincoln is a citizen of Texas and of
no other State.  28 U.S.C. § 1332(c)(1)  [HN4] (""a corporation shall be deemed
to be a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated and of the State
where it has its principal place of business"").

We turn now to the reasons why the Fourth Circuit erred in determining that
diversity jurisdiction was not proved by the removing parties.   373 F.3d, at
612 (concluding that ""defendants failed to carry their burden of proof with
respect to their allegedly diverse citizenship"").   [HN5] The principal federal
statute governing diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332, gives federal
district courts original jurisdiction of all civil actions ""between . . .
citizens of different States"" where the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.
§ 1332(a)(1). 5 Since  Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 7 U.S. 267, 3 Cranch 267, 2 L.
Ed. 435 (1806), we have read the statutory formulation ""between . . . citizens
of different States"" to require complete diversity between all plaintiffs and
all defendants.  Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U.S. 61, 68, 117 S. Ct. 467, 136
L. Ed. 2d 437 (1996); cf.  State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Tashire, 386 U.S.
523, 530-531, 87 S. Ct. 1199, 18 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1967)  [***425]  (explaining
that complete diversity is not constitutionally required and upholding
interpleader under § 1335 based on minimal diversity, i.e., diversity between
two or more adverse parties).

While § 1332 allows plaintiffs to invoke the federal courts' diversity
jurisdiction, § 1441 gives defendants a corresponding opportunity.  Section
1441(a) states:  [HN6] ""Except as otherwise expressly provided by Act of
Congress, any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts
of the United States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant
or the defendants, to the district court of the United States for the district
and division embracing the place where such action is pending."" The scales are
not  [*90]  evenly balanced, however.   [HN7] An in-state plaintiff may invoke
diversity jurisdiction, but § 1441(b) bars removal on the basis of diversity if
any ""part[y] in interest properly joined and served as [a] defendan[t] is a
citizen of the State in which [the] action is brought."" 6 In the instant case,
Virginia plaintiffs Christophe and Juanita Roche joined and served no Virginian
as a party defendant.  Hence the action qualified for the removal defendants
effected.

6 Although we have not addressed the issue, several lower courts have held that
the presence of a diverse but in-state defendant in a removed action is a
""procedural"" defect, not a ""jurisdictional"" bar, and that the defect is waived
if not timely raised by the plaintiff.  See 14C C. Wright, A. Miller, & E.
Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3739, pp 451-457, and nn 32-37 (3d ed.
1998).

  [***LEdHR1A] [1C] Neither Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(a), captioned
""Real Party in Interest,"" nor Rule 19, captioned ""Joinder of Persons Needed for
Just Adjudication,"" requires plaintiffs or defendants to name and join any
additional parties to this action.  Both Rules, we note, address party joinder,
not federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction.  See Rule 82  [HN8] (""[The
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure] shall notbe construed  [**614]  to extend or
limit the jurisdiction of the United States district courts . . . .""); Advisory
Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19, 28 U.S.C. App., pp 696-698.  Rule
17(a) directs that  [HN9] ""[e]very action shall be prosecuted in the name of the
real party in interest."" (Emphasis added.) That Rule, as its text displays,
speaks to joinder of plaintiffs, not defendants.

[HN10] Rule 19 provides for the joinder of parties who should or must take part
in the litigation to achieve a ""[j]ust [a]djudication."" See  Provident
Tradesmens Bank & Trust Co. v. Patterson, 390 U.S. 102, 118-123, 88 S. Ct. 733,
19 L. Ed. 2d 936 (1968).  The Roches place no reliance on Rule 19 and maintain
that the Rule ""played no part, explicitly or implicitly, in the Court of
Appeals' conclusion.  "" Brief for Respondents 36.  Given Lincoln's admission
that it managed Westfield Village when mold contaminated  [*91]  the Roches'
apartment, see supra, at 546 U.S. 81, 86, 126 S. Ct. 606, 163 L. Ed. 2d, at 423,
424, it does indeed appear that no absent person, formally or practically, was
""[n]eeded for [j]ust [a]djudication."" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19; cf.  Simpson, 608
F.2d, at 1174 (diverse corporate defendant accepted full liability for any
eventual adverse judgment; nondiverse subsidiary need not be joined as a
defendant, although arguably it had joint liability with its parent); 16 J.
Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice § 107.14[2][c], p 107-67 (3d ed.
2005)(hereinafter Moore)  [HN11] (""In general, the plaintiff is the  [***426]
master of the complaint and has the option of naming only those parties the
plaintiff chooses to sue, subject only to the rules of joinder [of] necessary
parties."").

[***LEdHR2A] [2B] While Rule 17(a) applies only to joinder of parties who assert
claims, the Court of Appeals and the Roches draw from decisions of this Court a
jurisdictional ""real parties to the controversy"" rule applicable in diversity
cases to complaining and defending parties alike.  See  Navarro Sav. Ass'n v.
Lee, 446 U.S. 458, 462, n. 9, 100 S. Ct. 1779, 64 L. Ed. 2d 425 (1980) (citing
Note,  Diversity Jurisdiction over Unincorporated Business Entities: The Real
Party in Interest as a Jurisdictional Rule, 56 Texas L. Rev. 243, 247-250
(1978)). But no decision called to our attention supports the burden the Court
of Appeals placed on a properly joined defendant to negate the existence of a
potential codefendant whose presence in the action would destroy diversity.

III

[***LEdHR1A] [1D] Our decisions employing ""real party to the controversy""
terminology in describing or explaining who counts and who can be discounted for
diversity purposes bear scant resemblance to the action the Roches have
commenced.  No party here has been ""improperly or collusively"" named solely to
create federal jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. § 1359  [HN12] (""A district court
shall not have jurisdiction of a civil action in which any party, by assignment
or otherwise, has been improperly or collusively made or joined to invoke the
jurisdiction of such court."");  Kramer v. Caribbean Mills, Inc., 394 U.S. 823,
830, 89 S. Ct. 1487, 23 L. Ed. 2d 9  [*92]  (1969)  [*92]  (assignment for
collection only, motivated by desire to make diversity jurisdiction available,
falls within the ""very core"" of § 1359);  Little v. Giles, 118 U.S. 596,
600-607, 7 S. Ct. 32, 30 L. Ed. 269 (1886) (where land was purportedly sold to
out-of-state farmer but no money or deed changed hands, quiet title action could
not be maintained based on farmer's diverse citizenship), nor to defeat it, see
Chesapeake & O. R. Co. v. Cockrell, 232 U.S. 146, 152, 34 S. Ct. 278, 58 L. Ed.
544 (1914) (diverse defendants, upon showing that joinder of nondiverse party
was ""without right and made in bad faith,"" may  [**615]  successfully remove the
action to federal court).

Nor are the Roches aided by cases in which actions against a state agency have
been regarded as suits against the State itself.  See, e.g.,  State Highway
Comm'n of Wyo. v. Utah Constr. Co., 278 U.S. 194, 199-200, 49 S. Ct. 104, 73 L.
Ed. 262 (1929) (""[State] Commission was but the arm or alter ego of the State
with no funds or ability to respond in damages."").  Decisions of this genre are
bottomed on this Court's recognition of a State's asserted Eleventh Amendment
right not to be haled into federal court.  See, e.g.,  FMC v. S.C. State Ports
Auth., 535 U.S. 743, 769, 122 S. Ct. 1864, 152 L. Ed. 2d 962 (2002). 7 They are
not pertinent to suits between private parties.

7 Similarly inapposite are cases invoking our original jurisdiction in which we
have inquired into the capacity in which a sovereign party appears.  See, e.g.,
Oklahoma ex rel. Johnson v. Cook, 304 U.S. 387, 395-396, 58 S. Ct. 954, 82 L.

trustee for its citizens);  United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. United
States ex rel. Kenyon, 204 U.S. 349, 358, 27 S. Ct. 381, 51 L. Ed. 516 (1907)

nominal plaintiff"").

of, impact on, or stake in the controversy, e.g.,  Wood v. Davis, 59 U.S. 467,
18 How. 467, 469-470, 15 L. Ed. 460 (1856), Lincoln has a vital interest  [*93]
in this case. 8 Indeed, Lincoln accepted responsibility, in the event that the
Roches prevailed on the merits of their claims, by admitting that, ""[since
1996,] it has managed Westfield Village Apartments."" App. 137.  A named
defendant who admits involvement in the controversy and would be liable to pay a
resulting judgment is not ""nominal"" in any sense except that it is named in the
complaint.  Cf.  Knapp v. Railroad Co., 87 U.S. 117, 20 Wall. 117, 122, 22 L.
Ed. 328 (1874).

8  [***LEdHR5A] [5B] The Roches' complaints cast Lincoln as the primary
tortfeasor, alleging that Lincoln engaged in ""a conscious and predetermined
plan"" to conceal the hazards of mold from apartment residents.  App. 34, 60.
Further, the Roches alleged that Lincoln ignored numerous mold-related
maintenance requests they ""personally"" made to Lincoln, id., at 29, 55,
inquiries that, if followed up, might have prevented or lessened their injuries.

  [***LEdHR1A] [1F] In any event, we emphasize, the Fourth Circuit had no
warrant in this case to inquire whether some other person might have been joined
as an additional or substitute defendant.  See  ibid. at 122, 22 L. Ed. 328
(federal courts should not ""inquir[e] outside of the case in order to ascertain
whether some other person may not have an equitable interest in the cause of
action"");  Little, 118 U.S., at 603, 7 S. Ct. 32, 30 L. Ed. 269  [HN13] (if
named party's interest is real, the fact that other interested parties are not
joined ""will not affect the jurisdiction of the [federal courts]""); 16 Moore, §
107.14[2][c], p 107-67 (""Ordinarily, a court will not interfere with the
consequences of a plaintiff's selection in naming parties, unless the plaintiff
has impermissibly manufactured diversity or used an unacceptable device to
defeat diversity."").

Congress, empowered to prescribe the jurisdiction of the federal courts,
sometimes has specified that a named party's own citizenship does not determine
its diverse status.  Thus, as a procedural matter, executors, administrators,
and guardians ""may sue in [their] own name[s] without joining the party for
[**616]  whose benefit the action is brought."" Rule 17(a).  As to diversity
jurisdiction, however, § 1332(c)(2) directs that ""the legal representative of [a
decedent's]  [*94]  estate . . . shall be deemed to be a citizen only of the
same State as the decedent, and the legal representative of an infant or
incompetent shall be deemed to be a citizen only of the same State as the infant
or incompetent."" Congress has also provided that in direct action suits against
insurers to which the insured is not made a party, the ""insurer shall be deemed
a citizen of the State of which the insured is a citizen, as well as of any
State by which the insurer has been incorporated and of the State where it has
its principal place of business."" § 1332(c)(1).

[***LEdHR1A] [1G]  [***LEdHR4A] [4B]  [***LEdHR6] [6] But Congress surely has
not directed that a corporation, for diversity-of-citizenship purposes, shall be
deemed to have acquired the  [***428]  citizenship of all or any of its
affiliates.  For cases of the kind the Roches have instituted, Congress has
provided simply and only this instruction: ""[A] corporation shall be deemed to
be a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated and of the State
where it has its principal place of business."" Ibid. The jurisdictional rule
governing here is unambiguous and it is not amenable to judicial enlargement.
Under § 1332(c)(1), Lincoln is a citizen of Texas alone, and under § 1441(a) and
(b), this case was properly removed.


     * * *



 [***LEdHR1A] [1H] The Roches sued the entity they thought responsible for
managing their apartment. Lincoln affirmed that it was so responsible.  Complete
diversity existed.  The potential liability of other parties was a matter
plaintiffs' counsel might have assiduously explored through discovery devices.
It was not incumbent on Lincoln to propose as additional defendants persons the
Roches, as masters of their complaint, permissively might have joined.

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for
the Fourth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

 [*484]  [**1121]   Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A]  [***LEdHR2A] [2A] The question in this case is whether a
dredge is a ""vessel"" under §2(3)(G) of the Longshore and Harbor Workers'
Compensation Act (LHWCA), 44 Stat (pt. 2) 1425, as added by §2(a) of Pub. L.
98-426, 33 U.S.C. § 902(3)(G)[33 USCS § 902(3)(G)].  We hold that it is.

I

As part of Boston's Central Artery/Tunnel Project, or ""Big Dig,"" the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts undertook to extend the Massachusetts Turnpike
through a tunnel running beneath South Boston and Boston Harbor to Logan
Airport.  The Commonwealth employed respondent Dutra Construction Company to
assist in that undertaking.  At the time, Dutra owned the world's largest
dredge, the Super Scoop, which was capable of digging the 50-foot-deep,
100-foot-wide, three-quarter-mile-long trench beneath Boston Harbor that is now
the Ted Williams Tunnel.

The Super Scoop is a massive floating platform from which a clamshell bucket is
suspended beneath the water. The bucket removes silt from the ocean floor and
dumps the sediment onto one of two scows that float alongside the dredge. The
Super Scoop has certain characteristics common to seagoing vessels, such as a
captain and crew, navigational lights, ballast tanks, and a crew dining area.
But it lacks others.  Most conspicuously, the Super Scoop has only limited means
of self-propulsion.  It is moved long distances by tugboat.  (To work on the Big
Dig, it was towed from its home base in California through the Panama Canal and
up the eastern seaboard to Boston Harbor.) It navigates short distances by
manipulating its anchors and cables.  When dredging the  [*485]  Boston Harbor
trench, it typically moved in this [**1122]  way once every couple of hours,
[***940]  covering a distance of 30-to-50 feet each time.

Dutra hired petitioner Willard Stewart, a marine engineer, to maintain the
mechanical systems on the Super Scoop during its dredging of the harbor.  At the
time of Stewart's accident, the Super Scoop lay idle because one of its scows,
Scow No. 4, had suffered an engine malfunction and the other was at sea.
Stewart was on board Scow No. 4, feeding wires through an open hatch located
about 10 feet above the engine area.  While Stewart was perched beside the
hatch, the Super Scoop used its bucket to move the scow. In the process, the
scow collided with the Super Scoop, causing a jolt that plunged Stewart
headfirst through the hatch to the deck below.  He was seriously injured.

Stewart sued Dutra in the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts under the Jones Act, 38 Stat 1185, as amended, 41 Stat. 1007 and
96 Stat. 1955,, 46 U.S.C. App. § 688(a)[46 USCS Appx § 688(a)], alleging that he
was a seaman injured by Dutra's negligence.  He also filed an alternative claim
under § 5(b) of the LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. § 905(b)[33 USCS § 905(b)], which
authorizes covered employees to sue a ""vessel"" owner as a third party for an
injury caused by the owner's negligence.

Dutra moved for summary judgment on the Jones Act claim, arguing that Stewart
was not a seaman. The company acknowledged that Stewart was ""a member of the
[Super Scoop's] crew,""  230 F.3d 461, 466 (CA1 2000); that he spent
""[n]inety-nine percent of his time while on the job""  aboard the Super Scoop,
App. 20 (Defendant's Memorandum in Support of Summary Judgment); and that his
""duties contributed to the function"" of the Super Scoop, id., at 32.  Dutra
argued only that the Super Scoop was not a vessel for purposes of the Jones Act.
Dutra pointed to the Court of Appeals' en banc decision in  DiGiovanni v.
Traylor Brothers, Inc., 959 F.2d 1119 (CA1 1992), which held that ""if a  [*486]
barge . . . or other float's purpose or primary business is not navigation or
commerce, then workers assigned thereto for its shore enterprise are to be
considered seamen only when it is in actual navigation or transit"" at the time
of the plaintiff's injury.   Id., at 1123 (internal quotation marks omitted).
The District Court granted summary judgment to Dutra, because the Super Scoop's
primary purpose was dredging rather than transportation and because it was
stationary at the time of Stewart's injury.

On interlocutory appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that it too
was bound by  DiGiovanni. 230 F.3d, at 467-468.  The court reasoned that the
Super Scoop's primary function was construction and that ""[a]ny navigation or
transportation that may be required is incidental to this primary function.""
Id., at 468.  The court also concluded that the scow's movement at the time of
the accident did not help Stewart, because his status as a seaman depended on
the movement of the Super Scoop (which was stationary) rather than the scow.
Id., at 469.

On remand, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Dutra on
Stewart's alternative claim that Dutra was liable for negligence as an owner of
a ""vessel"" under the LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. § 905(b)[33 USCS § 905(b)].  The Court of
Appeals again affirmed.  It noted that Dutra had conceded that the Super Scoop
was a ""vessel"" for purposes  [***941]  of § 905(b), explaining that ""the LHWCA's
definition of 'vessel' is 'significantly more inclusive than that used for
evaluating seaman status under the Jones Act.'""  343 F.3d 10, 13 (CA1 2003)
(quoting  Morehead v. Atkinson-Kiewit, J/V, 97 F.3d 603, 607 (CA1 1996) (en
banc)).  The Court of Appeals nonetheless agreed with the District Court's
conclusion that Dutra's [**1123]  alleged negligence was committed in its
capacity as an employer rather than as owner of the vessel under § 905(b).

We granted certiorari to resolve confusion over how to determine whether a
watercraft is a ""vessel"" for purposes of the LHWCA. 540 U.S. 1177, 158 L. Ed. 2d
76, 124 S. Ct. 1414 (2004).

[*487]  II

Prior to the passage of the Jones Act, general maritime law usually entitled a
seaman who fell sick or was injured both to maintenance and cure (or the right
to be cared for and paid wages during the voyage, see, e.g.,  Harden v. Gordon,
11 F. Cas. 480, 482-483, F. Cas. No. 6047 (No. 6,047) (CC Me 1823) (Story, J.)),
and to damages for any ""injuries received . . . in consequence of the
unseaworthiness of the ship,""  The Osceola, 189 U.S. 158, 175, 47 L. Ed. 760, 23
S. Ct. 483 (1903).  Suits against shipowners for negligence, however, were
barred.  Courts presumed that the seaman, in signing articles of employment for
the voyage, had assumed the risks of his occupation; thus a seaman was ""not
allowed to recover an indemnity for the negligence of the master, or any member
of the crew."" Ibid.

Congress enacted the Jones Act in 1920 to remove this bar to negligence suits by
seamen. See  Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U.S. 347, 354, 132 L. Ed. 2d 314, 115
S. Ct. 2172 (1995).  Specifically, the Jones Act provides:


     ""Any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his
     employment may, at his election, maintain an action for damages at
     law, with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes
     of the United States modifying or extending the common-law right or
     remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply.""
     46 U.S.C. App. § 688(a)[46 USCS Appx § 688(a)].



Although the statute is silent on who is a ""seaman,"" both the maritime law
backdrop against which Congress enacted the Jones Act and Congress' subsequent
enactments provide some guidance.

First, ""seaman"" is a term of art that had an established meaning under general
maritime law. We have thus presumed that when the Jones Act made available
negligence remedies to ""[a]ny seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the
course of his employment,"" Congress took the term ""seaman"" as the general
maritime law found it.   Chandris,  [*488]  supra, at 355, 132 L. Ed. 2d 314,
115 S. Ct. 2172 (citing  Warner v. Goltra, 293 U.S. 155, 159, 79 L. Ed. 254, 55
S. Ct. 46 (1934)); G. Gilmore & C. Black, Law of Admiralty § 6-21, pp 328-329
(2d ed. 1975).

[***LEdHR3] [3] Second, Congress provided further guidance in 1927 when it
enacted the LHWCA, which provides scheduled compensation to land-based maritime
workers but which also excepts from its coverage ""a master or member of a crew
of any vessel."" 33 U.S.C. § 902(3)(G)[33 USCS § 902(3)(G)].  This exception is
simply ""a refinement of the term 'seaman' in the Jones Act.""  McDermott [***942]
Int'l, Inc. v. Wilander, 498 U.S. 337, 347, 112 L. Ed. 2d 866, 111 S. Ct. 807
(1991).  Thus, the Jones Act and the LHWCA are complementary regimes that work
in tandem: The Jones Act provides tort remedies to sea-based maritime workers,
while the LHWCA provides workers' compensation to land-based maritime employees.
Ibid.;  Swanson v. Marra Brothers, Inc., 328 U.S. 1, 6-7, 90 L. Ed. 1045, 66 S.
Ct. 869 (1946).

[***LEdHR4A] [4A] Still, discerning the contours of ""seaman"" status, even with
the general maritime law and the LHWCA's language as aids to interpretation, has
not been easy.  See  Chandris, supra, at 356, 132 L. Ed. 2d 314, 115 S. Ct. 2172
.  We began clarifying the definition of ""seaman"" in a pair of cases,  McDermott
[**1124]  Int'l, Inc. v Wilander, supra, and  Chandris, supra, that addressed
the relationship a worker must have to a vessel in order to be a ""master or
member"" of its crew. We now turn to the other half of the LHWCA's equation:  how
to determine whether a watercraft is a ""vessel.""

A

[***LEdHR1A] [1B]  [***LEdHR4A] [4B]  [***LEdHR5A] [5A] Just as Congress did not
define the term ""seaman"" in the Jones Act, 1 it did not define the term ""vessel""
in the LHWCA itself. 2  [*489]  However, Congress provided a definition
elsewhere.  At the time of the LHWCA's enactment, §§ 1 and 3 of the Revised
Statutes of 1873 specified:

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - Footnotes - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

1  [***LEdHR4A] [4C] The Shipping Act, of, 1916 defines the term ""vessel"" for
purposes of the Jones Act. See 46 U.S.C. App. § 801[46 USCS Appx § 801].
However, the provision of the Jones Act at issue here, § 688(a), speaks not of
""vessels,"" but of ""seamen."" In any event, because we have identified a Jones Act
""seaman"" with reference to the LHWCA's exclusion, see 33 U.S.C. § 902(3)(G)[33
USCS § 902(3)(G)] (""a master or member of a crew of any vessel""), it is the
LHWCA's use of the term ""vessel"" that matters.  And, as we explain, the context
surrounding Congress' enactment of the LHWCA suggests that Rev Stat § 3, now 1
U.S.C. § 3[1 USCS § 3], provides the controlling definition of the term ""vessel""
in the LHWCA.

2 As part of its 1972 Amendments to the LHWCA, Congress amended the Act with
what appears at first blush to be a definition of the term ""vessel"": ""Unless the
context requires otherwise, the term 'vessel' means any vessel upon which or in
connection with which any person entitled to benefits under this chapter suffers
injury or death arising out of or in the course of his employment, and said
vessel's owner, owner pro hac vice, agent, operator, charter or bare boat
charterer, master, officer, or crew member."" 33 U.S.C. § 902(21)[33 USCS §
902(21)].  However, Congress enacted this definition in conjunction with the
third-party vessel owner provision of § 905(b).  Rather than specifying the
characteristics of a vessel, § 902(21) instead lists the parties liable for the
negligent operation of a vessel. See  McCarthy v. The Bark Peking, 716 F.2d 130,
133 (CA2 1983) (§ 902(21) is ""circular"" and ""does not provide precise guidance
as to what is included within the term 'vessel'"").
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -




     ""In determining the meaning of the revised statutes, or of any act or
     resolution of Congress passed subsequent to February twenty-fifth,
     eighteen hundred and seventy-one, . . . [t]he word 'vessel' includes
     every description of water-craft or other artificial contrivance used,
     or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water."" 3 18
     Stat., pt. 1, p. 1.

3 Congress had used substantially the same definition before, first in an 1866
antismuggling statute, see § 1, 14 Stat. 178, and then in an 1870 statute
""provid[ing] for the Relief of sick and disabled Seamen,"" ch. CLXIX, 16 Stat.
169 (italics deleted); see id., § 7, 16 Stat. 170.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Sections 1 and 3 show that, because the LHWCA is an Act of Congress passed after
February 25, 1871,  [HN1] the LHWCA's use of the term ""vessel"" ""includes every
description of water-craft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of
being used, as a  [***943]  means of transportation on water."" Ibid.

[***LEdHR5A] [5B] Section 3's definition, repealed and recodified in 1947 as
part of the Rules of Construction Act, 1 U.S.C. § 3[1 USCS § 3],  has  [*490]
remained virtually unchanged from 1873 to the present. 4 Even now, § 3 continues
to supply the default definition of ""vessel"" throughout the U. S. Code, ""unless
the context indicates otherwise."" 1 U.S.C. § 1[1 USCS § 1]. The context
surrounding the LHWCA's enactment indicates that  [HN2] § 3 defines the term
""vessel"" for purposes of the LHWCA.

""watercraft."" § 3, 61 Stat 633.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Section 3 merely codified the meaning that the term ""vessel"" had acquired in
general maritime law. See 1 S. Friedell,  [**1125]  Benedict on Admiralty § 165
(rev. 7th ed. 2004).  In the decades following its enactment, § 3 was regularly
used to define the term ""vessel"" in maritime jurisprudence.  Taking only the
issue presented here--whether a dredge is a vessel--prior to passage of the
Jones Act and the LHWCA, courts often used § 3's definition to conclude that
dredges were vessels. 5

5 See, e.g.,  The Alabama, 19 F. 544, 546 (SD Ala. 1884) (dredge was a vessel
and subject to maritime liens);  Huismann v. The Pioneer, 30 F. 206, 207 (EDNY
1886) (dredge was a vessel under § 3);  Saylor v. Taylor, 77 F. 476, 477 (CA4
1896) (dredge was a vessel under § 3, and its workers were seamen);  The
International, 89 F. 484, 484-485 (CA3 1898) (dredge was a vessel under § 3);
Eastern S. S. Corp. v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 256 F. 497, 500-501 (CA1
1919) (type of dredge called a ""drillboat"" was a vessel under § 3);  Los Angeles
v. United Dredging Co., 14 F.2d 364, 365-366 (CA9 1926) (dredge was a vessel
under § 3 and its engineers were seamen).

 From the very beginning, these courts understood the differences between
dredges and more traditional seagoing vessels. Though smaller, the dredges at
issue in the earliest cases were essentially the same as the Super Scoop here.
For instance, the court could have been speaking equally of the Super Scoop as
of The Alabama when it declared:


     ""The dredge and scows have no means of propulsion of their own except
     that the dredge, by the use of anchors, windlass, and rope, is moved
     for short distances, as required in carrying on the business of
     dredging. Both  [*491]  the dredge and the scows are moved from place
     to place where they may be employed by being towed, and some of the
     tows have been for long distances and upon the high seas.  The dredge
     and scows are not made for or adapted to the carriage of freight or
     passengers, and the evidence does not show that, in point of fact,
     this dredge and scows had ever been so used and employed.""  The
     Alabama, 19 F. 544, 545 (SD Ala. 1884).



See also  Huismann v. The Pioneer, 30 F. 206 (EDNY 1886).  None of this
prevented the court from recognizing that dredges are vessels because they are
watercraft with ""the capacity to be navigated in and upon the waters.""  The
Alabama, supra, at 546; see also  The Pioneer, supra, at 207;  The International
, 89 F. 484, 485 (CA3 1898).

This Court also treated dredges as vessels prior to the passage of the Jones Act
and the LHWCA.  It did so in a pair of cases, first implicitly in The ""Virginia
Ehrman"" and the ""Agnese,""  97 U.S. 309, 24 L. Ed. 890  [***944]  (1878), and
then explicitly in  Ellis v. United States, 206 U.S. 246, 51 L. Ed. 1047, 27 S.
Ct. 600, 5 Ohio L. Rep. 427 (1907).  In Ellis, this Court considered, inter alia
, whether workers aboard various dredges and scows were covered by a federal
labor law.  Just as in the present case, one of the Ellis appellants argued that
the dredges at issue were ""vessels"" within the meaning of Rev Stat § 3, now 1
U.S.C. § 3[1 USCS § 3].  206 U.S., at 249, 51 L. Ed. 1047, 27 S. Ct. 600.  The
United States responded that dredges were only vessels, if at all, when in
actual navigation as they were ""towed from port to port.""  Id., at 253, 51 L.
Ed. 1047, 27 S. Ct. 600.  Citing § 3, Justice Holmes rejected the Government's
argument, stating that ""[t]he scows and floating dredges were vessels"" that
""were within the admiralty jurisdiction of the United States.""  Id., at 259, 51
L. Ed. 1047, 27 S. Ct. 600.

[***LEdHR1A] [1C] These early cases show that at the time Congress enacted the
Jones Act and the LHWCA in the 1920's, it was settled that § 3 defined the term
""vessel"" for purposes of those statutes.  It was also settled that a structure's
status as a vessel under § 3 depended on whether the structure was a means of
maritime transportation. See R. Hughes, Handbook of  [*492]  Admiralty Law
[**1126]  § 5, p 14 (2d ed. 1920).  For then, as now, dredges served a
waterborne transportation function, since in performing their work they carried
machinery, equipment, and crew over water. See, e.g.,  Butler v. Ellis, 45 F.2d
951, 955 (CA4 1930) (finding the vessel status of dredges ""sustained by the
overwhelming weight of authority"");  The Hurricane, 2 F.2d 70, 72 (ED Pa. 1924)
(expressing ""no doubt"" that dredges are vessels), aff'd,  9 F.2d 396 (CA3 1925).

This Court's cases have continued to treat § 3 as defining the term ""vessel"" in
the LHWCA, and they have continued to construe § 3's definition in light of the
term's established meaning in general maritime law. For instance, in  Norton v.
Warner Co., 321 U.S. 565, 88 L. Ed. 931, 64 S. Ct. 747 (1944), the Court
considered whether a worker on a harbor barge was ""a master or member of a crew
of any vessel"" under the LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. § 902(3)(G)[33 USCS § 902(3)(G)].  In
finding that the ""barge [was] a vessel within the meaning of the Act,"" the Court
not only quoted § 3's definition of the term ""vessel,"" but it also cited in
support of its holding several earlier cases that had held dredges to be vessels
based on the general maritime law.  321 U.S., at 571, and n 4, 88 L. Ed. 931, 64
S. Ct. 747.  This Court therefore confirmed in Norton that § 3 defines the term
""vessel"" in the LHWCA and that § 3 should be construed consistently with the
general maritime law. Since Norton, this Court has often said that dredges and
comparable watercraft qualify as vessels under the Jones Act and the LHWCA. 6

Despite this Court's reliance on § 3 in cases like Ellis and Norton, Dutra
argues that the Court has implicitly narrowed § 3's definition.  Section 3 says
that a ""vessel"" must be ""used, or capable of being used, as a means of
transportation on water."" 18 Stat, pt 1, p 1.  In a pair of cases, the Court
held that a drydock,  Cope v. Vallette Dry Dock Co., 119 U.S. 625, 630, 30 L.
Ed. 501, 7 S. Ct. 336 (1887), and a wharfboat attached to the mainland,
Evansville & Bowling Green Packet Co. v. Chero Cola Bottling Co., 271 U.S. 19,
22, 70 L. Ed. 805, 46 S. Ct. 379 (1926), were not vessels under § 3, because
they were not practically capable of being used to transport people, freight, or
cargo from place to place.  According to Dutra, Cope and Evansville adopted a
definition of ""vessel"" narrower than § 3's text.

Dutra misreads Cope and Evansville. In Cope, the plaintiff sought a salvage
award for having prevented a drydock from sinking after a steamship collided
with it.   119 U.S., at 625-626, 30 L. Ed. 501, 7 S. Ct. 336.  At the time of
the accident, the drydock, a floating dock used for repairing vessels, was
""moored and lying at [the] usual place"" it had occupied for the past 20 years.
Id., at 626, 30 L. Ed. 501, 7 S. Ct. 336.  In those circumstances, the drydock
was a ""fixed structure"" that had been ""permanently moored,"" rather than a vessel
that had been temporarily anchored.   Id., at 627, 30 L. Ed. 2d 501, 7 S. Ct.
336.  Evansville involved a wharfboat [**1127]  secured by cables to the
mainland.  Local water, electricity, and telephone lines all ran from shore to
the wharfboat, evincing a ""permanent location.""  271 U.S., at 22, 70 L. Ed. 805,
46 S. Ct. 379.  And the wharfboat, like the drydock in Cope, was neither ""taken
from place to place"" nor ""used to carry freight from one place to another.""  271
U.S., at 22, 77 L. Ed. 805, 46 S. Ct. 379.  As in Cope, the Court concluded that
the wharfboat ""was not practically capable of being used as a means of
transportation.""  271 U.S., at 22, 70 L. Ed. 805, 46 S. Ct. 379.

[***LEdHR6] [6] Cope and Evansville did no more than construe § 3 in light of
the distinction drawn by the general maritime law between watercraft temporarily
stationed in a particular location and those permanently affixed to shore or
resting on the  [*494]  ocean floor. See, e.g.,  The Alabama, 19 F., at 546
(noting that vessels possess ""mobility and [the] capacity to navigate,"" as
distinct from fixed structures like wharves,  drydocks, and bridges).  Simply
put,  [HN3] a watercraft is not ""capable of being used"" for maritime transport
in any meaningful sense if it has been permanently moored or otherwise rendered
practically incapable of transportation or movement.

[***LEdHR7A] [7A] This distinction is sensible: A ship and its crew do not move
in and out of Jones Act coverage depending on whether the ship is at anchor,
docked for loading or unloading, or berthed for minor repairs, in the same way
that ships taken permanently out of the water as a practical matter do not
remain vessels merely because of the remote possibility that they may one day
sail again.  See  Pavone v. Mississippi Riverboat Amusement Corp., 52 F.3d 560,
570 (CA5 1995) (floating casino was no  [***946]  longer a vessel where it ""was
moored to the shore in a semi-permanent or indefinite manner"");  Kathriner v.
Unisea, Inc., 975 F.2d 657, 660 (CA9 1992) (floating processing plant was no
longer a vessel where a ""large opening [had been] cut into her hull,"" rendering
her incapable of moving over the water).  Even if the general maritime law had
not informed the meaning of § 3, its definition would not sweep within its reach
an array of fixed structures not commonly thought of as capable of being used
for water transport. See, e.g.,  Leocal v. Ashcroft, ante,  at 9, 160 L. Ed. 2d
271, 125 S. Ct. 377 (2004) [HN4] (""When interpreting a statute, we must give
words their 'ordinary or natural' meaning"" (quoting  Smith v. United States, 508
U.S. 223, 228, 124 L. Ed. 2d 138, 113 S. Ct. 2050 (1993))).

[***LEdHR8] [8] Applying § 3 brings within the purview of the Jones Act the
sorts of watercraft considered vessels at the time Congress passed the Act.  By
including special-purpose vessels like dredges, § 3 sweeps broadly, but the
other prerequisites to qualifying for seaman status under the Jones Act provide
some limits, notwithstanding § 3's breadth.  A maritime worker seeking Jones Act
seaman status must also prove that his duties contributed to the vessel's
function or mission,  [*495]  and that his connection to the vessel was
substantial both in nature and duration.   Chandris, 515 U.S., at 376, 132 L.
Ed. 2d 314, 115 S. Ct. 2172.  Thus, even though the Super Scoop is a ""vessel,""
workers injured aboard the Super Scoop are eligible for seaman status only if
they are ""master[s] or member[s]"" of its crew.

C

[***LEdHR2A] [2B] The Court of Appeals, relying on its previous en banc decision
in  DiGiovanni v. Traylor Brothers, Inc., 959 F.2d 1119 (CA1 1992), held that
the Super Scoop is not a ""vessel"" because its primary purpose is not navigation
or commerce and because it was not in actual transit at the time of Stewart's
injury.   230 F.3d at 468-469.  Neither prong of the Court of Appeals' test is
consistent with the text of § 3 or [**1128]  the established meaning of the term
""vessel"" in general maritime law.

[***LEdHR2A] [2C]  [***LEdHR9A] [9A] [HN5] Section 3requires only that a
watercraft be ""used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on
water"" to qualify as a vessel. It does not require that a watercraft be used
primarily for that purpose.  See  The Alabama, supra, at 546;  The International
, 89 F., at 485.  As the Court of Appeals recognized, the Super Scoop's
""function was to move through Boston Harbor, . . . digging the ocean bottom as
it moved.""  343 F.3d, at 12.  In other words, the Super Scoop was not only
""capable of being used"" to transport equipment and workers over water--it was
used to transport those things.  Indeed, it could not have dug the Ted Williams
Tunnel had it been unable to traverse the Boston Harbor, carrying with it
workers like Stewart.

[***LEdHR7A] [7B]  [***LEdHR9A] [9B] Also,  [HN6] a watercraft need not be in
motion to qualify as a vessel under § 3.  Looking to whether a watercraft is
motionless or moving is the sort of ""snapshot"" test that we rejected in
Chandris. Just as a worker does not ""oscillate back and forth between Jones Act
coverage and other remedies depending on the activity in which the worker was
engaged while injured,""  Chandris, 515 U.S., at 363, 132 L. Ed. 2d 314, 115 S.
Ct. 2172, neither does a watercraft pass in and out of Jones Act coverage
[***947]   [*496]  depending on whether it was moving at the time of the
accident.

[***LEdHR10A] [10A] Granted, the Court has sometimes spoken of the requirement
that a vessel be ""in navigation,""  id., at 373-374, 132 L. Ed. 2d 314, 115 S.
Ct. 2172, but never to indicate that a structure's locomotion at any given
moment mattered.  Rather, the point was that  [HN7] structures may lose their
character as vessels if they have been withdrawn from the water for extended
periods of time.  Ibid.;  Roper v. United States, 368 U.S. 20, 21, 23, 7 L. Ed.
2d 1, 82 S. Ct. 5 (1961);  West v. United States, 361 U.S. 118, 122, 4 L. Ed. 2d
161, 80 S. Ct. 189 (1959).  The Court did not mean that the ""in navigation""
requirement stood apart from § 3, such that a ""vessel"" for purposes of § 3 might
nevertheless not be a ""vessel in navigation"" for purposes of the Jones Act or
the LHWCA.  See, e.g.,  United States v. Templeton, 378 F.3d 845, 851 (CA8 2004)
(""[T]he definition of 'vessel in navigation' under the Jones Act is not as
expansive as the general definition of 'vessel'"").

[***LEdHR2A] [2D]  [***LEdHR10A] [10B] Instead, the ""in navigation"" requirement
is an element of the vessel status of a watercraft. It is relevant to whether
the craft is ""used, or capable of being used"" for maritime transportation. A
ship long lodged in a drydock or shipyard can again be put to sea, no less than
one permanently moored to shore or the ocean floor can be cut loose and made to
sail.  The question remains in all cases whether the watercraft's use ""as a
means of transportation on water"" is a practical possibility or merely a
theoretical one.   Supra, at 493, 160 L. Ed. 2d, at 945-946.  In some cases that
inquiry may involve factual issues for the jury,  Chandris, supra, at 373, 132
L. Ed. 2d 314, 115 S. Ct. 2172, but here no relevant facts were in dispute.
Dutra conceded that the Super Scoop was only temporarily stationary while
Stewart and others were repairing the scow; the Super Scoop had not been taken
out of service, permanently anchored, or otherwise rendered practically
incapable of maritime transport.

[***LEdHR5A] [5C] Finally, although Dutra argues that the Super Scoop is not a
""vessel"" under § 902(3)(G), which is the LHWCA provision that excludes seamen
from the Act's coverage, Dutra conceded  [*497]  below that the Super Scoop is a
""vessel"" under § 905(b), which is the LHWCA p"
"           ULYSSES TORY, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. JOHNNIE L. COCHRAN, JR.",544 U.S. 734,"

 [*735]  [**2110]  [***1046]    JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the
Court.

Johnnie Cochran brought a state-law defamation action against petitioner Ulysses
Tory. The state trial court determined that Tory (with the help of petitioner
Ruth Craft and others) had engaged in unlawful defamatory activity. It found,
for example, that Tory, while claiming falsely that Cochran owed him money, had
complained to the local bar association, had written Cochran threatening letters
demanding $ 10 million, had picketed Cochran's office holding up signs
containing various insults and obscenities; and, with a group of associates, had
pursued Cochran while chanting similar threats and insults. App. 38, 40-41. The
court concluded that Tory's claim that Cochran owed him money was without
foundation, that Tory engaged in a continuous  [***1047]  pattern of libelous
and slanderous activity, and that Tory had  [*736]  used false and defamatory
speech to ""coerce"" Cochran into paying ""amounts of money to which Tory was not
entitled"" as a ""tribute"" or a ""premium"" for ""desisting"" from this libelous and
slanderous activity. Id., at 39, 42-43.

After noting that Tory had indicated that he would continue to engage in this
activity in the absence of a court order, the Superior Court issued a permanent
injunction. The injunction, among other things, prohibited Tory, Craft, and
their ""agents"" or ""representatives"" from ""picketing,"" from ""displaying signs,
placards or other written or printed material,"" and from ""orally uttering
statements"" about Johnnie L. Cochran, Jr., and about Cochran's law firm in ""any
public forum."" Id., at 34.

Tory and Craft appealed. The California Court of Appeal affirmed. Tory and Craft
then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, raising the following question:

""Whether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation action, preventing
all future speech about an admitted public figure, violates the First Amendment
."" Pet. for Cert. i.

After oral argument, Cochran's counsel informed the Court of Johnnie Cochran's
recent death. Counsel also moved to substitute Johnnie Cochran's widow, Sylvia
Dale Mason Cochran, as respondent, and suggested that we dismiss the case as
moot. Tory and Craft filed a response agreeing to the substitution of Ms.
Cochran. But they denied that the case was moot.

We agree with Tory and Craft that the case is not moot. Despite Johnnie
Cochran's death, the injunction remains in effect. Nothing in its language says
to the contrary. Cochran's counsel tells us that California law does not
recognize a ""cause of action for an injury to the memory of a deceased person's
reputation,"" see  Kelly v. Johnson Pub. Co., 160 Cal. App. 2d 718, 325 P.2d 659
(1958), which circumstance, counsel believes, ""moots"" a ""portion"" of the
injunction  [*737]  (the portion ""personal to Cochran""). Respondent's Suggestion
of Death,  etc., 4 (emphasis added). But counsel adds that ""the injunction
continues to be necessary, valid and enforceable."" Id., at 9. The parties have
not identified, nor have we found, any source of California law that says the
injunction here automatically becomes invalid upon Cochran's death, not even the
portion personal to  [**2111]  Cochran. Counsel also points to the ""value of""
Cochran's ""law practice"" and adds that his widow has an interest in enforcing
the injunction. Id., at 11 -- 12. And, as we understand  [HN1] California law, a
person cannot definitively know whether an injunction is legally void until a
court has ruled that it is. See  Mason v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co.,
60 Cal. App. 2d 587, 591, 141 P.2d 475, 477-478 (1943) (""Where the party served
believes"" a court order ""invalid he should take the proper steps to have it
dissolved"");  People v. Gonzalez, 12 Cal. 4th 804, 818, 50 Cal. Rptr. 2d 74, 910
P.2d 1366, 1375 (1996) (""[A] person subject to a court's injunction may elect
whether to challenge the constitutional validity of the injunction when it is
issued, or to reserve that claim until a violation of the injunction  [***1048]
is charged as a contempt of court""). Given the uncertainty of California law, we
take it as a given that the  [HN2] injunction here continues significantly to
restrain petitioners' speech, presenting an ongoing federal controversy. See,
e.g.,  Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 486-487, 14 L. Ed. 2d 22, 85 S. Ct.
1116 (1965);  NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 432-433, 9 L. Ed. 2d 405, 83 S. Ct.
328 (1963). Consequently, we need not, and we do not, dismiss this case as moot.
Cf.  Firefighters v. Stotts, 467 U.S. 561, 569, 81 L. Ed. 2d 483, 104 S. Ct.
2576 (1984) (case not moot in part because it appears from ""terms"" of the
injunction that it is ""still in force"" and ""unless set aside must be complied
with"").

At the same time, Johnnie Cochran's death makes it unnecessary, indeed
unwarranted, for us to explore petitioners' basic claims, namely, (1) that the
First Amendment forbids the issuance of a permanent injunction in a defamation
case, at least when the plaintiff is a public figure, and (2) that  [*738]  the
injunction (considered prior to Cochran's death) was not properly tailored and
consequently violated the First Amendment. See Brief for Petitioners ii, iii.
Rather, we need only point out that the injunction, as written, has now lost its
underlying rationale.  Since picketing Cochran and his law offices while
engaging in injunction-forbidden speech could no longer achieve the objectives
that the trial court had in mind (i.e., coercing Cochran to pay a ""tribute"" for
desisting in this activity), the grounds for the injunction are much diminished,
if they have not disappeared altogether. Consequently the injunction, as
written, now amounts to an overly broad prior restraint upon speech, lacking
plausible justification. See  Nebraska Press Ass'n v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 559,
49 L. Ed. 2d 683, 96 S. Ct. 2791 (1976)  [HN3] (""Prior restraints on speech and
publication are the most serious and the least tolerable infringement on First
Amendment rights"");  Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human
Relations, 413 U.S. 376, 390, 37 L. Ed. 2d 669, 93 S. Ct. 2553 (1973) (a prior
restraint should not ""sweep"" any ""more broadly than necessary""). As such, the
Constitution forbids it. See  Carroll v. President and Comm'rs of Princess Anne,
393 U.S. 175, 183-184, 21 L. Ed. 2d 325, 89 S. Ct. 347 (1968) (An ""order"" issued
in ""the area of First Amendment rights"" must be ""precise"" and narrowly
""tailored"" to achieve the ""pin-pointed objective"" of the ""needs of the case"");
see also  Board of Airport Comm'rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482
U.S. 569, 575, 577, 96 L. Ed. 2d 500, 107 S. Ct. 2568 (1987) (regulation
prohibiting ""all 'First Amendment activities'"" substantially overbroad).

We consequently grant the motion to substitute Sylvia Dale Mason Cochran for
Johnnie Cochran as respondent. We vacate the judgment of the California Court of
Appeal, and we remand the case for proceedings not inconsistent with this
opinion. If, as the Cochran supplemental brief suggests, injunctive relief may
still be  [**2112]  warranted, any appropriate party remains free to ask for
such relief. We express no view on the constitutional validity of any such new
relief,  [*739]  tailored to these changed circumstances, should it be entered.

It is so ordered.

 [***1049]  JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins, dissenting.

I would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted. We granted the
writ, as the Court notes, to decide

""whether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation action, preventing
all future speech about an admitted public figure, violates the First Amendment
."" Pet. for Cert. i; ante, at 736, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1042.

Whether or not Johnnie Cochran's death moots this case, it certainly renders the
case an inappropriate vehicle for resolving the question presented. The Court
recognizes this,  ante, at 737-738, 161 L. Ed 2d 1042, but nevertheless vacates
the judgment below, ante, at 738, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1042. It does so only after
deciding, as it must to exercise jurisdiction, that in light of the uncertainty
in California law, the case is not moot. Ante, at 736-737, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1042;
ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U.S. 605, 621, n. 1, 104 L. Ed. 2d 696, 109 S. Ct.
2037 (1989) (when a case coming from a state court becomes moot, this Court
""lacks jurisdiction and thus also the power to disturb the state court's
judgment""); see also  City News & Novelty, Inc. v. Waukesha, 531 U.S. 278,
283-284, 148 L. Ed. 2d 757, 121 S. Ct. 743 (2001).

In deciding the threshold mootness issue, a complicated problem in its own
right, the Court strains to reach the validity of the injunction after Cochran's
death. Whether the injunction remains valid in these changed circumstances is
neither the reason we took this case nor an important question, but merely a
matter of case-specific error correction. Petitioners remain free to seek relief
on both constitutional and state-law grounds in the California courts. And, if
the injunction is invalid, they need not obey it: California does not recognize
the ""collateral bar"" rule, and thus permits collateral challenges to injunctions
in contempt proceedings.  [*740]   People v. Gonzalez, 12 Cal. 4th 804, 818, 50
Cal. Rptr. 2d 74, 910 P.2d 1366, 1375 (1996) (a person subject to an injunction
may challenge ""the constitutional validity of the injunction when it is issued,
or . . . reserve that claim until a violation of the injunction is charged as a
contempt of court""). The California courts can resolve the matter and, given the
new state of affairs, might very well adjudge the case moot or the injunction
invalid on state-law grounds rather than the constitutional grounds the Court
rushes to embrace. As a prudential matter, the better course is to avoid passing
unnecessarily on the constitutional question. See  Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S.
288, 345-348, 80 L. Ed. 688, 56 S. Ct. 466 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).

The Court purports to save petitioners the uncertainty of possible enforcement
of the injunction, and thereby to prevent any chill on their First Amendment
rights, by vacating the judgment below. But what the Court gives with the left
hand it takes with the right, for it only invites further litigation by
pronouncing that ""injunctive relief may still be warranted,"" conceding that ""any
appropriate party remains free to ask for such relief,  "" and ""expressing no
view on the constitutional validity of any such new relief."" Ante, at  [***1050]
738-739, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1042. What the Court means by ""any appropriate party"" is
unclear. Perhaps the Court means Sylvia Dale Mason Cochran, Cochran's widow, who
has taken his place in this suit. Or perhaps it means the Cochran firm, which
has never been a party to this case, but may now (if ""appropriate"") intervene
and attempt to enjoin the defamation  [**2113] of a now-deceased third party.
The Court's decision invites the doubts it seeks to avoid. Its decision is
unnecessary and potentially self-defeating. The more prudent course is to
dismiss the writ as improvidently granted. I respectfully dissent.

 [*211]   [**689]  Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A] These cases present the question whether conviction for
conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h) [18
USCS § 1956(h)], requires proof of an overt act in furtherance of the
conspiracy. We hold that it does not.

I

In March 1999, a federal grand jury returned a 20-count indictment against
petitioners and five codefendants.  As relevant here, Count II of the indictment
charged petitioners with conspiracy to launder money, in violation of § 1956(h).
The indictment described, in general terms, the ""manner and means"" used to
accomplish the objects of the money laundering conspiracy, but it did not charge
the defendants with the commission of any overt act in furtherance thereof.

At trial, the Government presented evidence that petitioners were members of the
executive board of an entity known as Greater Ministries International Church
(GMIC).  GMIC operated a ""gifting"" program that took in more than $400 million
between 1996 and 1999.  Under that program, petitioners and others induced
unwary investors to give money to GMIC with promises that investors would
receive double their money back within a year and a half.  Petitioners marketed
the program throughout the country, claiming that GMIC would generate returns on
investors' ""gifts"" through overseas investments in gold and diamond mining,
commodities, and offshore banks.  Investors were told that GMIC would use some
of the profits for philanthropic purposes.  Most of  [***616]  these claims were
false.  GMIC made none of the promised investments, had no assets, and gave
virtually nothing to charity.  Many participants in GMIC's program received
little or no return on their money, and their investments indeed largely turned
out to be ""gifts"" to GMIC representatives.  Petitioners together allegedly
received more than $1.2 million in commissions on the money they solicited.

[**690]   [*212]  At the close of the evidence, petitioners asked the District
Court to instruct the jury that the Government was required to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that at least one of the co-conspirators had committed an overt
act in furtherance of the money laundering conspiracy. The court denied that
request, and the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the money laundering
conspiracy charge.

[***LEdHR1A] [1B]  [***LEdHR2A] [2A] The Eleventh Circuit affirmed petitioners'
convictions, holding, in relevant part, that the jury instructions approved by
the District Court were proper because § 1956(h) does not require proof of an
overt act.  349 F.3d 1320, 1324 (2003).  The Court of Appeals noted that some of
its sister Circuits had taken the opposite position.   Id., at 1323 (citing
United States v. Wilson, 249 F.3d 366, 379 (CA5 2001);  United States v.
Hildebrand, 152 F.3d 756, 762 (CA8 1998)).  It concluded, however, that those
decisions were erroneously based on case law interpreting the general conspiracy
statute, 18 U.S.C. § 371 [18 USCS § 371], which, unlike § 1956(h), expressly
includes an overt-act requirement.   349 F.3d, at 1323.  The Eleventh Circuit
instead relied upon  United States v. Shabani, 513 U.S. 10, 130 L. Ed. 2d 225,
115 S. Ct. 382 (1994), where we held that the drug conspiracy statute, 21 U.S.C.
§ 846 [21 USCS § 846], does not require proof of an overt act. Because the
language of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h) [18 USCS § 1956(h)] and 21 U.S.C. § 846 [21 USCS
§ 846] is ""nearly identical,"" the Eleventh Circuit found itself compelled to
follow the reasoning of Shabani in holding that § 1956(h), too, requires no
proof of an overt act.  349 F.3d, at 1323-1324. We granted certiorari to resolve
the conflict among the Circuits on the question presented, 542 U.S. 918, 159 L.
Ed. 2d 775, 124 S. Ct. 2871 (2004), and we now affirm the decision below.

II

[***LEdHR1A] [1C] Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. §§ 1956 and 1957 (2000 ed. and
Supp. II) [18 USCS §§ 1956 and 1957] as part of the Money Laundering Control Act
of 1986, Pub L 99-570, 100 Stat 3207-18.   [HN1] Section 1956 penalizes the
knowing and intentional transportation or transfer of monetary proceeds from
specified unlawful activities,  [*213]  while § 1957 addresses transactions
involving criminally derived property exceeding $10,000 in value.  As originally
enacted, neither section included a conspiracy provision.  Accordingly, the
Government relied on the general conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. § 371 [18 USCS §
371], to prosecute conspiracies to commit the offenses set forth in §§ 1956 and
1957.  In 1992, however, Congress enacted the money laundering conspiracy
provision at issue in these cases, now codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h) [18 USCS
§ 1956(h)].  See Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act, Pub. L. 102-550, §
1530, 106 Stat. 4066.  Section 1956(h) provides:  [HN2] ""Any person who
conspires to commit any offense defined in [§ 1956] or section 1957 shall
[***617]  be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense
the commission of which was the object of the conspiracy.""

[***LEdHR1A] [1D]  [***LEdHR2A] [2B] In Shabani, we addressed whether the nearly
identical language of the drug conspiracy statute, 21 U.S.C. § 846 [21 USCS §
846], requires proof of an overt act. See ibid. (""Any person who attempts or
conspires to commit any offense defined in this subchapter shall be subject to
the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the commission of which
was the object of the attempt or conspiracy"").  We held that it does not,
relying principally upon our earlier decisions in  Nash v. United States, 229
U.S. 373, 57 L. Ed. 1232, 33 S. Ct. 780 (1913), and  Singer v. United States,
323 U.S. 338, 89 L. Ed. 285, 65 S. Ct. 282 (1945).  See  Shabani, supra, at
13-14, 130 L. Ed. 2d 225, 115 S. Ct. 382.  In each of those cases, the Court
held that, where Congress had omitted from the relevant conspiracy provision any
[**691]  language expressly requiring an overt act, the Court would not read
such a requirement into the statute.  See  Singer, supra, at 340, 89 L. Ed. 285,
65 S. Ct. 282 (Selective Training and Service Act of 1940);  Nash, supra, at
378, 57 L. Ed. 1232, 33 S. Ct. 780 (Sherman Act).

[***LEdHR2A] [2C]  [***LEdHR3] [3] As we explained in Shabani, these decisions
""follow the settled principle of statutory construction that,  [HN3] absent
contrary indications, Congress intends to adopt the common law definition of
statutory terms.  See  Molzof v. United States, 502 U.S. 301, 307-308, 116 L.
Ed. 2d 731, 112 S. Ct. 711 (1992).  We have consistently held that  [HN4] the
common law understanding of conspiracy 'does not  [*214]  make the doing of any
act other than the act of conspiring a condition of liability.'""  513 U.S., at
13-14, 130 L. Ed. 2d 225, 115 S. Ct. 382 (quoting  Nash, supra, at 378, 57 L.
Ed. 1232, 33 S. Ct. 780).  In concluding that the drug conspiracy statute in
Shabani did not require proof of an overt act, we found instructive the
distinction between that statute and the general conspiracy statute, § 371,
which supersedes the common law rule by expressly including an overt-act
requirement.   513 U.S., at 14, 130 L. Ed. 2d 225, 115 S. Ct. 382.  See 18
U.S.C. § 371 [18 USCS § 371] (""If two or more persons conspire either to commit
any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any
agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons
do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined under
this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both"" (emphasis added)).

[***LEdHR1A] [1E]  [***LEdHR2A] [2D] Shabani distilled the governing rule for
conspiracy statutes as follows: ""'Nash and Singer give Congress a formulary: by
choosing a text modeled on § 371, it gets an overt-act requirement; by choosing
a text modeled on the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 [15 USCS § 1] [which, like 21
U.S.C. § 846 [21 USCS § 846], omits any express overt-act requirement], it
dispenses with such a requirement.'""  513 U.S., at 14, 130 L. Ed. 2d 225, 115 S.
Ct. 382 (quoting  United States v. Sassi, 966 F.2d 283, 284 (CA7 1992)).  This
rule dictates the outcome in the instant cases as well:  [HN5] Because the text
of § 1956(h) does not expressly make the commission of an overt act an element
of the conspiracy offense, the Government need not prove an overt act to obtain
a conviction.

[***618]  III

[***LEdHR1A] [1F] Petitioners argue that the rule that governed Shabani is
inapplicable here, because § 1956(h) does not establish a new conspiracy
offense; rather, they say, it merely increases the penalty for conviction of a
money laundering conspiracy under § 371.  In other words, as we understand their
argument, petitioners contend that the Government must continue to prosecute
money laundering conspiracies under § 371, but that § 1956(h) now provides
enhanced penalties for  [*215]  conviction.  Since § 371 contains an overt act
requirement, the argument goes, the Government must prove an overt act in
prosecutions ostensibly brought under § 1956(h).  This reading of § 1956(h) is
untenable for two principal reasons.  First, petitioners concede--as they
must--that § 1956(h)'s text is sufficient to establish an offense.  Indeed, its
language is nearly identical to the drug conspiracy statute at issue in Shabani,
which indisputably created an offense.  Second, petitioners apparently read §
1956(h) to supply an enhanced penalty for violation of § 371 in cases where the
object of the conspiracy is to violate the substantive money laundering offenses
in §§ 1956(a) and 1957.  But the text of § 1956(h) fails to provide any
cross-reference to § 371.  Mere use of the word ""conspires"" surely is not enough
to establish the necessary link between these two separate statutes.  In short,
if Congress had intended to create the scheme petitioners [**692]  envision, it
would have done so in clearer terms.

Petitioners seek support for their construction of § 1956(h) in the provision's
legislative history. They contend that this history contains no indication that
Congress meant to create a new offense or to eliminate the pre-existing
overt-act requirement for money laundering conspiracy prosecutions that hitherto
had been brought under § 371.  They say that the history instead shows that §
1956(h) was intended only to raise the penalty for money laundering conspiracy
from the 5-year maximum sentence under § 371 to the greater maximums available
for substantive money laundering offenses under §§ 1956(a) and 1957.
Petitioners also point out that, when Congress enacted § 1956(h), it did so
under the title ""Penalty for Money Laundering Conspiracies,"" 106 Stat., at 4066
(emphasis added).  Had Congress wanted to enact an ""offense"" provision, they
argue, it would have titled it accordingly.

Because the meaning of § 1956(h)'s text is plain and unambiguous, we need not
accept petitioners' invitation to consider the legislative history. But even
were we to do so,  [*216]  we would reach the same conclusion.   [HN6] It is
undisputed that Congress intended § 1956(h) to increase the penalties for money
laundering conspiracies. The provision's text makes clear that Congress did so
precisely by establishing a new offense. Given the clarity of the text, mere
silence in the legislative history cannot justify reading an overt-act
requirement, or a cross-reference to § 371, into § 1956(h).  See, e.g.,  United
States v. Wells, 519 U.S. 482, 496-497, 137 L. Ed. 2d 107, 117 S. Ct. 921 (1997)
(refusing to read a materiality element into the statute at issue based on
silence in the legislative history);  Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S.
578, 592, 64 L. Ed. 2d 525, 100 S. Ct. 1889 (1980) (""[I]t would be a strange
canon of statutory construction that would require Congress to  [***619]  state
in committee reports or elsewhere in its deliberations that which is obvious on
the face of a statute"").  Nor do we find it significant that Congress chose to
label § 1956(h) a ""penalty"" rather than an ""offense"" provision.  See
Pennsylvania Dep't of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212, 141 L. Ed. 2d
215, 118 S. Ct. 1952 (1998) (""'[T]he title of a statute . . . cannot limit the
plain meaning of the text'"");  Castillo v. United States, 530 U.S. 120, 125, 147
L. Ed. 2d 94, 120 S. Ct. 2090 (2000) (although ""[t]he title of the entirety of §
924 is 'Penalties' . . . at least some portion of § 924 . . . creates, not
penalty enhancements, but entirely new crimes"").

[***LEdHR1A] [1G]  [***LEdHR2A] [2E] Petitioners' legislative history argument
is particularly inapt here, we might add, because Congress is presumed to have
knowledge of the governing rule described in Shabani. While Shabani was decided
two years after § 1956(h) was enacted, the rule it articulated was established
decades earlier in Nash and Singer These decisions establish a ""formulary"" that
provides clear and predictable guidance to Congress.  As the Government points
out, Congress has included an express overt-act requirement in at least 22 other
current conspiracy statutes, clearly demonstrating that it knows how to impose
such a requirement when it wishes to do so.  See Brief for United States 11, and
n 5 (citing statutes).  Where Congress has chosen not to do so, we will  [*217]
not override that choice based on vague and ambiguous signals from legislative
history.

[***LEdHR1A] [1H] We conclude by addressing two arguments raised by petitioners
relating to the text and structure of § 1956 as a whole.  First, petitioners
note that Congress placed each of the three substantive money laundering
offenses in § 1956 under subsection (a).  [**693]  Had the drafters intended §
1956(h)  to create a new offense, petitioners contend, they would have placed it
with the other offenses in subsection (a) instead of in its own separate
subsection.  We fail to see why that should be so.  The three offenses placed in
subsection (a) share a common feature: All are substantive money-laundering
crimes.  We find nothing remarkable in Congress' decision to place a
qualitatively different conspiracy offense provision in a separate subsection.

Petitioners' second textual argument is based on § 1956(i) (2000 ed., Supp. II),
a venue provision added to the statute in 2001.  See USA PATRIOT ACT, Pub. L.
107-56, § 1004, 115 Stat. 392.  Section 1956(i)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. II) provides
that ""[a] prosecution for an attempt or conspiracy offense under [§ 1956 or §
1957] may be brought in the district where venue would lie for the completed
offense under [§ 1956(i)(1)], or in any other district where an act in
furtherance of the attempt or conspiracy took place."" Petitioners contend that,
by setting venue in the district where an overt act took place, Congress
confirmed what (petitioners say) was the majority view of the Courts of Appeals
at the time of § 1956(i)'s enactment:  that proof of an overt act was required
under § 1956(h).  Moreover, petitioners argue, setting venue where an overt act
took place makes little sense if such an act is not an element of the offense.

This argument fails for several reasons.  As a preliminary matter, petitioners
assume that § 1956(i) is the sole provision setting venue in money laundering
conspiracy prosecutions.  Although we need not definitively construe that
provision  [***620]  here, we note that its language appears permissive rather
[*218]  than exclusive--§ 1956(i) says a conspiracy prosecution ""may be brought""
in a district meeting the specified criteria.  (Emphasis added.) This suggests
that the provision serves to supplement, rather than supplant, the default venue
rule:  [HN7]  ""Unless a statute or these rules permit otherwise, the government
must prosecute an offense in a district where the offense was committed."" Fed.
R. Crim. P. 18.  For a conspiracy prosecution under the common law rule, the
district in which the unlawful agreement was reached would satisfy this default
venue rule.  See  Hyde v. Shine, 199 U.S. 62, 76, 50 L. Ed. 90, 25 S. Ct. 760
(1905).

But even if we assume, for the sake of argument, that § 1956(i) is an exclusive
venue provision, petitioners' argument still fails.   [HN8] The provision
authorizes two alternative venues for money laundering conspiracy prosecutions:
(1) the district in which venue would lie if the completed substantive money
laundering offense had been accomplished, or (2) any district in which an overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy was committed.  The first venue option
clearly does not require that any overt act have been committed, and the
Government therefore need not allege or prove such an act for venue to be
properly established under this portion of § 1956(i).  As to the second venue
option, this Court has long held that venue is proper in any district in which
an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy was committed, even where an overt
act is not a required element of the conspiracy offense.  See, e.g.,  United
States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 252, 84 L. Ed. 1129, 60 S. Ct.
811 (1940);  United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., 273 U.S. 392, 402-404, 71
L. Ed. 700, 47 S. Ct. 377 (1927).  In light of this longstanding rule, §
1956(i)(2)'s authorization of venue in a district where an overt act took place
cannot be taken to indicate that Congress deemed such an act necessary for
conviction under [**694] § 1956(h). Instead, Congress appears merely to have
confirmed the availability of this alternative venue option in money laundering
conspiracy cases.


     * * *



 [*219]  For the reasons set forth above, we hold that  [HN9] conviction for
conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h) [18
USCS § 1956(h)], does not require proof of an overt act in furtherance of the
conspiracy. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

 [**707]   [*134]  Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court.

[HN1]  [***LEdHR1A] [1A] A civil case commenced in state court may, as a general
matter, be removed by the defendant to federal district court, if the case could
have been brought there originally.  28 U.S.C. § 1441 (2000 ed. and Supp. II).
If it appears that the federal court lacks jurisdiction, however, ""the case
shall be remanded."" § 1447(c).  An order remanding a removed case to state court
""may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney
fees, incurred as a result of the removal."" Ibid. Although § 1447(c) expressly
permits an award of attorney's fees, it provides little guidance on when such
fees are warranted.  We granted certiorari to determine the proper standard for
awarding attorney's fees when remanding a case to state court.

I

Petitioners Gerald and Juana Martin filed a class-action lawsuit in New Mexico
state court against respondents Franklin Capital Corporation and
Century-National Insurance Company (collectively, Franklin).  Franklin removed
the case to Federal District Court on the basis of diversity of citizenship.
See §§ 1332, 1441 (2000 ed. and Supp. II).  In its removal notice, Franklin
acknowledged that the amount in controversy was not clear from the face of the
complaint--no reason it should be, since the complaint had been filed in state
court--but argued that this requirement [**708]  for federal diversity
jurisdiction was nonetheless satisfied.  In so arguing, Franklin relied in part
on precedent suggesting that punitive damages and attorney's fees could be
aggregated in a class action to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement.  See
App. 35.

Fifteen months later, the Martins moved to remand to state court on the ground
that their claims failed to satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement.  The
District Court denied the motion and eventually dismissed the case  [*135]  with
prejudice.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit agreed with
the Martins that the suit failed to satisfy the amount-in-controversy
requirement.  The Tenth Circuit rejected Franklin's contention that punitive
damages and attorney's fees could be aggregated in calculating the amount in
controversy, in part on the basis of  [***552]  decisions issued after the
District Court's remand decision.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to
the District Court with instructions to remand the case to state court.   251
F.3d 1284, 1294 (2001).

Back before the District Court, the Martins moved for attorney's fees under §
1447(c).  The District Court reviewed Franklin's basis for removal and concluded
that, although the Court of Appeals had determined that removal was improper,
Franklin ""had legitimate grounds for believing this case fell within th[e]
Court's jurisdiction."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a.  Because Franklin ""had
objectively reasonable grounds to believe the removal was legally proper,"" the
District Court denied the Martins' request for fees.  Ibid.

The Martins appealed again, arguing that § 1447(c) requires granting attorney's
fees on remand as a matter of course. The Tenth Circuit disagreed, noting that
awarding fees is left to the ""wide discretion"" of the district court, subject to
review only for abuse of discretion.  393 F.3d 1143, 1146 (2004).  Under Tenth
Circuit precedent, the ""'key factor'"" in deciding whether to award fees under §
1447(c) is ""'the propriety of defendant's removal.'"" Ibid. (quoting  Excell,
Inc. v. Sterling Boiler & Mechanical, Inc., 106 F.3d 318, 322 (CA10 1997)). In
calculating the amount in controversy when it removed the case, Franklin had
relied on case law only subsequently held to be unsound, and therefore
Franklin's basis for removal was objectively reasonable.  393 F.3d, at 1148.
Because the District Court had not abused its discretion in denying fees, the
Tenth Circuit affirmed.   Id., at 1151.

[*136]  We granted certiorari,  544 U.S. 998, 125 S. Ct. 1941, 161 L. Ed. 2d 772
(2005), to resolve a conflict among the Circuits concerning when attorney's fees
should be awarded under § 1447(c).  Compare, e.g.,  Hornbuckle v. State Farm
Lloyds, 385 F.3d 538, 541 (CA5 2004) (""Fees should only be awarded if the
removing defendant lacked objectively reasonable grounds to believe the removal
was legally proper"" (internal quotation marks omitted)), with  Sirotzky v. New
York Stock Exchange, 347 F.3d 985, 987 (CA7 2003) (""[P]rovided removal was
improper, the plaintiff is presumptively entitled to an award of fees""), and
Hofler v. Aetna U.S. Healthcare of Cal., Inc., 296 F.3d 764, 770 (CA9 2002)
(affirming fee award even when ""the defendant's position may be fairly
supportable"" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  We hold that, absent unusual
circumstances, attorney's fees should not be awarded when the removing party has
an objectively reasonable basis for removal. We therefore affirm the judgment of
the Tenth Circuit.

II

[***LEdHR1A] [1B] The Martins argue that attorney's fees should be awarded
automatically on [**709]  remand, or that there should at least be a strong
presumption in favor of awarding fees.  [HN2] Section 1447(c), however, provides
that a remand order ""may"" require payment of attorney's fees--not ""shall"" or
""should."" As Chief Justice Rehnquist explained for the Court in  Fogerty v.
Fantasy, Inc., 510 U.S. 517, 533, 114 S. Ct. 1023, 127 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1994),
""[t]he word 'may' clearly connotes discretion.  The automatic awarding of
attorney's fees to the prevailing party would pretermit the exercise of that
discretion."" Congress  [***553]  used the word ""shall"" often enough in § 1447(c)
--as when it specified that removed cases apparently outside federal
jurisdiction ""shall be remanded""--to dissuade us from the conclusion that it
meant ""shall"" when it used ""may"" in authorizing an award of fees.

The Martins are on somewhat stronger ground in pressing for a presumption in
favor of awarding fees. As they explain,  [*137]  we interpreted a statute
authorizing a discretionary award of fees to prevailing plaintiffs in civil
rights cases to nonetheless give rise to such a presumption.   Newman v. Piggie
Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S. Ct. 964, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1263
(1968) (per curiam). But this case is not at all like Piggie Park. In Piggie
Park, we concluded that a prevailing plaintiff in a civil rights suit serves as
a ""'private attorney general,'"" helping to ensure compliance with civil rights
laws and benefiting the public by ""vindicating a policy that Congress considered
of the highest priority."" Ibid. We also later explained that the Piggie Park
standard was appropriate in that case because the civil rights defendant, who is
required to pay the attorney's fees, has violated federal law. See  Flight
Attendants v. Zipes, 491 U.S. 754, 762, 109 S. Ct. 2732, 105 L. Ed. 2d 639
(1989) (""Our cases have emphasized the crucial connection between liability for
violation of federal law and liability for attorney's fees under federal
fee-shifting statutes"").

In this case, plaintiffs do not serve as private attorneys general when they
secure a remand to state court, nor is it reasonable to view the defendants as
violators of federal law. To the contrary, the removal statute grants defendants
a right to a federal forum.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1441 (2000 ed. and Supp. II).  A
remand is necessary if a defendant improperly asserts this right, but
incorrectly invoking a federal right is not comparable to violating substantive
federal law. The reasons for adopting a strong presumption in favor of awarding
fees that were present in Piggie Park are accordingly absent here.  In the
absence of such reasons, we are left with no sound basis for a similar
presumption.  Instead, had Congress intended to award fees as a matter of course
to a party that successfully obtains a remand, we think that ""[s]uch a bold
departure from traditional practice would have surely drawn more explicit
statutory language and legislative comment.""  Fogerty, supra, at 534, 114 S. Ct.
1023, 127 L. Ed. 2d 455.

For its part, Franklin begins by arguing that § 1447(c) provides little guidance
on when fees should be shifted because [*138]  it is not a fee-shifting statute
at all.  According to Franklin, the provision simply grants courts jurisdiction
to award costs and attorney's fees when otherwise warranted, for example when
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 supports awarding fees. Although Franklin is
correct that the predecessor to § 1447(c) was enacted, in part, because courts
would otherwise lack jurisdiction to award costs on remand, see  Mansfield, C. &
L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, 111 U.S. 379, 386-387, 4 S. Ct. 510, 28 L. Ed. 462 (1884),
there is no reason to assume Congress went no further than conferring
jurisdiction when it acted.  Congress could have determined that the [**710]
most efficient way to cure this jurisdictional defect was to create a
substantive basis for ordering costs.  The text supports this view.  If the
statute  [***554]  were strictly jurisdictional, there would be no need to limit
awards to ""just"" costs; any award authorized by other provisions of law would
presumably be ""just."" We therefore give the statute its natural reading:  [HN3]
Section 1447(c) authorizes courts to award costs and fees, but only when such an
award is just.  The question remains how to define that standard.

The Solicitor General would define the standard narrowly, arguing that fees
should be awarded only on a showing that the unsuccessful party's position was
""frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation""--the standard we have adopted
for awarding fees against unsuccessful plaintiffs in civil rights cases, see
Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S. Ct. 694, 54 L. Ed.
2d 648 (1978), and unsuccessful intervenors in such cases, see  Zipes, supra, at
762, 109 S. Ct. 2732, 105 L. Ed. 2d 639.  Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 14-16.  But just as there is no basis for supposing Congress meant to
tilt the exercise of discretion in favor of fee awards under § 1447(c), as there
was in Piggie Park, so too there is no basis here for a strong bias against fee
awards, as there was in Christiansburg Garment and Zipes. The statutory language
and context strike us as more evenly balanced between a pro-award and anti-award
[*139]  position than was the case in either Piggie Park or Christiansburg
Garment and Zipes; we see nothing to persuade us that fees under § 1447(c)
should either usually be granted or usually be denied.

The fact that an award of fees under § 1447(c) is left to the district court's
discretion, with no heavy congressional thumb on either side of the scales, does
not mean that no legal standard governs that discretion.  We have it on good
authority that  [HN4] ""a motion to [a court's] discretion is a motion, not to
its inclination, but to its judgment; and its judgment is to be guided by sound
legal principles.""  United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 30, 35, F. Cas. No. 14692d
(No. 14,692d) (CC Va. 1807) (Marshall, C. J.).  Discretion is not whim, and
limiting discretion according to legal standards helps promote the basic
principle of justice that like cases should be decided alike.  See Friendly,
Indiscretion About Discretion,  31 Emory L. J. 747, 758 (1982).  For these
reasons, we have often limited courts' discretion to award fees despite the
absence of express legislative restrictions.  That is, of course, what we did in
Piggie Park, supra, 390 U.S., at 402, 88 S. Ct. 964, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1263 (A
prevailing plaintiff ""should ordinarily recover an attorney's fee unless special
circumstances would render such an award unjust""),  Christiansburg Garment,
supra, at 422, 98 S. Ct. 694, 54 L. Ed. 2d 648 (""[A] plaintiff should not be
assessed his opponent's attorney's fees unless a court finds that his claim was
frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless""), and  Zipes, 491 U.S., at 761, 109 S.
Ct. 2732, 105 L. Ed. 2d 639 (Attorney's fees should be awarded against
intervenors ""only where the intervenors' action was frivolous, unreasonable, or
without foundation"").

In Zipes, we reaffirmed the principle on which these decisions are based:  [HN5]
""Although the text of the provision does not specify any limits upon the
district courts' discretion to allow or disallow fees, in a system of laws
discretion is rarely without limits.""  Id., at 758, 109 S. Ct. 2732, 105 L. Ed.
2d 639.  Zipes also explains how to discern the limits on a  [***555]  district
court's discretion.  When applying fee-shifting statutes, ""we have found limits
in 'the large objectives'  [*140]  of the relevant Act, which embrace certain
'equitable considerations.'""  Id., at 759, 109 S. Ct. 2732, 105 L. Ed. 2d 639
(citation omitted). *

* In Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U.S. 517, 114 S. Ct. 1023, 127 L. Ed. 2d 455
(1994), we did not identify a standard under which fees should be awarded.  But
that decision did not depart from Zipes because we granted certiorari to decide
only whether the same standard applied to prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing
defendants.  See 510 U.S., at 521, 114 S. Ct. 1023, 127 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1994).
Having decided this question and rejected the claim that fee shifting should be
automatic, we remanded to the Court of Appeals to consider the appropriate test
in the first instance.   Id., at 534-535, 114 S. Ct. 1023, 127 L. Ed. 2d 455.

 [**711]   By enacting the removal statute, Congress granted a right to a
federal forum to a limited class of state-court defendants.  If fee shifting
were automatic, defendants might choose to exercise this right only in cases
where the right to remove was obvious.  See  Christiansburg Garment, supra, at
422, 98 S. Ct. 694, 54 L. Ed. 2d 648 (awarding fees simply because the party did
not prevail ""could discourage all but the most airtight claims, for seldom can a
[party] be sure of ultimate success"").  But there is no reason to suppose
Congress meant to confer a right to remove, while at the same time discouraging
its exercise in all but obvious cases.

Congress, however, would not have enacted § 1447(c) if its only concern were
avoiding deterrence of proper removals. Instead, Congress thought fee shifting
appropriate in some cases.  The process of removing a case to federal court and
then having it remanded back to state court delays resolution of the case,
imposes additional costs on both parties, and wastes judicial resources.
Assessing costs and fees on remand reduces the attractiveness of removal as a
method for delaying litigation and imposing costs on the plaintiff.  The
appropriate test for awarding fees under § 1447(c) should recognize the desire
to deter removals sought for the purpose of prolonging litigation and imposing
costs on the opposing party, while not undermining Congress' basic decision to
afford defendants a right to remove as a general matter, when the statutory
criteria are satisfied.

[***LEdHR1A] [1C]  [***LEdHR2] [2] [*141]  In light of these ""'large
objectives,'""  Zipes, supra, at 759, 109 S. Ct. 2732, 105 L. Ed. 2d 639,  [HN6]
the standard for awarding fees should turn on the reasonableness of the removal.
Absent unusual circumstances, courts may award attorney's fees under § 1447(c)
only where the removing party lacked an objectively reasonable basis for seeking
removal. Conversely, when an objectively reasonable basis exists, fees should be
denied.  See, e.g.,  Hornbuckle, 385 F.3d at 541;  Valdes v. Wal-Mart Stores,
Inc., 199 F.3d 290, 293 (CA5 2000).  In applying this rule, district courts
retain discretion to consider whether unusual circumstances warrant a departure
from the rule in a given case.  For instance, a plaintiff's delay in seeking
remand or failure to disclose facts necessary to determine jurisdiction may
affect the decision to award attorney's fees.  When a court exercises its
discretion in this manner, however, its reasons for departing from the general
rule should be ""faithful to the purposes"" of awarding fees under § 1447(c).
Fogerty, 510 U.S., at 534, n. 19, 114 S. Ct. 1023, 127 L. Ed. 2d 455; see also
Milwaukee v. Cement Div., National Gypsum Co., 515 U.S. 189, 196, n. 8,
[***556]  115 S. Ct. 2091, 132 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1995) (""[A]s is always the case
when an issue is committed to judicial discretion, the judge's decision must be
supported by a circumstance that has relevance to the issue at hand"").

The District Court denied the Martins' request for attorney's fees because
Franklin had an objectively reasonable basis for [**712]  removing this case to
federal court.  The Court of Appeals considered it a ""close question,""  393
F.3d, at 1148, but agreed that the grounds for removal were reasonable.  Because
the Martins do not dispute the reasonableness of Franklin's removal arguments,
we need not review the lower courts' decision on this point.  The judgment of
the Court of Appeals is therefore affirmed.

It is so ordered.

the Court.

As Enron Corporation's financial difficulties became public in 2001, petitioner
Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's auditor, instructed its employees to destroy
documents pursuant to its document retention policy. A jury found that this
action made petitioner guilty of violating 18 U.S.C. §§ 1512(b)(2)(A) and (B).
These sections make it a crime to ""knowingly use intimidation or physical force,
threaten, or corruptly persuade another person . . . with intent to . . . cause""
that person to ""withhold"" documents from, or ""alter"" documents for use in, an
""official proceeding."" 1 The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. We
hold that the jury  [**2132]  instructions failed to convey properly the
elements of a ""corrup[t] persua[sion]"" conviction under § 1512(b), and therefore
reverse.

Enron Corporation, during the 1990's, switched its business from operation of
natural gas pipelines to an energy conglomerate, a move that was accompanied by
aggressive accounting practices and rapid growth. Petitioner audited Enron's
publicly filed financial statements and provided internal audit and consulting
services to it. Petitioner's ""engagement  [*699]  team"" for Enron was headed by
David Duncan. Beginning in 2000, Enron's financial performance began  [***1014]
to suffer, and, as 2001 wore on, worsened. 2 On August 14, 2001, Jeffrey
Skilling, Enron's Chief Executive Officer (CEO), unexpectedly resigned. Within
days, Sherron Watkins, a senior accountant at Enron, warned Kenneth Lay, Enron's
newly reappointed CEO, that Enron could ""implode in a wave of accounting
scandals."" Brief for United States 2. She likewise informed Duncan and Michael
Odom, one of petitioner's partners who had supervisory responsibility over
Duncan, of the looming problems.

2 During this time, petitioner faced problems of its own. In June 2001,
petitioner entered into a settlement agreement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) related to its audit work of Waste Management, Inc. As part of
the settlement, petitioner paid a massive fine. It also was censured and
enjoined from committing further violations of the securities laws. In July
2001, the SEC filed an amended complaint alleging improprieties by Sunbeam
Corporation, and petitioner's lead partner on the Sunbeam audit was named.

On August 28, an article in the Wall Street Journal suggested improprieties at
Enron, and the SEC opened an informal investigation. By early September,
petitioner had formed an Enron ""crisis-response"" team, which included Nancy
Temple, an in-house counsel. 3 On October 8, petitioner retained outside counsel
to represent it in any litigation that might arise from the Enron matter. The
next day, Temple discussed Enron with other in-house counsel. Her notes from
that meeting reflect that ""some SEC investigation"" is ""highly probable."" Id., at

3 A key accounting problem involved Enron's use of ""Raptors,"" which were special
purpose entities used to engage in ""off-balance-sheet"" activities. Petitioner's
engagement team had allowed Enron to ""aggregate"" the Raptors for accounting
purposes so that they reflected a positive return. This was, in the words of
petitioner's experts, a ""black-and-white"" violation of Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles. Brief for United States 2.

On October 10, Odom spoke at a general training meeting attended by 89
employees, including 10 from the Enron engagement [*700]  team. Odom urged
everyone to comply with the firm's document retention policy. 4 He added: ""'If
it's destroyed in the course of [the] normal policy and litigation is filed the
next day, that's great . . . . We've followed our own policy, and whatever there
was that might have been of  [**2133] interest to somebody is gone and
irretrievable.'""  374 F.3d 281, 286 (CA5 2004). On October 12, Temple entered
the Enron matter into her computer, designating the ""Type of Potential Claim"" as
""Professional Practice -- Government/Regulatory Investigation."" App. JA-127.
Temple also e-mailed Odom, suggesting that he ""'remind the engagement team of
our documentation and retention policy.'"" Brief for United States 6.

provided that, if petitioner is ""advised of litigation or subpoenas regarding a
particular engagement, the related information should not be destroyed. See

 On October 16, Enron announced its third quarter results. That release
disclosed a $ 1.01 billion charge to  [***1015]  earnings. 5 The following day,
the SEC notified Enron by letter that it had opened an investigation in August
and requested certain information and documents. On October 19, Enron forwarded

an e-mail to Duncan that ""suggested deleting some language that might suggest we
have concluded the release is misleading."" App. JA-95.

 [*701]  On the same day, Temple also sent an e-mail to a member of petitioner's
internal team of accounting experts and attached a copy of the document policy.
On October 20, the Enron crisis-response team held a conference call, during
which Temple instructed everyone to ""make sure to follow the [document] policy.""
Brief for United States 7 (brackets in original). On October 23, Enron CEO Lay
declined to answer questions during a call with analysts because of ""potential
lawsuits, as well as the SEC inquiry."" Ibid. After the call, Duncan met with
other Andersen partners on the Enron engagement team and told them that they
should ensure team members were complying with the document policy. Another
meeting for all team members followed, during which Duncan distributed the
policy and told everyone to comply. These, and other smaller meetings, were
followed by substantial destruction of paper and electronic documents.

On October 26, one of petitioner's senior partners circulated a New York Times
article discussing the SEC's response to Enron. His e-mail commented that ""the
problems are just beginning and we will be in the cross hairs. The marketplace
is going to keep the pressure on this and is going to force the SEC to be
tough."" Id., at 8. On October 30, the SEC opened a formal investigation and sent
Enron a letter that requested accounting documents.

Throughout this time period, the document destruction continued, despite
reservations by some of petitioner's managers. 6 On November 8, Enron announced
that it would  [*702]  issue a comprehensive restatement of its earnings and
assets. Also on November 8, the SEC served Enron and petitioner with subpoenas
for records. On November 9, Duncan's secretary sent an e-mail that stated: ""Per
Dave -- No more shredding . . . . We have been officially served for our
documents."" Id., at 10. Enron filed for bankruptcy less than a month later.

 [**2134]   In March 2002, petitioner was indicted in the Southern District of
Texas on one count of violating §§ 1512(b)(2)(A) and (B). The indictment alleged
that, between October 10 and November 9, 2001, petitioner ""did knowingly,
intentionally and corruptly persuade . . . other persons, to wit: [petitioner's]
employees, with intent to cause"" them to withhold documents from, and alter
documents for use in, ""official proceedings,  [***1016]  namely: regulatory and
criminal proceedings and investigations."" App. JA-139. A jury trial followed.
When the case went to the jury, that body deliberated for seven days and then
declared that it was deadlocked. The District Court delivered an ""Allen charge,""
Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492, 41 L. Ed. 528, 17 S. Ct. 154 (1896), and,
after three more days of deliberation, the jury returned a guilty verdict. The
District Court denied petitioner's motion for a judgment of acquittal.

The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.  374 F.3d at 284. It held
that the jury instructions properly conveyed the meaning of ""corruptly
persuades"" and ""official proceeding""; that the jury need not find any
consciousness of wrongdoing; and that there was no reversible error. Because of
a split of authority regarding the meaning of § 1512(b), we granted certiorari.

 [*703]   [HN1] Chapter 73 of Title 18 of the United States Code provides
criminal sanctions for those who obstruct justice. Sections 1512(b)(2)(A) and
(B), part of the witness tampering provisions, provide in relevant part:

[HN2] ""Whoever knowingly uses intimidation or physical force, threatens, or
corruptly persuades another person, or attempts to do so, or engages in
misleading conduct toward another person, with intent to . . . cause or induce
any person to . . . withhold testimony, or withhold a record, document, or other
object, from an official proceeding [or] alter, destroy, mutilate, or conceal an
object with intent to impair the object's integrity or availability for use in
an official proceeding . . . shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not
more than ten years, or both.""

In this case, our attention is focused on what it means to ""knowingly . . .
corruptly persuade"" another person ""with intent to . . . cause"" that person to
""withhold"" documents from, or ""alter"" documents for use in, an ""official
proceeding.""

[HN3] ""We have traditionally exercised restraint in assessing the reach of a
federal criminal statute, both out of deference to the prerogatives of Congress,
Dowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207, 87 L. Ed. 2d 152, 105 S. Ct. 3127 (1985)
, and out of concern that 'a fair warning should be given to the world in
language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if
a certain line is passed,'  McBoyle v. United States, 283 U.S. 25, 27, 75 L. Ed.

Such restraint is particularly appropriate here, where the act underlying the
conviction -- ""persuasion"" -- is by itself innocuous. Indeed, ""persuading"" a
person ""with intent to . . . cause"" that person to ""withhold"" testimony or
documents from a Government proceeding or Government official  [*704]  is not
inherently malign. 8 Consider,  [**2135]  for instance,  a mother who suggests
to her son that he invoke his right against compelled  [***1017]
self-incrimination, see U.S. Const., Amdt. 5, or a wife who persuades her
husband not to disclose marital confidences, see  Trammel v. United States, 445

who intend to prevent ""the communication to a law enforcement officer or judge
of the United States of information"" relating to a federal crime.

Nor is it necessarily corrupt for an attorney to ""persuade"" a client ""with
intent to . . . cause"" that client to ""withhold"" documents from the Government.
In  Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 66 L. Ed. 2d 584, 101 S. Ct. 677
(1981), for example, we held that Upjohn was justified in withholding documents
that were covered by the attorney-client privilege from the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS). See  id., at 395, 66 L. Ed. 2d 584, 101 S. Ct. 677. No one would
suggest that an attorney who ""persuaded"" Upjohn to take that step acted
wrongfully, even though he surely intended that his client keep those documents
out of the IRS' hands.

""Document retention policies,"" which are created in part to keep certain
information from getting into the hands of others, including the Government, are
common in business. See generally Chase, To Shred or Not to Shred: Document
Retention Policies and Federal Obstruction of Justice Statutes, 8 Ford. J. Corp.
& Fin. L. 721 (2003). It is, of course, not wrongful for a manager to instruct
his employees to comply with a valid document retention policy under ordinary
circumstances.

Acknowledging this point, the parties have largely focused their attention on
the word ""corruptly"" as the key to what may or may not lawfully be done in the
situation presented here.  [HN5] Section 1512(b) punishes not just ""corruptly
persuading"" another, but ""knowingly . . . corruptly persuading"" another.
(Emphasis added.) The Government suggests that ""knowingly"" does not modify
""corruptly persuades,""  [*705]  but that is not how the statute most naturally
reads. It provides the mens rea -- ""knowingly"" -- and then a list of acts --
""uses intimidation or physical force, threatens, or corruptly persuades."" We
have recognized with regard to similar statutory language that the mens rea at
least applies to the acts that immediately follow, if not to other elements down
the statutory chain. See  United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. 64,
68, 130 L. Ed. 2d 372, 115 S. Ct. 464 (1994) (recognizing that the ""most natural
grammatical reading"" of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2252(a)(1) and (2) ""suggests that the term
'knowingly' modifies only the surrounding verbs: transports, ships, receives,
distributes, or reproduces""); see also  Liparota v. United States, 471 U.S. 419,
85 L. Ed. 2d 434, 105 S. Ct. 2084 (1985). The Government suggests that it is
""questionable whether Congress would employ such an inelegant formulation as
'knowingly . . . corruptly persuades.'"" Brief for United States 35, n. 18. Long
experience has not taught us to share the Government's doubts on this score, and
we must simply interpret the statute as written.

[***1018]  The parties have not pointed us to another interpretation of
""knowingly . . . corruptly"" to guide us here. 9 In any event, the natural
meaning of these terms provides a clear answer. See  Bailey v. United States,
516 U.S. 137, 144-145, 133 L. Ed. 2d 472, 116 S. Ct. 501 (1995).  [HN6]
""Knowledge"" and ""knowingly"" are normally associated  [**2136]  with awareness,
understanding, or consciousness. See Black's Law Dictionary 888 (8th ed. 2004)
(hereinafter Black's); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1252-1253
(1993) (hereinafter Webster's 3d); American Heritage Dictionary of the English
Language 725 (1981) (hereinafter Am. Hert.). ""Corrupt"" and ""corruptly"" are
normally associated with wrongful, immoral, depraved, or evil. See Black's 371;
Webster's 3d 512; Am. Hert. 299-300. Joining these meanings together here makes
sense both linguistically  [*706]  and in the statutory scheme. Only persons
conscious of wrongdoing can be said to ""knowingly . . . corruptly persuade."" And
limiting criminality to persuaders conscious of their wrongdoing sensibly allows
§ 1512(b) to reach only those with the level of ""culpability . . . we usually
require in order to impose criminal liability.""  United States v. Aguilar, 515
U.S., at 602, 132 L. Ed. 2d 520, 115 S. Ct. 2357; see also  Liparota v. United
States, supra, at 426, 85 L. Ed. 2d 434, 105 S. Ct. 2084.

9 The parties have pointed us to two other obstruction provisions, 18 U.S.C. §§
1503 and 1505, which contain the word ""corruptly."" But these provisions lack the
modifier ""knowingly,"" making any analogy inexact.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 The outer limits of this element need not be explored here because the jury
instructions at issue simply failed to convey the requisite consciousness of
wrongdoing. Indeed, it is striking how little culpability the instructions
required. For example, the jury was told that, ""even if [petitioner] honestly
and sincerely believed that its conduct was lawful, you may find [petitioner]
guilty."" App. JA-213. The instructions also diluted the meaning of ""corruptly""
so that it covered innocent conduct. Id., at JA-212.

The parties vigorously disputed how the jury would be instructed on ""corruptly.""
The District Court based its instruction on the definition of that term found in
the Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction for § 1503. This pattern instruction
defined ""corruptly"" as ""'knowingly and dishonestly, with the specific intent to
subvert or undermine the integrity'"" of a proceeding. Brief for Petitioner 3, n.
3 (emphasis deleted). The Government, however, insisted on excluding
""dishonestly"" and adding the term ""impede"" to the phrase ""subvert or undermine.""
Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). The District Court agreed over
petitioner's objections, and the jury was told to convict if it found petitioner
intended to ""subvert, undermine, or impede"" governmental factfinding by
suggesting to its employees that they enforce the document retention policy.
App. JA-212.

These changes were significant. No longer was any type of ""dishonest[y]""
necessary to a finding of guilt, and it was enough for petitioner to have simply
""impede[d]"" the Government's factfinding ability. As the Government conceded
[*707]  at oral argument,  [HN7] ""'[i]mpede'"" has broader connotations than
""'subvert'"" or even ""'[u]ndermine,'"" see Tr. of Oral Arg. 38, and many of these
connotations do not incorporate any ""corrupt[ness]"" at  [***1019]  all. The
dictionary defines ""impede"" as ""to interfere with or get in the way of the
progress of"" or ""hold up"" or ""detract from."" Webster's 3d 1132. By definition,
anyone who innocently persuades another to withhold information from the
Government ""get[s] in the way of the progress of"" the Government. With regard to
such innocent conduct, the ""corruptly"" instructions did no limiting work
whatsoever.

The instructions also were infirm for another reason. They led the jury to
believe that it did not have to find any nexus between the ""persuasion"" to
destroy documents and any particular proceeding. 10 In resisting any type of
nexus  [**2137]  element, the Government relies heavily on  [HN8] § 1512(e)(1),
which states that an official proceeding ""need not be pending or about to be
instituted at the time of the offense."" It is, however, one thing to say that a
proceeding ""need not be pending or about to be instituted at the time of the
offense,"" and  [*708]  quite another to say a proceeding need not even be
foreseen. A ""knowingly . . . corrupt persauder"" cannot be someone who persuades
others to shred documents under a document retention policy when he does not
have in contemplation any particular official proceeding in which those
documents might be material.

10 We disagree with the Government's suggestion that petitioner's ""nexus""
argument is not preserved or that it is only subject to plain-error review for
failure to comply with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 30(d). Petitioner
plainly argued for, and objected to the instructions' lack of, a nexus
requirement. See, e.g., Record 425 (arguing for a ""nexus"" and explaining that
""it is insufficient for the government to show that the defendant intended to
affect some hypothetical future federal proceeding""); Id., at 931-932, 938; Tr.
4339-4345 (May 25, 2002). In so doing, it reasonably relied on language in
United States v. Shively, 927 F.2d 804, 812-813 (CA5 1991). Although the
instruction petitioner proposed, based on Shively, does not mirror the nexus
requirement it now proposes, its actions were sufficient to satisfy Rule 30(d).
This argument also was preserved in the Court of Appeals, which recognized that
petitioner was challenging ""the concreteness of the defendant's expectation[s]
of a proceeding.""  374 F.3d 281, 298 (CA5 2004); see  United States v. Williams,
504 U.S. 36, 41-42, 118 L. Ed. 2d 352, 112 S. Ct. 1735 (1992). However, the
Court of Appeals did not address, and petitioner did not preserve, its argument
that informal inquiries are not covered by the statute. See ibid.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 We faced a similar situation in  Aguilar, supra, 515 U.S. 593, 132 L. Ed. 2d
520, 115 S. Ct. 2357 Respondent Aguilar lied to a Federal Bureau of
Investigation agent in the course of an investigation and was convicted of
""'corruptly endeavoring to influence, obstruct, and impede [a] . . . grand jury
investigation'"" under § 1503.  515 U.S., at 599, 132 L. Ed. 2d 520, 115 S. Ct.
2357. All the Government had shown was that Aguilar had uttered false statements
to an investigating agent ""who might or might not testify before a grand jury.""
Id., at 600, 132 L. Ed. 2d 520, 115 S. Ct. 2357. We held that § 1503 required
something more -- specifically, a ""nexus"" between the obstructive act and the
proceeding.  Id., at 599-600, 132 L. Ed. 2d 520, 115 S. Ct. 2357. ""If the
defendant lacks knowledge that his actions are likely to affect the judicial
proceeding,"" we explained, ""he lacks the requisite intent to obstruct.""  Id., at
599, 132 L. Ed. 2d 520, 115 S. Ct. 2357.

For these reasons, the jury instructions here were flawed in important respects.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

"           FRANCIS A. ORFF, et al., Petitioners v. UNITED STATES et al.",545 U.S. 596,"

 [*597]  [**2607]   Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.

[***LEdHR1A]  Petitioners are individual farmers and farming entities in
California who purchase water from respondent Westlands [**2608]  Water District
(Westlands or District).  Westlands receives its water from the United States
Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau)  [*598]  under a 1963 contract between Westlands
and the Bureau.  Petitioners contend that the Bureau breached the contract in
1993 when it reduced the water supply to Westlands.  Although petitioners are
not parties to the contract, they claim that they are entitled to enforce it as
intended third-party beneficiaries; that the United States waived its sovereign
immunity from suits for breach of contract in a provision of the Reclamation
Reform Act of 1982, § 221, 96 Stat. 1271, 43 U.S.C. § 390uu; and hence that they
may sue the United States in federal district court for breach of the 1963
contract.  We conclude that, in enacting § 390uu, Congress did not consent to
petitioners' suit.

I

The Reclamation Act of 1902 set in motion a massive program to provide federal
financing, construction, and operation of water storage and distribution
projects to reclaim arid lands in many Western States.  California v. United
States, 438 U.S. 645, 650, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1018, 98 S. Ct. 2985 (1978).  The
California Central Valley Project (CVP), a system of dams, reservoirs, levees,
canals, pumping stations, hydropower plants, and other infrastructure,
distributes water throughout California's vast Central Valley.  United States v.
Gerlach Live Stock Co., 339 U.S. 725, 733, 94 L. Ed. 1231, 70 S. Ct. 955, 116
Ct. Cl. 895 (1950).

The Bureau, located in the Department of the Interior, administers the CVP.  In
accordance with its standard practice for federal reclamation projects, the
Bureau holds permits to appropriate water from the relevant state agency, here
the California  [***548]  State Water Resources Control Board.  See California,
supra, at 652, and n 7, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1018, 98 S. Ct. 2985.  The Bureau
distributes the water in accordance with its statutory and contractual
obligations.  It contracts with state irrigation districts to deliver water and
to receive reimbursement for the costs of constructing, operating, and
maintaining the works.

In 1963, the United States agreed to a 40-year water service contract with
Westlands, a political subdivision of the  [*599]  State of California.  The
1963 contract provided, among other things, that the United States would furnish
to the District specified annual quantities of water, App. 34-36, and that the
District would accept and pay for the water at a maximum rate of $8 per
acre-foot, id., at 38.  Since 1978, the contract has generated extensive
litigation.  See Barcellos & Wolfsen, Inc. v. Westlands Water Dist., 899 F.2d
814, 817 (CA9 1990); O'Neill v. United States, 50 F.3d 677, 681 (CA9 1995);  358
F.3d 1137, 1141 (CA9 2004) (case below).  In 1982, Congress enacted the
Reclamation Reform Act, which included 43 U.S.C. § 390uu, the waiver of
sovereign immunity at issue here.

The present case arose from water delivery reductions in the early 1990's.
Those reductions stemmed from environmental obligations imposed on the Bureau by
the 1992 enactment of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA), 106
Stat. 4706.  The CVPIA directed the Secretary of the Interior to ""operate the
[CVP] to meet all obligations under . . . the Federal Endangered Species Act""
(ESA), § 3406(b), and to dedicate annually a certain amount of CVP water to
implement fish, wildlife, and habitat restoration, § 3406(b)(2).  In the early
1990's, the National Marine Fisheries Service listed the Sacramento River
winter-run chinook salmon as a threatened species under the ESA, see 55 Fed.
Reg. 46523 (1990); 50 CFR § 227.4(e) (1991); and, in 1993, the United States
Fish and Wildlife Service [**2609]  listed the delta smelt as a threatened
species, see 58 Fed. Reg. 12854-12855; 50 CFR § 17.11.  The Bureau concluded
that pumps used to deliver water south of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta could
harm these species. Brief for United States 10-11, and n 7.  To avert possible
harm to these species and other wildlife, the Bureau concluded that it needed to
reduce the water delivery. In the 1993-1994 water year, the Bureau reduced by 50
percent the contractual delivery of CVP water to water districts south of the
Delta, including Westlands.  Id., at 10; see also O'Neill, supra, at 681.

[*600]  In 1993, Westlands and several other water districts challenged the
Bureau's 50-percent delivery reduction under the Administrative Procedure Act,
the ESA, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and the Due Process and
Takings Clauses of the Fifth Amendment.  Westlands Water Dist. v. United States,
Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, 850 F. Supp. 1388, 1394-1395 (ED
Cal. 1994).  Petitioner landowners and water users intervened as plaintiffs.
Respondent Natural Resources Defense Council and other fishing and conservation
organizations intervened as defendants.  Id., at 1394.  Ultimately, following
negotiations among the State of California, the Federal Government, and urban,
agricultural,  and environmental interests, the water districts and all parties
except petitioners  [***549]  stipulated to the dismissal of the districts'
complaint.  358 F.3d at 1142; App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a; Brief for United
States 11. 1

Petitioners pressed forward with numerous claims.  The District Court dismissed
some of them and granted summary judgment for the Government on others, see 358
F.3d at 1142, leaving only the claim at issue here: that the United States had
breached the 1963 contract by reducing the delivery of water and was liable for
money damages. Petitioners contended that the United States had waived its
sovereign immunity from their suit in the Reclamation Reform Act, 43 U.S.C. §
390uu.  The District Court initially held that petitioners were intended
third-party beneficiaries and that the language of § 390uu was broad enough to
allow their suit, App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a, but on reconsideration changed its
view.  It held that, in light of intervening Circuit authority, Klamath Water
Users Protective Ass'n v. Patterson, 204 F.3d 1206 (CA9 1999), petitioners were
neither contracting parties nor intended third-party beneficiaries of the 1963
contract, and therefore could not benefit from § 390uu's waiver.  App. to Pet.
for Cert. 27a-34a.

[*601]  The Court of Appeals affirmed in relevant part.  It agreed with the
District Court's reading of the 1963 contract and § 390uu in light of Klamath .
358 F.3d at 1144-1147.  The Court of Appeals noted that its decision might be at
odds with H. F. Allen Orchards v. United States, 749 F.2d 1571 (CA Fed. 1984),
which had reached the opposite conclusion with respect to farmers who belonged
to an irrigation district in Washington.  358 F.3d at 1147, n. 5.  We granted
certiorari.  543 U.S. 924, 160 L. Ed. 2d 221, 125 S. Ct. 309 (2004).

II

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR2] [2] This dispute centers on § 390uu, which waives the
United States' sovereign immunity for certain purposes.  Section 390uu provides:



      [HN1] ""Consent is given to join the United States as a necessary
     party defendant in any suit to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or
     decree the contractual rights of a contracting entity and the United
     States [**2610]  regarding any contract executed pursuant to Federal
     reclamation law.  The United States, when a party to any suit, shall
     be deemed to have waived any right to plead that it is not amenable
     thereto by reason of its sovereignty, and shall be subject to
     judgments, orders, and decrees of the court having jurisdiction, and
     may obtain review thereof, in the same manner and to the same extent
     as a private individual under like circumstances.  Any suit pursuant
     to this section may be brought in any United States district court in
     the State in which the land involved is situated.""



Petitioners contend that they are intended third-party beneficiaries of the 1963
contract and therefore entitled to enforce the contract.  Hence, they claim,
their suit is one ""to adjudicate . . . the contractual rights of a contracting
entity and the United States"" within the meaning of § 390uu.  This argument
founders on the principle that  [HN2] a waiver of sovereign  [*602]  immunity
must be strictly construed in favor of the sovereign.  See,  [***550]  e.g.,
Department of Army v. Blue Fox, Inc., 525 U.S. 255, 261, 142 L. Ed. 2d 718, 119
S. Ct. 687 (1999); Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, 192, 135 L. Ed. 2d 486, 116 S.
Ct. 2092 (1996).  Construing § 390uu in light of this principle, we find it
insufficient to waive sovereign immunity.

[HN3]  [***LEdHR1A] Section 390uu grants consent ""to join the United States as a
necessary party defendant in any suit to adjudicate"" certain rights under a
federal reclamation contract.  (Emphasis added.) This language is best
interpreted to grant consent to join the United States in an action between
other parties--for example, two water districts, or a water district and its
members--when the action requires construction of a reclamation contract and
joinder of the United States is necessary.  It does not permit a plaintiff to
sue the United States alone.

[***LEdHR1A]   [***LEdHR3] [3] Section 390uu's use of the words ""necessary
party"" supports this interpretation.  Before 1966, the term ""necessary""
described the class of parties now called ""Persons to be Joined if Feasible""
under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19(a).  See Provident Tradesmens Bank &
Trust Co. v. Patterson, 390 U.S. 102, 116-118, 19 L. Ed. 2d 936, 88 S. Ct. 733,
and n. 12 (1968) (recounting terminology change).   [HN4] Rule 19(a) requires a
court to order joinder of a party if


     ""(1) in the person's absence complete relief cannot be accorded among
     those already parties, or (2) the person claims an interest relating
     to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition
     of the action in the person's absence may (i) as a practical matter
     impair or impede the person's ability to protect that interest or (ii)
     leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk
     of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations
     by reason of the claimed interest.""



Though the Rule no longer describes such parties as ""necessary,"" ""necessary
party"" is a term of art whose meaning parallels  [*603]  Rule 19(a)'s
requirements.  See Black's Law Dictionary 928 (5th ed. 1979) (defining
""necessary parties"" as ""those persons who must be joined in an action because,
inter alia, complete relief cannot be given to those already parties without
their joinder,"" and citing Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(a)).

[***LEdHR1A]  The phrase ""join . . . as a necessary party defendant"" in § 390uu
thus calls to mind Rule 19(a)'s requirements.  We need not decide here whether
the phrase limits the waiver of sovereign immunity to cases in which the United
States could be joined under Rule 19(a).  Regardless, the traditional concept of
joinder of a necessary [**2611]  party supports interpreting § 390uu to permit
joinder of the United States in an action rather than initiation of a suit
solely against it.

Our conclusion draws force from the contrast between § 390uu's language, which
speaks in terms of joinder, and the broader phrasing of statutes that waive
immunity from suits against the United States alone.  For example, the Tucker
Act grants the United States Court of Federal Claims ""jurisdiction to render
judgment upon any claim against the United States founded . . . upon any express
or implied contract with the United States."" 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1). 2  [***551]
The Little Tucker Act grants district courts original jurisdiction, concurrent
with the Court of Federal Claims, over ""[a]ny . . . civil action or claim
against the United States, not exceeding $10,000 in amount, founded . . . upon
any express or implied contract with the United States."" § 1346(a)(2).  The
contrast between 43 U.S.C. § 390uu and the broader language of these statutes
confirms that our construction ascribes the proper meaning to the limiting
phrase ""join . . . as a necessary party defendant"" in § 390uu.

 Petitioners' suit cannot proceed under our interpretation of § 390uu.  For
purposes of that provision, petitioners sought to sue the United States alone:
They named as defendants  [*604]  the United States itself, as well as various
federal entities and officials they viewed as responsible for the water delivery
reduction (for example, the Bureau, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the
Secretary of the Interior).  Petitioners' suit, brought solely against the
United States and its agents, is not an attempt to ""join the United States as a
necessary party defendant."" § 390uu (emphasis added). 3

3 We need not reach the contentions, advanced by respondents, that § 390uu
neither unequivocally grants consent to a money damages remedy, Brief for United
States 23-25; Brief for Natural Resources Defense Council et al. 20-21, nor
unequivocally grants consent to suit by noncontracting entities, id., at 22-23,
and n 8; Brief for Westlands Water District 44-46.  As explained above, we find
§ 390uu otherwise insufficiently clear to grant consent to petitioners' suit.

     * * *



We hold that § 390uu does not waive immunity from petitioners' suit:  [HN5] The
statute does not waive immunity from suits directly against the United States,
as opposed to joinder of the United States as a necessary party defendant to
permit a complete adjudication of rights under a reclamation contract.  We
therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

CONCUR

 [**510]  JUSTICE STEVENS, respecting the denial of certiorari.

On several occasions in the past, I have found it appropriate to emphasize the
fact that a denial of certiorari is not a ruling on the merits of any issue
raised by the petition. 1 This is a case that raises significant constitutional
questions regarding the President's intrasession appointment of Judge William H.
Pryor, Jr., to the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which occurred
[*943]  during the 11-day President's Day break between February 12 and 23,
2004. 2 However, this is also a case in which,  [***2]  as the Government has
urged in its response, there are valid prudential concerns supporting the
decision to deny certiorari.  Those considerations include the fact that the
particular type of appointment in question is ""the first such appointment of an
Article III judge"" in nearly a half century, 3 that petitioners seek review of
an interlocutory order, 4 and the fact that the Court of Appeals did ""not view
the question of the constitutionality of Judge Pryor's appointment  [**511]  as
affecting jurisdiction."" 5 Moreover, the court's citation to our decision in
Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868, 115 L. Ed. 2d 764, 111 S. Ct. 2631 (1991)
, suggests that it viewed Judge Pryor's participation in the decision of
otherwise properly constituted three-judge panels as irrelevant to those panels'
power to enter a valid judgment. See  387 F.3d 1220, 1222, n.1 (CA11 2004) (en
banc).

I agree that there are legitimate prudential reasons for denying certiorari in
this somewhat unusual case. That being said, it would be a mistake to assume
that our disposition of this petition constitutes a decision on the merits of
whether the President has the constitutional authority to fill future Article
III vacancies, such as vacancies on this Court, with appointments made absent
consent of the Senate during short intrasession ""recesses.""

"                DORA B. SCHRIRO, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF                 CORRECTIONS, Petitioner v. ROBERT DOUGLAS SMITH",546 U.S. 6,"

 [***8]  [*6]  [**8]    Per Curiam.

In 1982, an Arizona jury convicted respondent Robert Douglas Smith of
first-degree murder, kidnaping, and sexual assault.  He was sentenced to death.
The convictions and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, and Smith's state
petitions for postconviction relief proved unsuccessful.  Smith then filed a
petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the
District of Arizona.  In none of these proceedings did Smith argue that he was
mentally retarded or that his mental retardation made him ineligible for the
death penalty.  Smith had, however, presented  [*7]  evidence in mitigation
during the sentencing phase of his trial showing that he had low intelligence.

The District Court denied Smith's petition for habeas corpus in 1996.  Following
several rounds of appeals, remands, and petitions for certiorari to this Court
(including one successful petition by the State, see  Stewart v. Smith, 536 U.S.
856, 122 S. Ct. 2578, 153 L. Ed. 2d 762 (2002) (per curiam)), and after we had
issued our decision in  Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 122 S. Ct. 2242, 153
L. Ed. 2d 335 (2002), the case returned to the Ninth Circuit.  Shortly
thereafter, Smith asserted in briefing that he is mentally retarded and cannot,
under Atkins, be executed.  [**9]  The Ninth Circuit ordered suspension of all
federal habeas proceedings and directed Smith to ""institute proceedings in the
proper trial court of Arizona to determine whether the state is prohibited from
executing [Smith] in accordance with Atkins."" App. to Pet. for Cert. A-2.  The
court further ordered that the issue whether Smith is mentally retarded must ""be
determined . . . by a jury trial unless the right to a jury is waived by the
parties."" Ibid.

The State's petition for certiorari is granted, * the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded.  The Ninth Circuit erred in
commanding the Arizona courts to conduct a jury trial to resolve Smith's mental
retardation claim.  Atkins stated in clear terms that  [HN1] ""'we leave to the
State[s] the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional
restriction upon [their] execution of sentences.'""  536 U.S., at 317, 122 S. Ct.
[***9]  2578, 153 L. Ed. 2d 762 (quoting  Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 399, 106
S. Ct. 2595, 416-417, 91 L. Ed. 2d 335 (1986); modifications in original).
States, including Arizona, have responded to that challenge by adopting their
own measures for adjudicating claims of mental retardation. While those measures
might, in their application, be subject to constitutional challenge, Arizona had
not even had a chance to apply its chosen procedures  [*8]  when the Ninth
Circuit preemptively imposed its jury trial condition.

Because the Court of Appeals exceeded its limited authority on habeas review,
the judgment below is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

 [*1302]   [**1624]  Justice Kennedy, Circuit Justice.

[***LEdHR1A] [1A] This is an application for a stay of orders of the Seventh
Judicial Circuit Court of St. Johns County, Florida.  The applicant, First Coast
News, alleges the orders restrict its publication of the contents of transcripts
of grand jury proceedings held in a criminal prosecution for murder.  First
Coast News is a local television network that has been covering the prosecution.
For reasons to be discussed, the application is denied.

I

Two orders are at issue.  The first was entered July 30, 2004.  It states the
court had discovered that copies of the transcript of certain testimony before
the [**1625]  grand jury had been released to members of the press as well as to
investigators from the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office, in apparent violation
of Fla. Stat.  § 905.27 (2003).   [HN1] Section 905.27 generally prohibits the
disclosure of grand jury testimony, with certain exceptions.  As relevant here,
the order directs that ""[n]o party shall further disclose the contents of the
transcript of testimony before the Grand Jury to any person not authorized by F.
S. 905.27(2)."" Order Sealing Transcript, etc., in No. 04001748 CF (Fla Cir Ct,
July 30, 2004), p 2, App. in Support of Stay Application, Tab 5 (hereinafter
July 30 Order).  It further provides that ""[a]ll persons who have  [***593]
obtained a copy of the transcript are placed on notice that any broadcast,
publication, disclosure or communication of the contents of this transcript is a
violation of F. S. 905.27, punishable as a misdemeanor in addition to
constituting grounds for Criminal Contempt of Court."" Ibid. Applicant alleges it
received a copy of this order from the court.  See Application to Stay Prior
Restraint Order 3.

Applicant moved to intervene and set aside the July 30 Order as an
unconstitutional prior restraint. This appears to have prompted the trial court
to enter a second order.   [*1303]  The order, entered August 9, 2004, notes
that ""[a]t no point in the Court's [July 30 Order] is [applicant] precluded or
restrained from publishing matters which are public record, nor is [applicant]
enjoined or restrained from broadcasting matters in this case.  The [July 30
Order] clearly provides that the parties to this action are enjoined from
further disclosing the contents of the transcript of testimony before the Grand
Jury to any person not authorized by F. S. 905.27(2).  The parties to this
action are the State of Florida . . . and defense counsel."" Order on Motion to
Intervene, etc., in No. CF04-1478 (Fla Cir Ct, Aug. 9, 2004), pp 1-2, App. in
Support of Stay Application, Tab 10 (hereinafter Aug. 9 Order).  The court
declined to hold a hearing on applicant's motion because ""the Court's order does
not enjoin the [applicant] from publishing or broadcasting materials that it
wishes to publish or broadcast, but rather solely points out that so to do might
constitute further violations of criminal law."" Id., at 2.  The court denied
applicant's motion to intervene and its motion to set aside the July 30 Order.

Applicant sought review in the Fifth District Court of Appeal of Florida, which
denied, without comment, applicant's ""Emergency Petition for Writ of
Certiorari."" On the basis that the Fifth District Court of Appeal's denial is
not appealable to the Florida Supreme Court, see Fla. Rule App. Proc.
9.030(a)(2)(A)(ii) (2005), applicant filed with me as Circuit Justice an
application for a stay of the orders, urging that they operate as a prior
restraint in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United
States Constitution.  The application for a stay is denied.  It is not
sufficiently established on this record that applicant is enjoined by or
otherwise subject to the orders in question or that any threat to it is real or
substantial; hence it is unlikely that, despite indications that a prior
restraint may have been imposed at the time of the first order, four Members of
the Court would vote to grant certiorari.

[*1304]  II

Applicant argues that the orders operate as a prior restraint because they
threaten prosecution for future disclosures of the transcript and for contempt
of court for any future publication.  Specifically, the July 30 Order, at 2,
places ""[a]ll persons who have obtained a copy of the transcript . . . on notice
that any broadcast, publication, disclosure or communication of the contents of
this transcript is a violation of F. S. 905.27, punishable as a [**1626]
misdemeanor in addition to constituting grounds for Criminal Contempt of Court.""
This would apply to applicant, as it  [***594]  fell within the class of persons
who had obtained a copy of the transcript.

[HN2]  [***LEdHR2A] [2A] A threat of prosecution or criminal contempt against a
specific publication raises special First Amendment concerns, for it may chill
protected speech much like an injunction against speech by putting that party at
an added risk of liability.  The court's first order was not accompanied by
notice or hearing or any other of the usual safeguards of the judicial process.
It bears many of the marks of a prior restraint. See  Bantam Books, Inc. v.
Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 9 L. Ed. 2d 584, 83 S. Ct. 631 (1963).

[***LEdHR1A] [1B] The first order is of further concern because it singles out
this applicant and could be interpreted to place it on notice that publication
of grand jury testimony in the underlying case could subject it to prosecution
or place it in contempt of court.  Assuming that order constituted a prior
restraint, however, any chilling effect it had on speech was substantially
diminished by the court's second order.

That second order indicates that the court was directing its order only to the
conduct of those who are parties to the underlying action.  Applicant is not a
party.  See Aug. 9 Order, at 1 (""The Court's order clearly provides that the
parties to this action are enjoined . . .""); id., at 2 (""[T]he Court's order
does not enjoin the movant [applicant] in this case . . ."").  In this respect
the orders themselves, by their terms, do not prohibit speech by this applicant.

[*1305]  In addition, the second order forecloses interpreting the first order
to put applicant on notice that future publication would place it in contempt.
It notes that ""the Court's order does not enjoin [applicant] from publishing or
broadcasting materials that it wishes to . . . but rather solely points out that
so to do might constitute further violations of criminal law."" Ibid.

To the extent the court's orders might suggest a particular animus toward
applicant, that, too, has abated by virtue of the fact that the judge who
entered them has retired from judicial service.

Applicant argues that aside from the possibility of being held in contempt, it
fears prosecution by virtue of the orders.  Although it is true that ""[p]eople
do not lightly disregard public officers' thinly veiled threats to institute
criminal proceedings,""  Bantam Books, supra, at 68, 9 L. Ed. 2d 584, 83 S. Ct.
631, there is no suggestion that the judge who entered the orders here could
institute such a proceeding.   [HN3] In Florida, it does not appear that the
court may itself institute a prosecution for a violation of Fla. Stat.  § 905.27
(2003).  The decision to charge and prosecute is an executive responsibility,
and the state attorney has complete discretion in deciding whether and how to do
so.  See  State v. Bloom, 497 So. 2d 2, 3 (Fla. 1986) (citing Fla. Const., Art.
II, § 3).  See also  State v. Johns, 651 So. 2d 1227, 1228 (Fla. App. 1995)
(""The decision of whether to prosecute for a criminal offense is a function of
the executive authority, not the trial court"").  The court's orders are thus not
a prerequisite to prosecution, nor does the application demonstrate that
prosecution is any more likely because of them.  If prosecutors deemed
applicant's future publication to constitute a violation of Fla. Stat.  § 905.27
(2003), they would be free to prosecute applicant with or without the court's
orders.   [***595]  The court recognized as much when it stated in its Aug. 9
Order, at 2, that ""[t]he question of whether the publication or broadcast of
this information is a crime, [**1627]  is one  [*1306]  which must be left up to
further investigation and proper prosecution.""

Although the State has not guaranteed applicant immunity from prosecution for
future publication of the transcript, it has suggested that further publication
will not be prosecuted.  See State's Response to Application to Stay Prior
Restraint Order 4-5 (""Because the State Attorney did not believe that Petitioner
violated the grand jury secrecy statute . . . further publication of the grand
jury transcript would not have resulted in prosecution"").

[***LEdHR1A] [1C]  [***LEdHR2A] [2B] True,  [HN4] informal procedures undertaken
by officials and designed to chill expression can constitute a prior restraint.
See  Bantam Books, supra. Warnings from a court have added weight, and this too
has a bearing on whether there is a prior restraint. If it were to be shown that
even the second order might give a reporter or television station singled out
earlier any real cause for concern, the case for intervention would be stronger.
It appears, however, that any threat once implicit in the court's first order is
much diminished. The two orders, issued by a judge no longer in office, appear
to have been isolated phenomena, not a regular or customary practice.  Cf.  ibid
. Under these circumstances, in my view, there is no reasonable probability this
Court would grant a writ of certiorari. See  Graves v. Barnes, 405 U.S. 1201,
1203, 30 L. Ed. 2d 769, 92 S. Ct. 752 (1972) (Powell, J., in chambers).  The
application for a stay of the orders pending the filing of a petition for a writ
of certiorari is denied.

It is so ordered.

 [*1]  Justice Ginsburg, Circuit Justice.

This is an emergency application to vacate an order entered by the United States
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit staying a preliminary injunction entered
by the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut.  The
applicants--a member of the American Library Association referred to herein as
""John Doe,"" the American Civil Liberties Union, and the American Civil Liberties
Union Foundation--brought suit in district court, alleging that the
nondisclosure provision set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 2709(c) violates their First
Amendment right to freedom of speech.  The District Court granted the
applicants' motion for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of § 2709(c)
.  A panel of the Second Circuit granted the Government's motion to stay the
District Court's judgment pending an expedited [**2]  appeal.  The same panel
denied the applicants' subsequent motion to vacate the stay in light of changed
circumstances.  In view of the character of the constitutional issue presented
and the expedited schedule ordered by the Court of Appeals, I deny the
application and grant the parties' accompanying motions for leave to file under
seal.

[HN1] Section 2709, as amended by the Uniting and Strengthening America by
Providing [*2]  Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism
Act of 2001 (hereinafter Patriot Act), authorizes the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) to ""request the name, address, length of service, and local
and long distance toll billing records of a person or entity"" if the FBI asserts
in writing that the information sought is ""relevant to an authorized
investigation to protect against international terrorism or clandestine
intelligence activities . . . ."" 18 U.S.C. § 2709(b) (2000 ed., Supp. II).  The
provision authorizes the FBI to issue such requests to ""electronic communication
service providers."" § 2709(a) (2000 ed.).  In this case, the FBI requested
information under [**3]  this Section in the form of a ""National Security
Letter"" (NSL).  At issue in this case is § 2709(c), which prohibits the
recipient of an NSL from disclosing that fact.  Ibid. (prohibiting ""disclos[ure]
to any person that the [FBI] has sought or obtained access to information or
records under this section"").  The current debate over renewal of the Patriot
Act has spawned eight bills, currently pending before the Senate and the House
of Representatives, proposing various amendments and revisions to § 2709.

John Doe received an NSL demanding that it disclose ""any and all subscriber
information, billing information[,] and access logs of any person or entity""
associated with a specified Internet Protocol (IP) address during a specified
period.  The NSL tracked the language of § 2709 and included the admonition that
Doe was not to disclose that the FBI had sought or obtained information from it.
Doe brought suit in district court, alleging that the gag imposed by § 2709(c)
is an unlawful prior restraint on speech that is causing irreparable harm by
preventing Doe's effective [**4]  participation in the current debate--both in
Congress and among the public--regarding proposed revisions to the Patriot Act.

The District Court granted Doe's motion for a preliminary injunction, holding
that Doe demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits and
irreparable harm in the absence of the relief sought.  Emergency Application to
Vacate Stay, App. B, p 9 (hereinafter Application).  The court determined that,
as a ""categorical prohibition on the use of any fora for speech, on all topics
covered by § 2709(c),"" the gag provision is a prior restraint and a
content-based restriction on free speech.  Id., at 12-13.  The District Court
therefore concluded that the prohibition on disclosure is permissible only if it
satisfies strict scrutiny. Id., at 13.  In its strict-scrutiny analysis, the
court considered two Government interests the gag provision might serve: the
Government's general interest in national security and its particular interest
in conducting effective counterterrorism investigations.  Id., at 15.  While the
District Court acknowledged the Government's general interest in protecting
national security and its [**5]  expertise in the area of counterterrorism,
ibid., that court found ""nothing in the record"" (which included classified and
other sealed ex parte submissions) suggesting that the Government has a
compelling interest in preventing disclosure of Doe's identity.  Id., at 17, and
nn 7-8.

The Government's argument invoked a ""mosaic theory"": Although Doe's identity
""may appear innocuous by itself, it could still be significant to a terrorist
organization when combined with other information available to it."" Id., at 18.
The District Court acknowledged that federal courts have credited the mosaic
concept in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) context, but it noted that the
instant case is distinguishable in this respect: ""Th[e] difference between
seeking to obtain information and seeking to disclose information already
obtained raises [the plaintiffs']  [*3]  constitutional interests in this case
above the constitutional interests held by a FOIA claimant."" Id., at 19 (quoting
McGehee v. Casey, 231 U.S. App. D.C. 99, 718 F.2d 1137, 1147 (CADC 1983)).  In
any event, the court held, ""the defendants' conclusory statements that the
mosaic argument [**6]  is applicable here, absent supporting facts, would not
suffice to support a judicial finding to that effect."" Application, App. B, at
19-20.  The District Court noted in this regard that it had asked counsel for
the Government at oral argument if he could confirm that there was, in fact, a
""mosaic"" in this case--i.e., whether there are in fact other pieces of
information that, when combined with Doe's identity, would hinder the
investigation.  Counsel could not so confirm. Id., at 20.

The District Court did not ""question that national security can be a compelling
state interest, or that non-disclosure of [an] NSL recipient's identity could,
in some circumstances, serve that interest."" Ibid. It found, however, that the
Government failed to show a compelling interest in preventing disclosure in this
case:


     ""Based on the foregoing, including the sealed portion about Doe, and
     what Doe is, the nature and extent of information about the NSL that
     has already been disclosed by the defendants, and the nature and
     extent of the information that will not be disclosed, this court
     concludes that . . . the government has not demonstrated a compelling
     interest in preventing disclosure [**7]  of the recipient's identity.""
     Ibid. (footnote omitted).



The District Court concluded that, ""[e]specially in a situation like the instant
one, where the statute provides no judicial review of the NSL or the need for
its non-disclosure provision, . . . the permanent gag provision . . . is not
narrowly drawn to serve the government's broadly claimed compelling interest of
keeping investigations secret."" Id., at 22-23.  The court also appraised §
2709(c) as ""overbroad as applied with regard to the types of information that it
encompasses."" Id., at 23.  It found § 2709(c)'s ban ""particularly noteworthy"" in
light of the fact that proponents of the Patriot Act have ""consistently relied
on the public's faith [that the Government will] apply the statute narrowly . .
. ."" Id., at 26 (quoting Remarks of Attorney General John Ashcroft, Protecting
Life and Liberty (Memphis, Tenn., Sept. 18, 2003), available at
http://www.usdoj.gov/archive/ag/speeches/2003/091803memphisremarks.htm (as
visited Oct. 7, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court's case file)
(characterizing as ""hysteria"" fears of the Executive's abuse of the increased
[**8]  access to library records under the Patriot Act and stating that ""the
Department of Justice has neither the staffing, the time[,] nor the inclination
to monitor the reading habits of Americans.  No offense to the American Library
Association, but we just don't care."").

Having thus concluded that § 2709(c) fails strict scrutiny, the court granted
the applicants' motion for preliminary injunctive relief, but stayed its ruling
until September 20, 2005, to give the Government the opportunity to ""file an
expedited appeal and submit an application for a stay pending appeal.""
Application, App. B, at 29.  The Government did just that, and on September 20
the Court of Appeals granted the Government's motion:


     ""Although there is a question as to the likelihood of [the
     Government's] success on the merits and some injury to [the
     applicants] if a stay is granted, the [Government has] demonstrated
     that [it] will suffer irreparable harm and the public interest [will
     be] significantly injured if a stay is not granted.  The balance of
     harms tilts in favor of [the Government].   [*4]   Mohammed v. Reno,
     309 F.3d 95, 100 (CA2 2002) [**9]  .  This appeal is hereby expedited
     and the following briefing schedule is in effect: [The Government's]
     brief shall be filed no later than September 27, 2005; [the
     applicants'] brief shall be filed no later than October 4, 2005; [the
     Government's] reply brief shall be filed no later than October 10,
     2005."" Id., App. D.



Shortly after the Court of Appeals entered the stay, the parties learned that *
* * * * [REDACTED] * * * * *.  The parties also learned that * * * * *
[REDACTED] * * * * *. 1 The applicants immediately moved to vacate the stay in
light of this information.  The Court of Appeals denied the motion, ""on the
ground that the additional circumstances relied upon by [the movants] do not
materially alter the balance of harms . . . ."" Application, App. E.  The
applicants then filed the instant emergency application, urging me, in my
capacity as Circuit Justice, to vacate the stay and thereby allow Doe to
contribute its first-hand account to the ongoing debate regarding proposed
revisions to the Patriot Act.

 [**10]  In support of their plea for an immediate order lifting the stay, the
applicants stress that Doe seeks only to confirm its identity as the recipient
of an NSL.  It does not seek to disclose the content of the NSL, nor does it
seek to disclose the date on which it was received.  They point out that, in
another case bearing the same name involving a facial challenge to § 2709, the
Government argued that courts should consider the constitutionality of the gag
provision on a case-by-case basis, ""granting relief where--but only where--it
can be shown that the compelling governmental interest[s] underlying the
non-disclosure requirement are not in jeopardy."" Id., App. B, at 18, quoting
Defendants-Appellants' Reply Brief 25, in Gonzales v. Doe, No. 05-0570 (CA2
filed Feb. 3, 2005) (on appeal from  Doe v. Ashcroft, 334 F. Supp. 2d 471 (SDNY
2004)).  That is precisely what the District Court did here.  The applicants
underscore this anomaly: Doe--the only entity in a position to impart a
first-hand account of its experience--remains barred from revealing its
identity, while others * * * * * [REDACTED] * * * * * may speak freely [**11]
on that subject.

Although the applicants' arguments are cogent, I have taken into account several
countervailing considerations in declining to vacate the stay kept in place by
the Second Circuit pending its disposition of the appeal.  I am mindful, first,
that  [HN2] ""interference with an interim order of a court of appeals cannot be
justified solely because [a Circuit Justice] disagrees about the harm a party
may suffer.""  Certain Named and Unnamed Non-citizen Children v. Texas, 448 U.S.
1327, 1330-1331, 101 S. Ct. 12, 65 L. Ed. 2d 1151 (1980) (Powell, J., in
chambers).  Respect for the assessment of the Court of Appeals is especially
warranted when that court is proceeding to adjudication on the merits with due
expedition.  The principal briefs have been filed and I anticipate that the
Court of Appeals will hear argument promptly and render its decision with
appropriate care and dispatch.

Also weighing in favor of keeping the stay in effect pending the full airing the
Second Circuit has ordered, the District Court held unconstitutional--as applied
to the facts of this case--a provision of an Act of Congress.  A decision of
that moment warrants cautious review.  [**12]  Further, the Government points
out that the redacted version of the complaint, prepared in consultation with
the Government, identifies Doe as a member of the American [*5]  Library
Association.  ""The American Library Association,"" the Government footnotes,
""lobbies Congress on behalf of its members and is free to note that one of those
members has been served with an NSL.""

In sum, the applicants have not shown cause so extraordinary as to justify this
Court's intervention in advance of the expeditious determination of the merits
toward which the Second Circuit is swiftly proceeding.

Application for stay of execution of sentence of death presented to Justice
Thomas and by him referred to the Court denied. Temporary stay heretofore
entered vacated. Justice Souter would grant the application for stay of
execution.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

Because the State has not disputed the merits of petitioner's challenge to the
chemical protocol used by Missouri to carry out lethal injections, I would grant
the stay for the reasons stated in Judge Bye's dissenting opinion. 408 F.3d 1027
(CA8 2005). Assuming the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 applies, see 94
Stat. 352, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a), the State conceded at oral argument
before the District Court that there is no available remedy that the petitioner
has failed to invoke.
